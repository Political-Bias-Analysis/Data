            "article_content": "The push for racial equality has been met with resistance throughout American history \u2014 and that dynamic\u00a0is something liberals as well as conservatives have played a role in, Cornell University history professor Lawrence Glickman said. The \"resentment\" over the pace of the civil rights movement in the 1960s came to be known as white backlash, and it still plays a role in affecting policy today. White backlash in the United States dates back to at least the period after the Civil War, known as the Reconstruction, when there was \"a brief experiment in racial equality and interracial democracy,\" Glickman explained Thursday on CBSN. \"One of the key elements about the Reconstruction period was how quickly so many whites turned against it and thought it had gone too far and too fast,\" he said. \"I'm talking within one or two years of the close of the Civil War, you began to see this discourse about 'whoa, whoa, we need to slow down here,' when the fact is that racial equality was really only a glimmer at that point.\" The \"second attempt to build a true interracial democracy\" in the 1960s saw the same resistance and \"very similar language,\" Glickman said.\u00a0 \"A really important part of the language of backlash that white people used in the 1960s was that they really emphasized their own fears, which were typically unfounded about what the consequences of racial equality would be, and they also emphasized their own fragility, their own emotional concern,\" he said. \"It's such an inversion of what was really going on in history, which is that African Americans fighting for racial equality at that point had every right to be exhausted and fatigued and fed up and feeling fragile.\" The same \"language of special privileges\" can be heard today when people use the phrase \"all lives matter\" in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, Glickman said. \"A lot of proponents of the white backlash saw racial equality as some special gift, some special demand by African Americans, when it was simply a demand for social justice and equality,\" he said. \"I think we see the same thing with a language like 'all lives matter' \u2026 It's another inversion of demands for equality in which people who have more privilege relative to others feel like their privilege is being taken away when we shine a spotlight on injustice in American society.\" It was not just conservatives and southerners, \"but many northern white liberals who participated\" in backlash to the civil rights movement, Glickman said. And while backlash \"has become fundamental to modern conservatism,\" it has also been \"a huge constraint on American progressive and liberal politics.\" \"The reason for that is that so many liberal politicians are fearful of setting off a backlash,\" Glickman said. \"They're fearful of what happened in the 1960s happening again, which was when many white people left the Democratic coalition and eventually joined the Republican Party. Many backed off their previous support for New Deal-type reforms.\" The women's rights movement in the 1970s was also \"constrained by the fear of setting up backlash,\" Glickman said.\u00a0 But he noted that although President Lyndon B. Johnson was warned that white backlash over his support for civil rights legislation might cost him the election of 1964, Johnson won \"overwhelming.\" \"What he said was that there were a lot more 'frontlash' votes than backlash votes, and what he meant by that is that we hear disproportionately about people who oppose the civil rights movement but there are actually a lot of Americans who support it,\" he said.\u00a0 The Civil Rights Act became law in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act became law the next year.",

            "article_content": "Dear subscribers, Today is our final issue of Trail Markers of 2020. Thank you choosing us as a source of original reporting and analysis. Please click\u00a0here\u00a0to sign up for the Face the Nation newsletter and other breaking news alerts from CBS News. In his third appearance since election night, President Trump talked about his administration's work to lower the price of prescription drugs through regulations and argued its efforts could save Americans up to 30% in drug costs. He announced two new rules aimed at helping seniors, in particular. He also announced an end to the unapproved drugs initiative, which the administration says creates artificial monopolies for some older drugs. The president said that his administration would prevent exorbitant raises in drug prices and possibly save Americans billions of dollars. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the president also took the time to attack Big Pharma and \"their army of lawyers, lobbyists, and bought-and-paid-for politicians,\" while also claiming victory in the 2020 general election. CBS News has projected President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the contest. \"Big Pharma ran millions of dollars of negative advertisements against me during the campaign, which I won by the way but you know, you'll find that out -- almost 74 million votes,\" said Mr. Trump during the briefing. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0notes that it remains to be seen whether the incoming Biden administration would accept the Trump administration measures on prescription drug costs, something that may not have been lost on the president, despite his failure to formally concede the 2020 election. \"I just hope they keep it,\" President Trump said in an apparent reference to the Biden administration. \"I hope they have the courage to keep it, because the powerful drug lobby, big Pharma, is putting pressure on people like you wouldn't believe.\" Sganga\u00a0added that the president again alleged that Pfizer and others developing coronavirus vaccines retaliated against the administrations' policy changes by delaying the vaccine rollout, ultimately impacting the election. He did not back this up with any evidence. The\u00a0CBS News White House Unit\u00a0reports that White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany briefed reporters for the first time in roughly seven weeks during a 15-minute briefing on Friday afternoon. In what was also her first briefing since the election, McEnany was asked about the administration's refusal to coordinate with the Biden transition team.\u00a0CBS News White House associate producer Gabrielle Ake\u00a0reports that McEnany refuted Mr. Biden's previous comments suggesting that by withholding information, the Trump administration is hurting Americans. McEnany also said the president has not instructed her to not work with transition officials and that the GSA would make the call to work on transition \"at the right moment,\" citing the Transition Act. President-elect Joe Biden celebrated his 78th birthday on Friday by meeting with Democratic Congressional leaders, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. It was the first time Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have met in person with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer since the general election. \"In my Oval Office, mi casa, you casa,\" Biden told the Democratic leaders. \"I hope we're going to spend a lot of time together.\" As\u00a0Georgia completed its statewide certification of the 2020 general election results Friday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Vice President Pence visited the Peach State to help campaign for GOP Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler ahead of their highly anticipated Senate runoff races in January. Addressing a crowd of supporters, Pence said that the president wanted him to visit because they need Georgia to send Perdue and Loeffler back to a GOP majority, because it could be \"the last line of defense\" for all the administration has done \"to defend this nation, revive our economy and preserve the God-given liberties that we hold dear.\" Pence also vowed that the Trump campaign would \"keep fighting until every legal vote is counted\" and \"keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out.\" Now that the state has certified the 2020 general election results, the Trump campaign has two business days to request a recount, which would be conducted using scanning machines. As President-elect Joe Biden lays the groundwork for his transition to the presidency, President Trump still refuses to acknowledge his defeat and is instead looking to the courts to rescue his chances for a second term in the White House, though in most cases unsuccessfully. Since\u00a0Election\u00a0Day, the number of lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and Republican voters in an effort to halt the certification of election results has swelled to more than a dozen, with the legal battles focused on a handful of key battleground states where Mr. Trump lost. The president continues to claim the cases provide him a pathway to victory over Mr. Biden, but they involve too few ballots for him to close the president-elect's\u00a05.5 million-vote lead\u00a0or change the outcome of a state's race. Mr. Biden secured 306 electoral votes to Mr. Trump's 232. Harvard Law School professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos\u00a0told CBSN in an interview\u00a0Monday, \"There have been something like 30 or 40 of these lawsuits filed in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and so on. To this point, dozens of defeats have piled up for the Trump campaign.\" On Monday, four different cases brought by voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia who sought to exclude some counties from being included in state certification of the election were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs. All four voter groups were represented by conservative elections lawyer James Bopp, Jr., who declined to say why the cases were dismissed. He told the\u00a0Detroit Free Press\u00a0in an email, \"Sorry because of atty. client privilege and because I do not telegraph my next moves, I cannot comment.\" The cases were all dismissed without prejudice, so they may be revised and refiled. The increasingly steep climb to victory hasn't stopped Mr. Trump from\u00a0making unsubstantiated assertions\u00a0that he won the election or claiming it was rigged against him, despite the absence of any evidence to support his allegations. Instead, the president has\u00a0beefed up\u00a0his legal team, spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani, and\u00a0suggested\u00a0more lawsuits are coming. CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn\u00a0takes a look\u00a0HERE\u00a0at the current legal fights being waged by the president and Republicans in the courts, and where they each stand. From Election Day through the end of the year, ahead of the Georgia Senate runoffs on January 5,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports that more than $170 million is slated to be spent on television and radio ads in the Georgia Senate runoff races according to Kantar/CMAG data. The massive investment in paid advertising comes as control of the Senate hangs in the balance, where a pick-up of two Senate seats by Democrats would tilt the Senate slightly in their favor, a 50-50 tie, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking any ties. Leading the way on spending is Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, who is slated to invest more than $40 million for the runoff. She's followed by Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff -- who is challenging Republican Senator David Perdue. Ossoff is scheduled to spend nearly $38 million and Democrat Reverend Rafael Warnock -- who is challenging Loeffler -- has placed at least $33 million in advertising. Perdue is expected to spend at least $27 million on ads as of now according to the recent tracking. Other big spenders between November 3 and the runoff include the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee with more than $5.6 million, Republican Super PAC American Crossroads with at least $4.7 million, the Mitch McConnell-affiliated Super PAC Senate Leadership Fund with $4.6 million and the National Republican Senatorial Committee with at least $4 million. Currently, candidates and supporting groups are not spending on Facebook ads due to a\u00a0post-general election ban on ads\u00a0still in place by the social network. Former President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0took a light-hearted jab Thursday at President Donald Trump, who has\u00a0refused to concede\u00a0the\u00a0election\u00a0to President-elect Joe Biden, reports\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Sophie Lewis. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel asked Mr. Obama what might happen if an unnamed person -- presumably Mr. Trump - were trying to hide in the White House. \"You know the White House well. You lived there for eight years. Are there places someone could hide? Like, if, say, they were going to be removed?\" Kimmel asked the former president\u00a0on his show\u00a0Thursday. \"There's little cubby holes or anything we should know about?\" \"Well, I think we can always send the Navy SEALs in there to dig him out,\" Mr. Obama replied, laughing. Mr. Trump has\u00a0refused to concede\u00a0the election, even as\u00a0state recounts\u00a0have confirmed the outcome. He has continued to spread\u00a0baseless claims\u00a0of voter fraud and filed lawsuits in several battleground states. The Trump campaign has so far\u00a0lost\u00a0most of its lawsuits. While there is no precedent for forcibly removing a president on Inauguration Day,\u00a0Mr. Biden has said\u00a0that he \"is absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.\" The Trump administration has also denied Mr. Biden's team access to crucial transition materials. Multiple sources told CBS News on Thursday that there is\u00a0\"marginal\" backchannel communication\u00a0between the transition team and Trump administration officials. Mr. Obama told Kimmel, \"I wish the transition was going better, because we lose time during these crises.\" The former president compared the coronavirus crisis to the financial crisis he experienced as he entered his first term in 2009. \"When I came in, we were in the middle of a big crisis: the financial crisis,\" Mr. Obama said. \"George W. Bush -- he and I had obviously big policy differences -- but he's a good man. He is a patriot. And he ordered everybody on his team to work seamlessly with us on the transition.\" He added that Mr. Bush \"could not have been more gracious, could not have been more helpful. And that actually helped us be able to get a head start on trying to stem what could have been a great depression instead of a great recession.\" Few Republicans have spoken out publicly against President Trump's refusal to concede the election he definitively lost, as he and his legal team continue to promote claims of voter fraud they have not proven,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers. Mr. Trump's campaign has launched lawsuits in several states won by President-elect Joe Biden alleging voting discrepancies, but nearly all of these challenges have been unsuccessful. This hasn't stopped the president's legal team from continuing to claim that fraud occurred. In a rambling, often incoherent news conference on Thursday, the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani accused Democrats of trying to steal the election, though he presented no evidence for this. Giuliani and other attorneys have been unable to provide any evidence of fraud in several of their lawsuits, and many of the lawsuits do not allege fraud. Mr. Biden is projected to have won the election with 306 electoral votes, well beyond the necessary 270, and he won the popular vote by more than 5 million votes. But a few Senate Republicans have spoken against Mr. Trump and his attorneys' lies about the election. Senators Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse and Joni Ernst criticized the president for undermining Americans' faith in the democratic process and refusing to provide evidence to back his politically motivated and false claims that the election was rigged. \"Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespread fraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resorted to overt pressure to state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election,\" Romney said in a statement posted to Twitter. \"It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American president.\" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Friday certified President-elect Joe Biden's win and the results of all the other races in the state, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell,\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers\u00a0and\u00a0digital editor Caroline Linton. In a statement, Raffensperger said this \"will affirm that all 159 counties have provided to the state the total votes tabulated for each state and federal candidate.\" Now that the results have been certified, Mr. Trump has\u00a0two business days\u00a0to request another recount, since the results still show a margin of 0.5% or less. If the Trump campaign does ask for another recount, it will be a machine recount. Georgia was one of five states\u00a0Mr. Biden flipped from President Trump\u00a0in 2016. Mr. Biden won the state by a margin of 0.3%. The state has not voted to send a Democrat to the White House since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. In a brief press conference Friday, Republican Governor Brian Kemp said he joined many \"in backing a hand recount and urging a thorough investigation into any voting irregularities.\" Now, he said he's encouraging Raffensperger to consider addressing concerns that some have regarding matching signatures and proposed that his office conduct a sample audit of signatures on the absentee ballot envelopes and compare those to the signatures on applications and on file at the secretary of state's office. Earlier in the day\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0joined\u00a0CBSN anchor Anne-Marie Green\u00a0to break down the completion of the state's risk-limiting audit, which showed that the original machine count accurately portrayed President-elect Joe Biden as the winner in the state. VotingWorks Executive Director Ben Adida said in a statement that \"Georgia's first statewide audit successfully confirmed the winner of the chosen contest and should give voters increased confidence in the results.\" The secretary of state's office also noted that the highest error rate in any county recount during the manual audit was less than 1% and that most counties found no change in their final tally. In a press conference Friday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said that while he believes the election results that his office reached are correct, he also believes the state's election laws need to be reformed. \"I want to do everything I can to build trust in our electoral system,\" said Raffensperger. \"To that end, I want to work with the governor and legislators on legislation that improves our current system.\" Specifically, he vowed to work with state legislators to create more secure measures for absentee ballots like the use of photo identification to replace signature matching. This comes on the heels of a\u00a0civil complaint\u00a0against Raffensperger that was dismissed Thursday, calling for absentee ballots from the 2020 general election to not be tabulated. Raffensperger also said that he would like to see legislation that allows for the state to intervene in counties that have systemic issues with administering elections and mentioned that the risk-limiting audit revealed that some counties hadn't counted votes, which can't be allowed to happen again. Michigan's top Republicans in the state legislature went to the White House to meet with President Trump on Friday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 House Speaker Lee Chatfield, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and other Republicans from the state legislature attended the meeting.\u00a0 \"We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan's electors, just as we have said throughout this election,\" Chatfield and Shirkey said in a joint statement following the meeting. \"Michigan's certification process should be a deliberate process free from threats and intimidation. Allegations of fraudulent behavior should be taken seriously, thoroughly investigated, and if proven, prosecuted to the full extent of the law. And the candidates who win the most votes win elections and Michigan's electoral votes. These are simple truths that should provide confidence in our elections.\"\u00a0 President-elect Joe Biden leads President Trump by more than 154,000 votes in Michigan. Ahead of the meeting,\u00a0Democrats expressed concerns\u00a0that Mr. Trump might try to pressure the lawmakers to go against the popular vote in Michigan. \u00a0Michigan's Board of State Canvassers is set to meet on Monday to discuss certifying the election results. The board has two Democrats and two Republicans. A majority of the members need to vote to certify the results. Two Wisconsin counties began recounting votes on Friday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Earlier this week, the Trump campaign requested recounts in Dane County, home to Madison, and Milwaukee County. In Dane County, the Trump campaign tried to throw out tens of thousands of absentee ballots, but this was rejected by election officials. The campaign said votes should be discarded from early in-person absentee voting, mail ballots that can't be tied to written applications, absentee ballots where election workers wrote in a witness' address and ballots from voters who said they were indefinitely confined. All of those challenges were rejected 3-0 by the Dane County Board of Canvassers, except the indefinitely confined ballots, which was rejected by a 2-1 vote along party lines, with two Democrats saying those ballots should be counted. The Trump Campaign could challenge these ballots in a lawsuit.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Trump fired Secretary of Defense Mark Esper over Twitter on Monday, less than a week after the election, ousting his third defense secretary months after a public dispute over deploying U.S. troops on American soil to tamp down on protests. \"Mark Esper has been terminated,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote. \"I would like to thank him for his service.\" White House chief of staff Mark Meadows called Esper on Monday shortly before the president's tweet to tell him he was fired, a defense official told CBS News. Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he was installing Christopher Miller, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, as acting secretary, effective immediately. Miller was spotted entering the Pentagon Monday afternoon. Leading Democrats in Congress protested Esper's firing, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi House Speaker calling the move \"disturbing evidence that President Trump is intent on using his final days in office to sow chaos in our American Democracy and around the world.\"\u00a0 \"Continuity and stability are always important during a presidential transition; they are absolutely imperative at this moment, as this historically erratic administration prepares for its departure,\" Pelosi said in a statement. In a letter to his department that didn't mention Mr. Trump once, Esper said it has been \"the honor and privilege of a lifetime to serve alongside you as the 27th U.S. Secretary of Defense.\" \"While I step aside knowing there is much more we could accomplish together to advance America's national security, there is much achieved in the time we had to improve the readiness, capabilities, and professionalism of the joint force, while fundamentally transforming and preparing it for the future,\" Esper wrote. Esper fell out of favor with the president months ago, and reports have swirled for several weeks that Mr. Trump was preparing to fire him after the election. An\u00a0NBC News report\u00a0last week that Esper had prepared a letter of resignation prompted a denial by the Pentagon, with a spokesperson saying he had no plans to step down.\u00a0 The defense chief publicly contradicted Mr. Trump over the administration's response to protests against racial injustice over the summer,\u00a0saying in June that he did not support invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty military troops to the streets to quell unrest. \"The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,\" he said as protests over the police killing of George Floyd roiled cities across the country. \"We are not in one of those situations now.\" His comments came several days after a contentious Oval Office meeting in which Mr. Trump demanded 10,000 active-duty troops be deployed immediately, according to a senior administration official who described the events at the time. Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley objected to the demand, this official said, and later encouraged governors to call up their own National Guard forces to eliminate the need for troops. Milley and Esper appeared alongside the president outside a church near the White House for a much-criticized photo-op with the Bible. Police used tear gas to violently remove peaceful demonstrators from Lafayette Park to clear the way for the president, who was flanked by the defense chief, the Joint Chiefs chairman and other administration officials. Esper and Milley were apparently unaware of the president's intentions when they joined him. In an\u00a0interview with The Military Times\u00a0conducted November 4 and published Monday after news of his firing, Esper defended his tenure at the Pentagon and said he does \"everything I can to try and stay apolitical, trying to stay out of situations that may appear political.\" \"And sometimes I'm successful at doing that. And sometimes I'm not as successful,\" he added. The White House disputed the characterization of the earlier Oval Office meeting at which Esper rebuffed the president's demands for troops, but his public comments opposing the use of the Insurrection Act several days later were not well-received at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pointedly declined to say the president still had confidence in his defense secretary. \"With regard to whether the president has confidence, I would say, if he loses confidence in Secretary Esper, I'm sure you all will be the first to know,\" McEnany said at a briefing on June 3. After the public exchange with the White House, Esper largely stayed out of the public spotlight. He last held a briefing at the Pentagon in July and embarked on a series of foreign trips.\u00a0 In August, Mr. Trump derided Esper as \"Yesper\" when asked if he was considering firing him, an apparent reference to critics' contention that Esper was a \"yes-man.\" \"I consider firing everybody,\" the president told reporters. \"At some point, that's what happens.\" In his Military Times interview, Esper disputed the notion that he was a \"yes-man.\" \"My frustration is I sit here and say, 'Hm, 18 Cabinet members. Who's pushed back more than anybody?' Name another Cabinet secretary that's pushed back,\" he said. \"Have you seen me on a stage saying, 'Under the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?' \" David Martin contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "In an\u00a0interview with CBS News on Tuesday, President Trump said the killing of George Floyd was \"terrible\" but appeared to bristle when asked why Black Americans are \"still dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country.\" \"So are White people. So are White people. What a terrible question to ask. So are White people,\" Mr. Trump told\u00a0CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge\u00a0at the White House. \"More White people, by the way. More White people.\"\u00a0 CBS News political reporter Grace Segers\u00a0reports\u00a0that police departments are not required to report comprehensive data on police killings, but researchers have compiled statistics showing Black Americans are more likely to die at the hands of law enforcement than White people. One\u00a0study published in 2018 found that Black men are roughly 3.5 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than White men.\u00a0Another study released in 2019 found that 1 in 1,000 Black men in the U.S. can expect to die at the hands of police over the course of their lifetimes. A study by Harvard researchers\u00a0published in late June found that the number of White people killed by the police between 2013 and 2017 was higher than any other demographic. But White people constitute a larger portion of the population than Black people, and the study also showed that Black people were three times more likely to be killed by law enforcement officers than White Americans. Mr. Trump's comments come after weeks of nationwide protests against police brutality and racial violence instigated by the death of Floyd, an unarmed Black man who was killed in Minneapolis after a White police officer pressed a knee to his neck for almost nine minutes. Mr. Trump said he believed Floyd's death was \"terrible\" in the interview with\u00a0Herridge. Mr. Trump's critics have accused him of overtly appealing to white supremacists through his continued defense of the Confederate flag and statues of Confederate officials. Mr. Trump said in Tuesday's interview that he believed the debate over the flag is a freedom of speech issue. \"All I say is freedom of speech. It's very simple. My attitude is freedom of speech. Very strong views on the Confederate flag. With me, it's freedom of speech. Very simple. Like it, don't like it, it's freedom of speech,\" Mr. Trump said. He previously said in 2015 that he believed the Confederate flag should be in a museum. When asked if he would be \"comfortable\" with supporters displaying the Confederate flag at his campaign events, Mr. Trump demurred. \"You know, it depends on what your definition is. But I am comfortable with freedom of speech. It's very simple,\" Mr. Trump said. Herridge\u00a0pressed the president on whether he understood \"why the flag is a painful symbol for many people because it's a reminder of slavery.\" \"Well, people love it and I don't view \u2014 I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're not thinking about slavery. I look at NASCAR \u2014 you go to NASCAR, you had those flags all over the place. They stopped it,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to the decision by NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag from its events. The president has also criticized Bubba Wallace, NASCAR's only Black full-time driver, saying Wallace should apologize for an incident involving a noose that was discovered in his garage stall at a speedway in Alabama. \"I just think it's freedom of speech, whether it's freedom of speech, whether it's Confederate flags or Black Lives Matter or anything else you want to talk about. It's freedom of speech,\" Mr. Trump continued. Mr. Trump also slammed school districts that are hesitant to reopen for in-person classes in the fall over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0telling CBS News\u00a0that the districts were making a \"terrible decision.\" Mr. Trump told\u00a0Herridge\u00a0that the Los Angeles Unified School District had made a \"mistake\" in deciding not to reopen in the fall, joining a number of school districts across the country who have said the same. \"What do you tell parents and teachers who feel that it is unsafe to go back?\" Herridge asked Mr. Trump. \"I would tell parents and teachers that you should find yourself a new person whoever is in charge of that decision, because it's a terrible decision,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because children and parents are dying from that trauma, too. They're dying because they can't do what they're doing. Mothers can't go to work because all of a sudden they have to stay home and watch their child, and fathers.\" The president said that being unable to send children to school puts a \"tremendous strain\" on parents, and called the issue a \"balancing act.\" \"We have to open our schools,\" Mr. Trump said. The president has repeatedly pushed for reopening schools and universities in the fall, even as coronavirus cases climb in dozens of states. Mr. Trump said opponents of reopening schools are making a political calculation, hoping to keep him from winning a second term in office. \"I also say a decision like that is politics, because we're starting to do very well in the polls, because I'm for law and order. I'm for strong business. Our jobs are coming back at a record level like we've never seen anything like it. \u00a0Record level. We're heading up. It's turning out to be the V just like \u2014 I built it once before, the strongest economy ever. I'm doing it again,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that \"they don't want it to happen,\" referring to \"the Democrats and the radical left.\" \u00a0JOE BIDEN Joe Biden is boosting his commitment to \"a clean energy future\" with a $2 trillion clean energy and infrastructure plan, which he says will create \"millions\" of jobs and move the U.S. closer to a carbon-free future,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. His infrastructure plan would spread the $2 trillion cost over 4 years. It's now substantially more expensive than the clean energy and infrastructure plan Biden proposed last year, which was $1.7 trillion over a 10-year period. The Biden campaign says the plan would be paid for with a combination of stimulus and increases in the corporate tax rate. Speaking in Delaware on Tuesday, Biden said his overall recognition of climate change contrasts himself and President Trump. Biden said Mr. Trump sees climate change as a \"hoax\" when Biden views climate change as \"jobs.\" The 14-page plan commits to creating one million new jobs in the auto industry, including parts and materials manufacturing for electric vehicles, millions of union jobs to build infrastructure, one million jobs to upgrade four million buildings over four years, additional construction jobs for 1.5 million new sustainable housing units, and 250,000 jobs \"plugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells and reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines.\" There's also a new clean energy goal: Biden is accelerating this commitment to 2035 for a carbon pollution-free power sector, with net-zero emissions throughout the economy by 2050.\u00a0Read more here on the plan. PRESIDENT TRUMP Mr. Trump is visiting Georgia on Wednesday in an official capacity to talk about infrastructure, but like his recent trips to Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, the official visit is to a battleground state his campaign wants to keep in the win column in November, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker rates Georgia as a toss-up state for the presidential election. Voters in Georgia have not picked a Democratic president since 1992, but the gains Democrats have made in recent elections with key groups have made it a state to watch. Mr. Trump won the state in 2016 by 5 points, underperforming former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who beat President Obama in the state by 8 points. Suburban counties contributed in part to the Democrats' gains. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the suburban counties of Gwinnett and Cobb outside Atlanta that voted for Romney in 2012. \u00a0The Trump campaign has recently made significant ad buys in Georgia. According to data from CMAG/Kantar, the campaign has about $2.4 million in reservations from July to Election Day. In the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Mr. Trump announced he will sign a bill and executive order to hold China accountable for \"suppressive actions against Hong Kong.\" Earlier this month, the US Senate unanimously approved legislation punishing China with sanctions, after China acted to suppress Hong Kong's democratic freedoms. Mr. Trump declared his executive order would also end preferential treatment and special privileges for Hong Kong. During his hour long remarks, the president criticized Joe Biden at length, attacking him on issues ranging from foreign policy to climate change to trade, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese communist party and to the calamity of errors that they've made. They've made so many errors,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House press conference. \"And it's been devastating for the American worker.\" Asked by\u00a0CBS News Radio correspondent Steven Portnoy\u00a0if he felt like an underdog ahead of November's election, Mr. Trump responded, \"No, I don't. I think we have really good poll numbers.\" The president later stated that he felt he had a \"great chance\" of winning reelection. \"I think we're going to have a lot of people show up. I'm very worried about mail-in voting,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I think it's subject to tremendous fraud. It's being rigged.\" While\u00a0concerns about quickly scaling up vote-by mail infrastructure\u00a0have surfaced recently, evidence shows very few instances of absentee voting fraud within key battleground states. SUSAN RICE In an interview with The Washington Post, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice was critical of Mr. Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rice said the president \"championed the premature reopening of various states,\" reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. \u00a0\"What we are reaping now is the result of that extraordinarily irresponsible rush to reopen,\" Rice said. On Trump's push to reopen schools this fall, Rice said, \"He's willing to sacrifice the health and the safety of our children, their teachers, the staffs at these schools in order to convey the false reality, the false message that America is back and ready to reopen.\" In a separate interview with MSNBC, Rice, who also served as national security adviser in the Obama administration, responded to questions that she is under consideration to be presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's running mate. \"I will do everything I can and whatever it is Joe Biden wants me to do to help him succeed in becoming president and succeed in governing,\" Rice said. \"If that's as his running mate, I'd be extraordinarily honored to even be considered for that. If that's in some other capacity or if it's simply doing the day-to-day work of trying to get out the vote, I'll do whatever it takes because this is so critical.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren and Representative Ayanna Pressley on Tuesday called on Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to issue a report on racial health disparities, reports\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. Such reports to Congress are required every other year by the Affordable Care Act,\u00a0 stopped under Mr. Trump, the lawmakers wrote, even as Black and Hispanic Americans are dying of COVID-19 at higher rates than their white counterparts. \"Without successfully addressing these racial disparities in health outcomes and health care access, we will not be able to mitigate and fully control the COVID-19 pandemic,\" they wrote. \"You have, to date, failed to do so, with tragic consequences.\" They also requested Azar release the latest reports from the six sub-agencies for the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health and provide them with a list of actions that offices within HHS have taken to address racial disparities in health outcomes. Warren also joined Senators Chris Van Hollen and Catherine Cortez Masto in requesting that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department make it easier for state and local governments to receive and pay back federal pandemic bailout loans. \"Our nation's recovery efforts must start with supporting local communities, and we are concerned that, without additional efforts from the Fed and Treasury, giant corporations will reap all the benefits of this recovery while cities and states are left behind and suffer needless economic devastation,\" they wrote in a letter that was sent Friday to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and released Tuesday. The lawmakers asked Powell and Mnuchin to reconsider the terms of the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) and give state and local governments extended periods to pay off those loans with at least the rates given to businesses with poorer credit than the borrowers. They also said the Fed and Treasury should allow smaller governments to receive MLF loans and consider allowing some to receive loans through the Main Street Lending Program. CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In the next 30 days, Jill Rubinstein will make a decision about whether to permanently close her specialty shoe store, Footloose, after 33 years amid an effort take the store totally online.  Rubenstein, a third-generation shoe store owner, has been losing money by keeping her Pittsburgh boutique open this year and was forced to get a second job to cover her family's health insurance. \"[Business] was dwindling, but now it's like putting the nail in the coffin,\" she said. The pandemic has driven her sales down by 90%. Stories like Rubinstein's have become commonplace across the retail industry. COVID-19 is leaving millions of Americans jobless or working from home and as a result, they're buying less. Clothing and shoe sales dropped nationally more than 40% over the first five months of the year from the same period in 2019, the Census Department estimates. As bankruptcy filings of national retailers like Brooks Brothers dominate headlines, the owners of some local specialty stores in the battleground state of Pennsylvania have found themselves facing unprecedented hurdles in the marketplace. In this\u00a0latest edition of CBS News COVID Chronicles,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0highlights those challenges. With coronavirus cases on the rise in Florida, Republicans are actively planning to move three nights of their party's convention in Jacksonville from the Vystar Veterans Memorial Arena to an outdoor venue, a source familiar with campaign thinking confirms to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0Republicans involved in planning tell CBS News they are staging for multiple scenarios during the GOP's Florida nominating convention, including various health precautions amid surging pandemic levels. As part of ongoing planning, the Republican National Committee has already signed contracts with multiple outdoor venues in Jacksonville surrounding the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena. A senior advisor to Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign tells CBS News the president's re-election bid is \"reassessing\" Mr. Trump's mega events following his campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that during a press conference on Tuesday, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry said the city has used CARES Act funding to\u00a0 \"significantly\" expand testing. When asked whether Jacksonville received additional testing due to the Republican National Convention wanting to assess how widespread COVID-19 was ahead of the national convention in August, Curry said \"as it relates to the additional federal sites, no one has said to me that they're here for that reason.\" FLORIDA According to Florida Department of Health data, Florida now has nearly 300,000 positive COVID-19 cases throughout the state. After more than 15,000 new cases were reported on Sunday, the highest one-day increase in cases in any state in the pandemic so far,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports\u00a0the state has seen a drop in the past two days, though the positivity rate has increased during that time period. Florida continues to hold the third-highest number of coronavirus cases of any state, behind California and New York.\u00a0 The president and vice president have made multiple visits to the state in the months since the state began tracking the spread of COVID-19 cases. On Saturday, Vice President Pence visited Jacksonville and was pictured without a mask, sparking questions on whether the city's mask mandate had been violated. During a press conference on Tuesday, Mayor Curry's chief of staff said the event followed the mandate because social distancing could take place. The city mandate requires masks to be worn where social distancing cannot take place.\u00a0 And Florida Trump Victory campaign announced Tuesday that it has 170 paid staffers throughout the state with 1,500 field staffers across the country. The Republican Party of Florida also notes that Florida Trump Victory has made 10 million voter contacts and nearly 9,000 volunteers have been trained and activated throughout the state.\u00a0 \u00a0 MICHIGAN With an uptick in COVID-19 cases in Michigan, Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer extended Michigan's state of emergency through August 11, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Last week, Whitmer signed an executive order reiterating the need for people to be wearing face coverings in indoor public places. The executive order also requires businesses to refuse service to customers who do not wear face coverings with limited exceptions. \"Throughout this crisis, the vast majority of Michiganders have done their part, but we must remain vigilant and continue to do everything we can to protect our loved ones,\" Whitmer said in a statement. \"That means wearing a mask over your mouth and nose and practicing safe physical distancing when going out in public. If we all do our part now, there is a greater chance that schools can resume in-person learning in the fall.\" NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper announced during a press conference Tuesday that the state will reopen schools for in-person and remote learning in the fall, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. While the state is still working through health guidance for colleges and universities, K-12 teachers, staff, and students will be required to wear face coverings. The state plans to provide at least five reusable face coverings for every student, teacher and staff member. Symptom screenings, including temperature checks, will take place daily before students enter schools, which are required to create a way to isolate students who have symptoms and ensure they can get home safely. The state has also provided a two-month supply of thermometers and medical-grade equipment has also been delivered to schools for school nurses to use to ensure safety. A medical expert also presented information during the presser and cited data that shows children are less likely to contract, spread or get ill due to COVID-19. The chairman of the state's Board of Education also called on the federal government to provide funding to help safely re-open schools for teachers and the nearly 1.6 million public school students throughout the state. TEXAS Despite increasing coronavirus cases,\u00a0CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0report turnout for Texas' runoff election has been high. According to\u00a0data from the Secretary of State's office, more than 1 million people voted early, either in-person or via mail. 653,942 Democrats showed up in part to cast their vote for a Democratic Senate nominee, while 409,446 Republicans already cast votes in a litany of House runoffs. Comparatively, the early vote is much higher than runoffs in 2016 and 2018, though the early\u00a0voting period itself was extended in the July contests due to COVID-19.\u00a0 Texas has become a recent hotspot for COVID-19, seeing a high of more than 10,000 new cases on July 7. Even before the resurgence, Democrats launched multiple efforts to expand who can vote by mail. Their attempts fell short at the state's Supreme Court and a petition still remains at the U.S. Supreme Court, who said they would not accelerate the process for the runoff. In response to recent spikes, Republican Governor Greg Abbott issued a statewide mask mandate earlier this month (and was quickly censured by eight Republican county committees because of it). However, he exempted runoff voters and workers from his executive order. \"We don't want to deny somebody the ability to go vote simply because they don't have a mask,\" he said in an early July press conference. Amid the pandemic, two poll workers in Collin County, in the Dallas Metro area, left their sites on Tuesday because some of their counterparts were not wearing masks, according to Texas Democratic Party voter protection director Rose Clouston. \"They left because they didn't feel like they could safely work in that space all day,\" Clouston told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The example shows another challenge officials may face for staffing in-person voting in November: Not just finding people who are willing to work, but making sure they feel safe on Election Day. \u00a0\"The whole time that we have been recruiting over the last several months, people who normally work have been saying, you know, I'm here for this election and I support everything we're doing and I want to be there so badly. But, you know, I have been quarantining for three months and, you know, I live with an elderly person or I myself am at risk and I just can't take on that risk of being at a polling place for 14 hours and being exposed to other people, other voters and other election workers in that way,\" Clouston said. She's hopeful the administration \"takes the lessons from today's election and makes changes and provides the guidance counties need in a much more timely basis.\" One of those workers, 59-year-old Cynthia Riley, left her polling location in Plano, Texas, just before polls were set to open. She said she didn't feel comfortable sitting next to people not wearing masks for 14 hours. \"For me to be expected for $12 an hour to sit there next to a bunch of yahoo's who can't do the most basic thing; wear a mask. It's not worth it,\" Riley told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. \"I know if they can't even put a mask on they're not doing anything else. Lord knows where they've been.\" HEALTH CARE A\u00a0newly released study\u00a0finds the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic crisis has caused the greatest health insurance losses in American history, raising new concerns in the national debate over reliance on employers to provide health insurance, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the report by the national nonpartisan organization Families USA, an estimated 5.4 million people became uninsured due to job loss from February to May of this year due to the pandemic. And that does not include those workers' family members who also lost insurance as a result. The study states the estimated increase would be 39% higher than any annual increase ever recorded. States that saw the highest increases in uninsured workers include California, Texas, New York, Florida and North Carolina which amount to nearly half of all increases. As of now, eight states now have at least 20% or more adults uninsured including Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina.\u00a0 The study noted that all but Oklahoma are among the 15 states with the highest spikes in new cases the week ending July 12. While Congress has passed legislation in response to the pandemic, no federal legislation has restored or preserved health insurance. IN THE SENATE ARIZONA Democratic Arizona Senate candidate Mark Kelly announced Tuesday he raised nearly $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 in his bid to unseat Senator Martha McSally, the most he has raised of any quarter to date, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. \u00a0According to his campaign, the average donation was about $44, and nearly 90% of contributions for the quarter were under $100.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0notes that Kelly had last touted in April raising a then-record $11 million, nearly double Republican Sen. Martha McSally's total of $6.3 million. To date, his campaign in the battleground state has raised $44 million this cycle including donations from nearly 396,000 people. McSally has not yet released her fundraising total but must file Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission. Kelly marks the latest in a number of Democratic Senate hopefuls to disclose record fundraising sums, even amid a pandemic that has crippled the nation's economy. IN THE HOUSE NEW MEXICO According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small\u00a0announced the launch of her first television ad of the cycle Tuesday, pledging to \"work with anyone who wants to deliver for New Mexico.\" The Democrat added $132,675 in broadcast and television ad spending Monday, according to Kantar/CMAG data. \"I put politics aside and worked with Republicans, Democrats, and President Trump to pass the coronavirus relief plan,\" Torres Small says\u00a0in the ad, which quickly prompted a rebuttal\u00a0from her GOP rival.\u00a0 The announcement comes as top Democrats\u00a0raised skepticism over Republicans' chances in New Mexico, speaking Saturday at the virtual launch of the state party's \"New Mexico for All\" coordinated campaign. Though Joe Biden has often\u00a0polled ahead of Mr. Trump statewide, the House GOP's campaign arm this week released polling\u00a0they claim shows Torres Small tied with Yvette Herrell, her Republican challenger, in a district she won by barely a point\u00a0in 2018.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence defended President Trump's push to confirm a new justice to the Supreme Court before Election Day, telling \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell in an exclusive interview that moving forward with a confirmation during an election year is not without precedent and the president has an \"obligation\" to put forth a nominee. \"President Trump believes that he has an obligation under the Constitution of the United States to put forward a nominee for the Supreme Court,\" Pence said. \"There have been 29 times that there have been vacancies since George Washington through Barack Obama. In all 29 cases, the president has made a nomination to the Supreme Court during an election year,\" he continued. \"And President Trump believes that it's his responsibility and his duty to do that again.\" A 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service found 13 instances of Supreme Court seats becoming vacant before Election Day during election years since 1791. In nine of those instances, presidents submitted nominees to fill the seat before the election. Ginsburg's death 46 days before Election Day is the second-shortest amount of time between a seat becoming vacant and an election, behind only Chief Justice Roger Taney's death in October 1864. Judges Amy Coney Barrett of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the leading contenders for the nomination, met with Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday, a source close to the president told CBS News. Pence hailed Barrett and the other finalists, saying the president \"has made it clear that it's our objective to appoint pro-life jurists to our federal courts at every level.\" \"What I'm convinced of is that Judge Barrett and the other finalists on the list will interpret the Constitution in a way that's consistent with the great tradition of Justice Antonin Scalia,\" Pence said. Ginsburg died Friday at the age of 87 from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer, and Mr. Trump is urging the Senate to quickly take up his nominee, to be announced in the coming days. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged Mr. Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the Senate floor, and Senator Lindsey Graham, who leads the Judiciary Committee, told the panel's Democratic members on Monday that he believes it is \"important that we proceed expeditiously to process any nomination made by President Trump to fill this vacancy.\" While Senate Democrats have few procedural tools at their disposal to block Republicans' efforts to move forward with the confirmation process, they are urging their GOP colleagues to wait until after the inauguration before confirming a justice to fill Ginsburg' seat. Democrats point to Republicans' decision in 2016 to block Judge Merrick Garland's confirmation to the Supreme Court after the death of Scalia, as GOP senators argued at the time the American people should have a voice in selecting the president that will fill the vacancy. But McConnell said the situation this year differs from that of 2016, as the same party now controls the White House and the Senate. Mr. Trump told reporters he is considering five women to replace Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. His top contenders are Barrett and Barbara Lagoa of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. Vice President, thank you so much for your time.\u00a0MIKE PENCE: Thank you, Norah. Welcome to the White House.\u00a0The president said he wants this done very quickly, before Election Day. Can it be done?\u00a0We believe that it can. But obviously it'll be important for us to take time to pay tribute this week to a true public servant. We join the nation in mourning the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She paved the way for women in the law.\u00a0But I know the president is anxious to move the process forward. And we fully expect to make an announcement about the president's nominee to the Supreme Court before the week is out.\u00a0You're saying that you have an agreement from the Senate majority leader to get a justice confirmed by Election Day?\u00a0President Trump believes that he has an obligation under the Constitution of the United States to put forward a nominee for the Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0There have been 29 times that there have been vacancies since George Washington through Barack Obama. In all 29 cases the president has made a nomination to the Supreme Court during an election year. And President Trump believes that it's his responsibility and his duty to do that again.\u00a0I want to ask you about one of the front runners, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She's a Catholic. She's a conservative. She's the mother of seven kids. Are you convinced that Judge Barrett would overturn Roe versus Wade?\u00a0What I'm convinced of is that Judge Barrett and the other finalists on the list will interpret the Constitution in a way that's consistent with the great tradition of Justice Antonin Scalia.\u00a0She's pro-life.\u00a0President Trump has made it clear that it's our objective to appoint pro-life jurists to our federal courts at every level.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Judge Barrett gave a speech at Notre Dame on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and she said it's very unlikely that the court will overturn Roe. So why are you convinced that Judge Barrett would restrict abortion rights further?\u00a0I just know that Judge Barrett will follow the Constitution as will all the finalists.\u00a0\u00a0The reality is that the Supreme Court in this last session actually rejected a very moderate restriction on abortion from Louisiana, a bill that would only have required doctors in abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at neighboring hospitals.\u00a0And on that case, you believe that someone like Judge Barrett would respect states' rights on that issue?\u00a0I'm proud to serve alongside the most pro-life president in American history. And I know that same standard will be met with his nominee to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court.\u00a0One week after the election, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case on the Affordable Care Act. Do you want a justice who will help strike down the Affordable Care Act?\u00a0Well, we've long believed that the individual mandate at the center of Obamacare was unconstitutional.\u00a0Twenty years ago was Bush v. Gore. It went to the Supreme Court. This year, we could have another presidential election that could go to the Supreme Court. Is that why it's so important to have President Trump's choice confirmed before Election Day?\u00a0Well, there are many issues that could go before the court.\u00a0But in the event that questions either regarding mail-in voting or regarding the outcome of the election go to the Supreme Court, it's just one more reason why we owe it to the American people, that we owe it to all the institutions of government, to ensure that we have nine justices on the Supreme Court of the United States.",

            "article_content": "Thousands of pages of witness\u00a0transcripts\u00a0released Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee provided immediate, if timeworn, fodder for unhealed partisan divisions stemming from the panel's investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference. They did little to dislodge headlines related to the rising health and economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, though President Trump seized on the transcripts' release in a morning phone interview with Fox News. He resurfaced criticisms of former Obama administration officials and allies-turned-nemeses like Jeff Sessions, who served as the Trump administration's first attorney general. Mr. Trump also foreshadowed more developments that he suggested would involve presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. \"There's more to come from what I understand, and they're going to be far greater than what you've seen so far,\" Mr. Trump said. The committee transcripts mostly retread territory made familiar by the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose two-year investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference and potential links between Moscow and the Trump campaign became regarded as the seminal probe of the matter, even as two congressional committees conducted parallel inquiries. The transcripts, 57 in total, include testimony from a spectrum of witnesses, including former Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, Obama administration officials Susan Rice, Susan Power and James Clapper, Trump campaign officials Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner, and ancillary figures like Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix and Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos. \u00a0 They include candid details from former Trump administration officials like Mr. Sessions and former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats. And they reveal the increasing levels of acrimony among the panel's Republicans and Democrats \u2013 while earlier transcripts reflect occasional camaraderie and include open-ended questioning, by December 2017 battle lines were hardened and sniping and gamesmanship were more frequent. By early 2018, some interviews \u2013 like those with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and the committee's final interview with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2013 broke down into profanity-laced confrontations over executive privilege and contempt proceedings. Below are excerpts of particularly candid or lesser-known exchanges, culled from over 6,000 pages by a CBS News team. TRUMP AND RUSSIA Several former Trump campaign aides were asked about their conversations with the president about Russia-related topics. Most acknowledged Mr. Trump's preoccupation with the press linking his campaign to Moscow, though some made light of it. \"I believe, because Russia was part of \u2014 and I am speculating \u2014 but I believe because Russia was part of the Hillary Clinton campaign's attack on then-candidate Trump, that he just planted his feet and said, 'No, no,' said Michael Caputo, a former campaign official who has recently joined the administration as a spokesman the Department of Health and Human Services. \"I believe that if Hillary Clinton had said the sky is blue, he would have said no.\" \"I don't think that was advisable,\" Caputo continued. \"I think now we know that it was \u2014 it made all of this worse. But when the then-candidate, when the president of the United States takes a position in that office, you follow or you leave,\" he said. Sam Clovis, the former national co-chair for the Trump campaign, said, \"I think he was having a lot of fun with the Putin thing.\" \"Did he ever express definitive or indefinitive favorable positions about Russia in your presence?\" asked Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell in an interview in December of 2017. \"No, I think just to pimp the media on Putin,\" Clovis responded. Coats, the former DNI, was among the earliest witnesses to appear before the committee, in June of 2017. He said the president's focus on press coverage proved at times to be a distraction. \u00a0 \"[H]e was being targeted by the media, and there was some venting, which at times made me a little bit frustrated,\" Coats said. \"I thought it was taking away from getting him the intelligence that he needed relative to making decisions and so forth.\" Asked if the president ever asked him to speak out publicly in his defense, Coats said he told the president he didn't think it would be \"appropriate\" for him to do so. \"'Mr. President, in my job, that is nothing I think \u2014 I don't think it is appropriate for me to do that,'\" Coats said he told Mr. Trump, who had called the DNI at home the night of the semifinals of the Final Four. \u00a0 \"I guess he was thinking: 'Look, you are the Director of DNl.' He was probably in his mind thinking: 'Hey, you are \u2014 if anybody knows what is going on in intelligence, from an intelligence standpoint, you must be, you say it,'\" Coats said. \"I did not think it was appropriate to do that.\"\u00a0 \"To tell you the truth,\" he continued, \"I was sitting there thinking: Here is the President of the United States sitting in an empty White House. His wife is in New York. His family is in New York. On a Saturday night, that has got to be a lonely thing to do.\" THE QUESTION OF COLLUSION Coats also told congressional investigators that then-FBI Director James Comey told him there was \"smoke but no fire\" on the question of whether evidence of a conspiracy \u2013 which often was referred to as 'collusion,' a looser, non-legal term \u2013 existed. \"There is smoke but no fire on the issue of collusion \u2026 He didn't use the word 'collusion,'\" Coats said. \"He said: 'Right now, I am only targeting \u2014 we are only looking at one person who had some role in the campaign. He said that person is Carter Page, but he said there is \u2014 there is no evidence to indicate at this point that the President had collusion with the Russians,\" he said.\u00a0 Coats himself denied having any knowledge of \"evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy\" between Russia and Donald Trump or members of his campaign \u2013 a blanket question commonly asked of witnesses by Republicans on the committee. \"I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting, conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election,\" former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified. \"That's not to say there weren't concerns about the evidence we were seeing, anecdotal evidence.\" \"I saw indications of potential coordination,\" said Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to President Obama, \"but I did not see, you know, the specific evidence of the actions of the Trump campaign.\" \"I think that's why these investigations have to get to the bottom of it,\" he said. \u00a0 THE STEELE DOSSIER A number of witnesses were asked about the contents of the so-called Steele dossier, a document of raw, unverified intelligence compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who had previously worked with the FBI. It contained a number of salacious details about the president, and caused shock waves after it was leaked to the media in 2017. After reading one of the most controversial allegations in the dossier, Representative Trey Gowdy asked Keith Schiller, who worked for years as Mr. Trump's bodyguard and had accompanied him on a trip to Russia, where the alleged actions were to have taken place, if he had \"anything to corroborate that salacious allegation in the dossier.\" \"No sir, I don't,\" Mr. Schiller responded. He later testified that, while traveling in Russia, \"someone\" suggested sending women to Mr. Trump's hotel room. \"I believe he was joking, because I immediately told him, 'Absolutely not. We don't do that. But I don't know who it was.\" Schiller said when he later told Mr. Trump about the suggestion, \"He laughed.\" \"We both laughed,\" Schiller testified. \"I told him it was immediately something that we would never do, and I just told him I shut it down immediately.\"\u00a0 Coats also described one conversation he had with the president about the dossier's salacious contents. \"I don't know why he said this to me. Maybe because it is my background, my faith background, or whatever, I don't know,\" Coats said. \"He said: 'I want to \u2014 I swear to you on the soul of my son, I had nothing to do with that prostitution. And for them to take me aside and raise that issue and then have it leaked, he said, how would you like it if \u2014 how do you go home and talk to your wife when it is plastered all over the place that you were using prostitutes in Russia, and you are having your family hear that and having your son hear that?'\" \"H was just really, really impacted,\" Coats said. In an exchange that is lightly redacted, Mr. Clapper was asked whether the intelligence community attempted to validate any of the sources, subsources or contents of the dossier, which was included in an annex to the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment of Russia's 2016 interference. \"Yeah,\" Clapper said of including the document as an annex, \"And the reason we handled it that way was precisely because we could not corroborate [REDACTED].\" After another partially redacted exchange, he continued, \"The Intelligence Community at large didn't take that on. That would be a responsibility of, if anyone, would be the FBI.\" MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER Clapper also described some of his own interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who briefly served as president Trump's national security adviser before resigning after information emerged that he had lied to the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The Department of Justice dropped its charges against Flynn on the same day the committee's transcripts were released. \"I do think the Russians, even during the time he served as director of [the Defense Intelligence Agency], were wooing him,\" Clapper testified. \"I was wooed by the Russians when I was director of DIA in the early nineties.\" \"[H]e was very big on engaging with the GRU,\" an arm of Russia's military intelligence, Clapper said. \"He visited there and had the GRU chief visit him. I did the same thing,\" he said. \"And I tried to impart some fatherly advice to Mike Flynn when he was engaging with them, because I said, you know, my own experience when I was the director of DIA.\" Jared Kushner, who worked on the Trump campaign and transition team before becoming a senior White House adviser, described his conversations with Kislyak and Flynn during a December 1, 2016 meeting. Kushner said Kislyak wanted to discuss the U.S. position on Syria. \"We did not have a fully formed view on what we wanted to do in Syria,\" Kushner said. \"So, in order to collect different opinions, so that we can try to come up with a strategy to present to the President at some point in time, they offered to have their generals give their perspective to General Flynn. That's when he said: 'Look, I would like you to hear their side of what they think' \u2026 They asked if we had a secure way to do that, to which General Flynn said no.\" After agreeing the generals were unlikely to come in person to the U.S., Kushner said, \"I'm a business guy. I said: \"Look, if you want to give us information, if you have a way to get information, then let us just use the way you get the information.'\" \"And [Kislyak] says: 'Well, we shouldn't do that in our Embassy.' And we said: 'No problem.'\" Susan Rice, Flynn's functional predecessor in the Obama administration, testified that when she read the press reports about the communications between Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak, \"I was horrified.\" \"It's inconceivable to me that someone associated with an incoming administration would seek to have a private channel with an adversarial government designed to be hidden from the government that he or she was going to represent in a few weeks' time,\" she said. \"That approach, if it's true, would suggest to me that one places more confidence in our principal adversary's interests and communications than they do in our own,\" she said. \"And it is deeply troubling to me that anybody responsible in any way, shape, or form for U.S. policy would privilege the Russians over the United States Government.\" Contributors: Bryce Klehm, John Nolen,Corey Rangel,Brandi Kellam, Julia Boccagno, Grace Segers, Katie Watson, Paulina Smolinski, Mary Walsh, Maggie Dore, Amber Ali, Nicole Sganga, Julia Kimani Burnham, Allyson Ross Taylor, Tim Perry, Carrie Rabin, Zak Hudak, Arianna Freeman, Amber Ali, Maggie Dore, Leslie Frazier, Nancy Cordes",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 As President-elect Joe Biden lays the groundwork for his transition to the presidency, President Trump still refuses to acknowledge his defeat and is instead looking to the courts to rescue his chances for a second term in the White House, though in most cases unsuccessfully.  Since Election Day, the number of lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and Republican voters in an effort to halt the certification of election results has swelled to more than a dozen, with the legal battles focused on a handful of key battleground states where Mr. Trump lost. The president continues to claim the cases provide him a pathway to victory over Mr. Biden, but they involve too few ballots for him to close the president-elect's\u00a05.5 million-vote lead\u00a0or change the outcome of a state's race. Mr. Biden secured 306 electoral votes to Mr. Trump's 232.  Harvard Law School professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos told CBSN in an interview Monday, \"There have been something like 30 or 40 of these lawsuits filed in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and so on. To this point, dozens of defeats have piled up for the Trump campaign.\" On Monday, four different cases brought by voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia who sought to exclude some counties from being included in state certification of the election were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs. All four voter groups were represented by conservative elections lawyer James Bopp, Jr., who declined to say why the cases were dismissed. He told the Detroit Free Press in an email, \"Sorry because of atty. client privilege and because I do not telegraph my next moves, I cannot comment.\" The cases were all dismissed without prejudice, so they may be revised and refiled.  The increasingly steep climb to victory hasn't stopped Mr. Trump from making unsubstantiated assertions\u00a0that he won the election or claiming it was rigged against him, despite the absence of any evidence to support his allegations. Instead, the president has beefed up his legal team, spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani, and suggested more lawsuits are coming.  Here is a look at the current legal fights being waged by the president and Republicans in the courts, and where they each stand. In re: enforcement of election laws, Superior Court of Chatham County The Trump campaign alleged the proper chain of custody for absentee ballots was not followed and asked the court to order ballots received after the state's Election Day deadline to be collected and separated, and stop the counting of absentee ballots  Result: Judge James Bass\u00a0dismissed the lawsuit due to lack of evidence that the ballots were received after the Election Day deadline. L. Lin Wood v. Raffensperger, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia The lawsuit brought by Atlanta attorney L. Lin Wood\u00a0challenges the inclusion of absentee ballots in Georgia and seeks an order prohibiting the state from certifying the results of the general election and certifying the results that include the tabulation of absentee ballots.  Result:\u00a0Judge Steven Grimberg, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, denied the request to block certification of election results, saying during a hearing Thursday that to do so \"at literally the 11th hour would breed confusion and potential disenfranchisement that I find has no basis in fact or in law.\" Brooks v. Mahoney, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia The case brought by four voters\u00a0sought to exclude from the state's certification the election results from eight counties, arguing that ballots in those counties were illegally cast and should be invalidated.  Result: The four voters\u00a0voluntarily dismissed the case Monday. Johnson v. Benson, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan Two Michigan voters\u00a0asked the court to block the state from certifying the election results and declaring winners in the general election until an independent audit is performed. They requested a special master be appointed to investigate all claims of voter fraud in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, and certify the legality of all absentee ballots cast.  Result:\u00a0The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit. Bally v. Whitmer, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan Four voters in Michigan claimed\u00a0illegal votes were cast in the general election in Wayne, Washtenaw and Ingham Counties, which would require the results in those counties to be invalidated. The voters asked the court to exclude the results from those three counties from the state's certification.  Result: The four voters voluntarily dismissed their case Monday. Trump v. Benson, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan Alleging ineligible ballots were cast in the general election, the Trump campaign\u00a0asked the court to block the state and the Wayne County canvassing boards from certifying its election results.  Result: The Trump campaign voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit. Trump v. Benson, Michigan Court of Claims The Trump campaign and a Republican election challenger claimed absentee voter counting boards were being conducted without inspectors from each party present. The campaign asked the court to stop the counting and processing of absentee ballots until election inspectors from each party were present.  Result: Judge Cynthia Stephens denied the Trump campaign's request to halt the ballot-counting process. Costantino v. Detroit, Wayne County Circuit Court Two Michigan voters alleged there were numerous instances of fraud and misconduct in Wayne County and asked the court to block the certification of Michigan's election results pending an investigation. They also called for an independent audit of the general election and asked the judge to void the results of the November 3 election and order a new election be held.  Result: Judge Timothy Kenny raised issues with affidavits that allege fraud, writing in an order Friday the election challengers who claimed misconduct did not have a full understanding of the absent ballot tabulation process. Their interpretation of events, he said, \"is incorrect and not credible.\" As a result, Kenny denied their requests. The plaintiffs asked the Michigan Court of Appeals to review the order. On Monday, a Michigan Court of Appeals judge denied the request for review \"for failure to persuade the Court of the existence of manifest error requiring reversal and warranting peremptory relief without argument or formal submission.\" Stokke v. Cegavske, U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada A Nevada voter, two congressional candidates and a poll observer claimed that in Clark County, there were lax procedures for authenticating ballots and ineligible people were voting. The group, with the backing of the Trump campaign, asked the judge to order the county to stop using its signature-verification software system.  Result: A federal judge denied their request. Law v. Whitmer, First Judicial District Court\u00a0 Filed November 17 by the Trump campaign on behalf of six Nevada residents who are candidates for presidential electors for Mr. Trump, the lawsuit claims there were \"substantial irregularities, improprieties and fraud\" in the general election, including as a result of Clark County's use of signature verification voting machines at issue in the other lawsuit in federal court. The Trump campaign also claims Clark County failed to grant \"meaningful observation opportunities\" to the public for the processing of mail-in ballots. The Republicans are asking the court to either declare Mr. Trump the winner of the election in Nevada or block the state from certifying electors. Result: Pending Trump v. Boockvar, U.S. District Court for Middle District of Pennsylvania An\u00a0amended complaint\u00a0from the Trump campaign drops claims it was denied meaningful access to observe and monitor the electoral process through its poll watchers, but alleges disparate treatment of mail-in voters among different counties, where in blue counties they had opportunities to fix their ballots. The campaign estimates more than 680,000 ballots were processed in two Pennsylvania counties, Allegheny and Philadelphia, \"when no observation was allowed\" and is seeking to block Boockvar from certifying the results of the election.  During a hearing Tuesday, Rudy Giuliani, arguing on behalf of the Trump campaign, made sweeping claims about mail-in voting, claiming \"widespread, nationwide voter fraud, of which this is a part.\" Mark Aronchick, who argued on behalf of some county election boards, lambasted Giuliani, calling his arguments \"disgraceful.\" Result:\u00a0The campaign\u00a0filed a second amended complaint\u00a0\"to restore claims which were inadvertently deleted from their amended complaint, and to add claims based on newly learned facts,\" Mr. Trump's lawyers said in a filing with the court. The brief filed on November 21 rehashed claims the campaign appeared to abandon earlier in the week. \u00a0 U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann granted a request from Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar to dismiss the lawsuit that alleged Republicans had been unconstitutionally disadvantaged because certain counties permitted voters to cure their mail ballots.\u00a0 Guiliani said late Saturday night that the campaign plans to appeal. \u00a0 Trump and RNC v. Boockvar, Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania At issue in the dispute is a deadline, extended by the secretary of state, for mail-in voters to verify proof of identification. The Trump campaign sought to block counties from allowing mail-in voters from providing missing proof of identification for ballots received between November 4 and November 6, which were segregated by elections officials as part of another pending dispute.  Result: Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt\u00a0blocked\u00a0counties from counting segregated ballots in their official tallies. Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Boockvar, U.S. Supreme Court Republicans asked the Supreme Court to review a ruling from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that allowed election officials to receive and count ballots received up to three days after Election Day if they were postmarked by November 3. The Trump campaign and Pennsylvania Republicans believe those ballots, which are being segregated by counties, should be invalidated.  Result: The Supreme Court has not yet taken action in the case, Justice Samuel Alito ordered counties to segregate late-arriving ballots and count them separately in response to an emergency request from Republicans. Bognet v. Boockvar, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals In a similar dispute to the challenge before the Supreme Court, four registered voters and a congressional candidate filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the extended deadline for mail-in ballots to be returned and counted, alleging the Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Constitution by allowing the late-arriving ballots to be counted. They asked the court to block the county boards of elections from counting ballots received during the deadline extension period.  Result: The 3rd Circuit ruled the individual plaintiffs lack legal standing to challenge the extended deadline. Trump v. Montgomery County Board of Elections, Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County The Trump campaign is seeking to toss out roughly 600 mail-in ballots and asked the state court to\u00a0reverse a decision by the Montgomery County elections board denying their objection to counting mail-in ballots for which outer declaration envelopes were missing information.  Result:\u00a0Judge Richard Haaz\u00a0denied\u00a0the Trump campaign's request to review the board's decision and toss out ballots. Trump v. Bucks County Board of Elections, Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County As in Montgomery County, the Trump campaign asked the court to\u00a0review a decision by the county elections board denying their objection to the counting of certain ballots that allegedly suffered from deficiencies. The campaign is seeking to toss out 2,175 ballots with missing information, as well as another 76 either with unsealed privacy envelopes or with markings.  Result:\u00a0A hearing has been scheduled. Pirkle v. Wolf, U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania Four Pennsylvania voters attempted to\u00a0exclude presidential election results from Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware and Allegheny Counties, and block state officials from certifying the election results, alleging illegal votes were cast in those counties.  Result:\u00a0The voters who brought the case voluntarily dismissed it\u00a0Monday. In re: Canvass of Absentee and Mail-In Ballots of November 3, 2020 General Election, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County The Trump campaign sought a review of a decision by the Philadelphia County Board of Elections to count five different categories of mail-in ballots. The Trump campaign wanted the court to invalidate 8,329 ballots because the voter failed to include certain handwritten information on the ballot-return envelope.  Result: The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas ruled against the Trump campaign, but the campaign appealed to the Commonwealth Court. Now, the Philadelphia Board of Elections is asking for the dispute to be transferred to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In re. Canvassing Observation, Pennsylvania Supreme Court The dispute brought by the Trump campaign involves the Philadelphia County Board of Elections' pre-canvassing and canvassing of mail-in and absentee ballots at the Philadelphia Convention Center. The Trump campaign challenged the location where its election observers could watch the canvassing process, arguing they were too far to see individual markings on secrecy envelopes or determine whether they were properly completed. Result: The trial court denied the Trump campaign's request for the county board to modify its work area for closer observation of the ongoing ballot canvassing, but Judge Christine Fizzano Cannon of the Commonwealth Court sided with the campaign and said observers should be allowed within 6 feet of the canvassing process. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, ruled 5-2 Tuesday against the Trump campaign, finding the board's regulations governing where observers could stand during the pre-canvassing and canvassing process were \"reasonable in that they allowed candidate representatives to observe the board conducting its activities\" as dictated by state election code. Langenhorst v. Pecore, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin Three Wisconsin voters claimed\u00a0illegal votes were cast in Milwaukee, Dane and Menominee Counties and asked for results from those counties to be excluded in the state's certification.  Result: The GOP voters voluntarily dropped the case Monday.  Adam Brewster contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "Full text of Kamala Harris' remarks below. In her speech formally accepting the Democratic vice presidential nomination, Senator Kamala Harris emphasized family values and party unity in her speech before the convention. She used her speech to introduce herself to the country, while also showing how she might balance Joe Biden on the presidential ticket. Harris, the first Black vice presidential candidate and South Asian vice presidential candidate and only the third female vice presidential candidate, praised women activists of the past as founders of the country. \"The paved the way for the trail-blazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,\" Harris said, mentioning women such as Mary Church Terrell and Shirley Chisholm. \"We're not often taught their stories, but as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.\" She also spoke about the influence of her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was active in the civil rights movement in the San Francisco area in the 1960s. \"She raised us to be proud, strong Black women, and she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage,\" Harris said of Gopalan. \"My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning.\" \"I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. I do so committed to the values she taught me,\" Harris said. \"To the word that teaches me to walk by faith and not by sight. And to a vision cast by generations of Americans \u2014 one that Joe Biden shares.\" She also contrasted Biden's governing style with Mr. Trump's \"failure of leadership,\" signaling a willingness to take on the role of attack dog on the campaign trail. Harris portrayed Biden's vision for the nation and for the future as one of hope and one which embraces all, rather than the more divisive approach taken by Mr. Trump. Biden's is \"a vision of our nation as a beloved community \u2014 where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love,\" Harris said. \"Today, that country feels distant. Donald Trump's failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.\" Mr. Trump's \"incompetence\" and \"callousness\" in his response to the issues facing the country falls short of what is needed to face this moment, Harris argued. She also brought up structural racism, which has spawned nationwide protests and which she said was at the root of inequities in income, health care, and criminal justice. \"Let's be clear: there is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work. For George Floyd, for Breonna Taylor, for the lives of too many others to name,\" Harris said, referencing Black Americans recently killed by police officers. \"We can do better and deserve so much more. We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work,\" Harris said. \"A president who will bring all of us together \u2014 Black, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenous \u2014 to achieve the future we collectively want.\" Like others before her, she also reminded voters of Biden's ability to empathize with the struggles of Americans, compared to Mr. Trump. \"Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons. Joe will be a president who turns our challenges into purpose,\" Harris said. \"Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind. One in which we all can see ourselves.\" She encouraged voters to turn out for Biden, saying that \"when we vote, we expand access to health care, expand access to the ballot box, and ensure that more working families can make a decent living.\" \"In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We're all in this fight. You, me, and Joe \u2014 together,\" Harris said. \"So, let's fight with conviction. Let's fight with hope. Let's fight with confidence in ourselves, and a commitment to each other. To the America we know is possible, the America we love.\" Greetings America. It is truly an honor to be speaking with you. That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me. Women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred.\u00a0 Without fanfare or recognition, they organized, testified, rallied, marched, and fought\u2014not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. These women and the generations that followed worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed. They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on. Women like Mary Church Terrell and Mary McCleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm. We're not often taught their stories. But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders. There's another woman, whose name isn't known, whose story isn't shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on. And that's my mother\u2014Shyamala Gopalan Harris . She came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California Berkeley, she met my father, Donald Harris \u2014who had come from Jamaica to study economics. They fell in love in that most American way\u2014while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I got a stroller's-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called \"good trouble.\" When I was 5, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work\u2014packing lunches before we woke up\u2014 and paying bills after we went to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen table\u2014and shuttling us to church for choir practice. She made it look easy, though I know it never was. My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage. She taught us to put family first\u2014the family you're born into and the family you choose. Family, is my husband Doug, who I met on a blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren. Family is my uncles, my aunts\u2014my chitthis. Family is Mrs. Shelton\u2014my second mother who lived two doors down and helped raise me. Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha...our Divine 9\u2026and my HBCU brothers and sisters. Family is the friends I turned to when my mother\u2014the most important person in my life\u2014passed away from cancer. And even as she taught us to keep our family at the center of our world, she also pushed us to see a world beyond ourselves. She taught us to be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people. To believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is a shared responsibility. That led me to become a lawyer, a District Attorney, Attorney General, and a United States Senator. And at every step of the way, I've been guided by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom: Kamala Harris , For the People. I've fought for children, and survivors of sexual assault. I've fought against transnational gangs. I took on the biggest banks, and helped take down one of the biggest for-profit colleges. I know a predator when I see one.\u00a0 My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she's looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman\u2014all of five feet tall\u2014who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America. I do so, committed to the values she taught me. To the Word that teaches me to walk by faith, and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans\u2014one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a Beloved Community\u2014where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love. A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect. A country where we look out for one another, where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges, and celebrate our triumphs\u2014together. Today... that country feels distant. Donald Trump's failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.\u00a0 If you're a parent struggling with your child's remote learning, or you're a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know that what we're doing right now isn't working. And we are a nation that's grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy. And yes, the loss of certainty. And while this virus touches us all, let's be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately. This is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism.\u00a0 Of inequities in education and technology, health care and housing, job security and transportation. The injustice in reproductive and maternal health care. In the excessive use of force by police. And in our broader criminal justice system. This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly how we see each other\u2014and how we treat each other. And let's be clear\u2014there is no vaccine for racism. We've gotta do the work. For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us. We've gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. Because, none of us are free...until all of us are free... We're at an inflection point.\u00a0 The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It's a lot.\u00a0 And here's the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more.\u00a0 We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us together\u2014Black, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenous\u2014to achieve the future we collectively want. We must elect Joe Biden.\u00a0 I knew Joe as Vice President. I knew Joe on the campaign trail. But I first got to know Joe as the father of my friend. Joe's son, Beau, and I served as Attorneys General of our states, Delaware and California. During the Great Recession, we spoke on the phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks that foreclosed on people's homes. And Beau and I would talk about his family. How, as a single father, Joe would spend 4 hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every morning with their dad. They went to sleep every night with the sound of his voice reading bedtime stories. And while they endured an unspeakable loss, these two little boys Always knew that they were deeply, unconditionally loved. And what also moved me about Joe is the work he did, as he went back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence Against Women Act\u2014and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban. Who, as Vice President, implemented The Recovery Act, which brought our country back from The Great Recession. He championed The Affordable Care Act, protecting millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. Who spent decades promoting American values and interests around the world, standing up with our allies and standing up to our adversaries. Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons.\u00a0 Joe will be a president who turns our challenges into purpose.\u00a0 Joe will bring us together to build an economy that doesn't leave anyone behind. Where a good-paying job is the floor, not the ceiling.\u00a0 Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic and make sure that we are prepared for the next one. Joe will bring us together to squarely face and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of generations. Joe and I believe that we can build that Beloved Community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind. One in which we all can see ourselves. That's the vision that our parents and grandparents fought for. The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promise\u2014for all its complexities and imperfections\u2014a promise worth fighting for. Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy. We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths. And we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. We believe that our country\u2014all of us, will stand together for a better future. We already are. We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people they've never met. We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the Poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic. And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises, but to somewhere better. There's something happening, all across the country.\u00a0 It's not about Joe or me.\u00a0 It's about you. It's about us. People of all ages and colors and creeds who are, yes, taking to the streets, and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors, and getting out the vote. And we've shown that, when we vote, we expand access to health care, expand access to the ballot box, and ensure that more working families can make a decent living. I'm inspired by a new generation of leadership. You are pushing us to realize the ideals of our nation, pushing us to live the values we share: decency and fairness, justice and love. You are the patriots who remind us that to love our country is to fight for the ideals of our country. In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We're all in this fight. You, me, and Joe\u2014together. What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege.\u00a0 So, let's fight with conviction. Let's fight with hope. Let's fight with confidence in ourselves, and a commitment to each other. To the America we know is possible. The America, we love. Years from now, this moment will have passed. And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? They will ask us, what was it like? And we will tell them. We will tell them, not just how we felt.\u00a0 We will tell them what we did.\u00a0 Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the pomp and pageantry of the opening act of the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump are complete. The cast is set as prosecutors, defenders, jurors, and judge prepare for their roles in what is only the third impeachment trial in American history. But the question of whether there will be witnesses in the trial and who the witnesses might be will likely be delayed until act one is over. It was an unusually subdued Senate as the gravity of a presidential impeachment trial set in last week. MAN: Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment. JOHN ROBERTS: Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution? MARGARET BRENNAN: Ceremony over, political posturing is well underway. House impeachment managers, the prosecutors will open their case early this week. It's a now-familiar one, charging with the President with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. JERRY NADLER: There is an overwhelming case beyond any reasonable doubt the President betrayed the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: The defense team led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow has some new recruits, including high-profile celebrity defender Alan Dershowitz and former Clinton prosecutor Ken Starr. They say the House-passed articles of impeachment are constitutionally invalid and that the effort is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the 2016 election and interfere with 2020. We'll preview the Senate trial with a top House prosecutor, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn. We'll also look into the impact of the new revelations from Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. He is under indictment for campaign finance charges but is implicating the President directly in efforts to push Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden. LEV PARNAS: President Trump knew exactly what was going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Then former White House Economic Adviser Gary Cohn joins us for a rare interview, weighing in on President Trump's economic record and what 2020 Democrats should be talking about when it comes to the economy. All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with House impeachment manager and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. He joins us from New York. Mister Chairman, good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER (D-New York/@RepJerryNadler/Judiciary Committee Chairman): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the-- the White House legal team sent their response last night to the articles of impeachment: abuse of power, obstruction of justice. They, on the first, argue that there was no violation of any law. And on the second point, they argue that the President had the right to refuse to produce documents and witnesses due to executive privilege. How are you going to prosecute this case? REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, both of those statements are arrant nonsense. There is ample evidence, overwhelming evidence. Any jury would convict in-- in three minutes flat that the President betrayed his country by breaking the law. The GAO, the General Accountability Office, just came out this week and pointed out that withholding money from-- from Ukraine that Congress had appropriated is against the law. But we didn't need them to tell us that. And the reason he did that was in order to extort a foreign government to-- to-- to smear his political opponents for his personal benefits and to help try to rig the 2020 election as he worked with the Russians to try to rig the 2016 election. Same pattern. So, there is no question that working with a foreign-- working with a foreign power, trying to extort a foreign power to interfere in our election is about as bad as-- as you can imagine. The main fear the framers of the Constitution had, why they put the impeachment clause in the Constitution, was they were afraid of foreign interference in-- in our domestic affairs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: The-- the second thing they say that he broke no law is absurd. Abuse of power is the central reason for the impeachment clause in the Constitution. It's all over the Federalist Papers. It's all over the debates in the constitutional convention. There is no question about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: And the evidence is overwhelming. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- I-- I want to ask-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: And the-- and the last thing they said is-- is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --is that-- is that the President is entitled to withhold documents. No, he's not. The House of Representatives has the impeachment power under the Constitution. And that includes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --and the Supreme Court ruled that in the Nixon case that he has every-- that we must demand documents. He-- he can't withhold all the evidence and by the way-- and then say there's not enough evidence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, on the question of witnesses, from what we are hearing from Senate Republicans, there will, eventually, be a vote on whether or not to hear from witnesses. Not a commitment upfront, but an agreement to talk about it and vote on it later. Is there any circumstance in which Democrats would consider, for reciprocity, having Hunter Biden come and testify? REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: You know the question of witnesses in any trial, in any trial, all relevant witnesses must be heard. Whether if-- if you're accused of robbing a bank, test-- testimony that I saw him rob the bank or he was somewhere else, he couldn't have robbed the bank, is admissible. It's not negotiable whether you have witnesses. And this whole controversy about whether there should be witnesses is just-- is really a question of, does the Senate want to have a fair trial or do they-- or are they part of the cover up of the President? Any Republican senator who says there should be no witnesses or even that witnesses should be negotiated is part of the cover up. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying no way would Hunter Biden ever be called to testify? REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, I'm saying that Hunter Biden has no knowledge of the accusations against the President. Did the President, as we said-- as the evidence shows that he did, betray his country-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --by conspiring with a foreign country to-- to try to rig the election? Hunter Biden has nothing to say about that. They're-- they're asking for Hunter Biden is just more of a smear of Hunter Biden that the President is trying to get the Ukraine to do. But the fact of the matter is, let the chief justice rule on-- on-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --the chief justice in the first instance rules on evidence. The Senate can overrule him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: But no chief justice would-- would-- would think of-- of admitting evidence that-- that it is not relevant-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: No trial judge would in any trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about evidence because Lev Parnas, the business associate of Rudy Giuliani, some of the documents that he turned over were included in the briefs submitted by Democrats just last night. Are-- many Republicans say-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --shouldn't be admissible at all. Do Democrats want to hear him testify? And given his legal troubles, given his ties to Russian oligarchs, why do you think he is credible? REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, he seems to be credible because everything he says corroborates things we knew. New documents that-- that he has brought out corrob-- from the time, corroborate what he was saying. But the-- the main credit, the main thing is all relevant evidence should be admitted. And the President has engaged in a-- in a concerted attempt-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --to deny all evidence. Everyone who testified defied the President testifying. I mean Mike Pompeo ought to testify. John Bolton ought to testify. What is the President hiding? The President says don't let these people testify. If they were-- if they had exculpatory evidence, he would be saying let them testify. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, the White House argues that it sets a dangerous precedent for future Presidents. But I want to ask you about-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: There is no precedent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to ask you about-- REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: That is-- that is-- that is nonsense. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the President's legal team or at least some lawyers who are going to be speaking on behalf of the President, Alan Dershowitz among them, Ken Starr also added as someone who is going to be speaking before the Senate. What do you think of their additions to the team? What does that suggest to you as someone who will be prosecuting? REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: I am not going to comment on their witnesses, except that Ken Starr thinks that-- apparently, thinks that, asking a foreign government to involve itself in our elections is okay. But the President twenty years ago talking about a private sexual affair, now that's impeachable. I mean he's-- he's-- it's ridiculous. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Alan Dershowitz says it's not a constitutional criteria for impeachment, abuse of power. It doesn't meet that standard. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Well, I was surprised to see Alan Dershowitz say that. That's simply ignorance. If you read all the history of impeachments in the country, if you read the Federalist Papers, if you read the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: --consti-- the-- the Constitutional Convention debates from the 1780s, if you read the majority staff report of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974, there's no question about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Okay. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: It's ridiculous. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Chairman, we'll be watching. Thank you very much for your time this morning. We now go to a senator who was part of a small group of Republicans invited to discuss impeachment trial strategy with Leader McConnell. That's Texas Senator John Cornyn, who joins us now from Austin. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas/@JohnCornyn): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: What can you expect to see this week? How long will this process take? Will there be a motion to dismiss or are we charging ahead with this trial? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, we'll start with the introduction of the resolution that will guide the schedule on Tuesday and in the Clinton impeachment that was adopted by a hundred Senators. Here, unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are probably not going to participate, but it is-- fifty-three senators, I believe, will embrace, essentially, the same rules of the road that applied to the Clinton impeachment trial, deferring the decision about additional witnesses until after both sides have had a chance to make their presentation and senators have a chance to ask questions. And so, we'll be sitting there in our chairs, about probably on the order of six hours a day starting at 1:00 PM on east-- Eastern Time and then six days a week. So this is going to be, I think, kind of a grueling exercise but also one that will be public. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you say there will be at some point a decision on and potentially a vote on whether to allow witnesses. You're in leadership. SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, I would-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do Republicans have the numbers to block that vote from actually approving witnesses to be heard? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, if I can make a distinction, Margaret, the-- the House heard testimony from seventeen witnesses, more than a hundred hours of testimony. All of that will be available to the impeachment managers to present their case to the Senate. And then after they are through, then if the senators, fifty-one senators, want to hear more then-- then we can vote to subpoena those witnesses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, House Democrats argue not all the facts have been revealed. That's why they are arguing for new witnesses and new evidence to be introduced. I know you've said you're open to hearing from former National Security Adviser John Bolton. Does that mean that the rest of Republican leadership is open to issuing a subpoena to compel him? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, I find it curious that Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary Committee called this a rock solid case. But if the House isn't prepared to go forward with the evidence that they produced in the impeachment inquiry, maybe they ought to withdraw the articles of impeachment and-- and start over again. This isn't the Senate's responsibility to make the case. This is the House's responsibility under the Constitution. The Senate's supposed to decide the case sitting as a court of impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: So, this is really on the House to make that decision. They can continue to process additional witnesses in the House. They could even vote on additional articles of impeachment. But this to me seems to undermine or indicate that they're getting cold feet or have a lack of confidence in what they've done so far. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but, yet, you say the door is still open to holding a vote to hear from witnesses. I mean you were Mitch McConnell's-- SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --number two for-- for some time. Do you think he can control the caucus to prevent a vote to approve witnesses? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, this is a very serious matter. Obviously, this is the third time in American history where we have had a trial on impeachment charges. Unfortunately, this seems to be more of a political or policy differences than-- than actually a high crime and misdemeanor as the Constitution requires. So, I think we-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- so you reject-- SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: -- we're going to proceed with caution. MARGARET BRENNAN: You reject that government watchdog report, the GAO report, that does say there was a violation of the law? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Certainly not a crime and something that no one had ever dreamed in the past would have been-- risen to the level of impeachment. This is one of the basic problems with the House's case-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't it central-- SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: --is the Constitution-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to that question of the President withholding aid for personal gain, which is the allegation? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, it's-- it is-- he has been charged with abuse of power, which is not treason, which is not bribery, which is not a high crime and misdemeanor. So, this is the first time in history where a President has been impeached for a non-crime for events that never occurred. Ultimately, the investigation never took place and ultimately the-- their aid was delivered. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: This is really unique, and I think every senator is going to take this very seriously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that-- that is certainly what the-- the White House is arguing. But I want to ask you about the legal brief that Democrats did submit. It included a number of things, including documents that have been revealed recently by Lev Parnas, an indicted business associate of Rudy Giuliani. Among them, a letter that says that Rudy Giuliani himself was acting with the approval and knowledge of the President when he was reaching out to the president of Ukraine. Should all of these items be admissible during trial? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, as you know, Margaret, I was a judge for thirteen years in-- in state courts and in no court in America would that kind of hearsay be admissible. But having said that, I would be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a letter from Rudy Giuliani. SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, I would be careful before crediting the veracity of somebody who is under indictment in New York, the southern district of New York, and who's trying to get leniency from the prosecutor and who has ties to Russian oligarchs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yeah, he-- SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: The Russians have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --exactly, but-- SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: --had a lot to do with our elections and disinformation campaigns, and this could be part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you certainly would have knowledge, since you're on Senate Intelligence on that. But given what you're saying are Lev Parnas' ties to Russian oligarchs, which is often shorthand for Russian mafia, doesn't it trouble you that he was working so closely with Rudy Giuliani, who is acting on the President's behalf and saying he was acting on the President's behalf? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Well, there's no question that there have been a-- a series of grifters and other hangers on that have associated themselves with the President's campaign or claimed to have special relationships with the President. But this is not the issue that the Senate's going to be deciding. We'll take the issue of evidence as it comes. If the impeachment managers want to rest their case on the credibility of somebody who's under indictment in the Southern District of New York with extensive ties to Russian oligarchs and organized crime, as you point out, then that's their choice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Congress going to investigate, should they investigate what was going on with Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch who, according to these documents released by Lev Parnas, appears to have been under surveillance? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: I'm sure that will happen. And I know the Ukrainian government has asked for some help in-- in some of this investigation. But, as you point out, I've been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee during a three-year plus investigation into the Russian active measures campaign. We know that Ukraine was plagued with corruption. We know of the ties between Ukraine and-- and Russian oligarchs, which are proxies for Vladimir Putin. And so, that's why I think we need to approach all of this with a little bit of caution and make sure we have our facts right and make sure we know about the credibility problems that some of these purported witnesses have before we take it at face value. MARGARET BRENNAN: But these text messages, are you saying there's reason not to believe that she was, indeed, being surveilled or potentially at risk? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Yeah, I just don't know the answer to that. I would say I'd-- I'd say anything is possible in this-- in this smarmy environment in Ukraine and-- and-- and-- and in Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have questions for Rudy Giuliani about any of this? SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: Not relative to the impeachment. I just, you know, that's-- that's a relationship that causes many of us to sort of scratch our heads. But I'd say he is not relevant to the articles and what the Senate's going to be asked to do, impeaching a President for the third time in American history for a non-crime over events that never occurred.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cornyn, thank you. And we'll be back in one minute with former director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Gary Cohn. He is the former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump. He's back in the private sector these days. Thank you for being here. GARY COHN (Former Director of the National Economic Council/@Gary_D_Cohn): Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the economy is going to be front and center in this election. Many economists say we're overdue for a recession. Do you think we're on the brink of one? GARY COHN: Margaret, first of all, it's great to be here. I know a lot of people have been talking about a recession. I do not see a recession on the horizon here. The U.S. economy is strong and continues to be very strong. The U.S. consumer is very strong. If you look at what's happened in the last couple of years with tax reform, we have put more disposable income in the hands of the U.S. consumer, and the U.S. consumer is out spending it. MARGARET BRENNAN: So then why is the President and his-- the man currently in the job you once held, Larry Kudlow, continuing to criticize the Fed chairman? GARY COHN: I am not worried about interest rates right now. I think our interest rate policy is in a good place, I think the consumer is in a good place, and I think the U.S. economy is in a good place. We actually have interest rates at a level right now where activity is growing. I think that, you know, fourth quarter GDP will come in around two, two and a half percent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you-- GARY COHN: --probably two and a half percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: --you differ from the President on that quibble about interest rates currently? GARY COHN: I don't think I differ from the President on the economy being strong. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GARY COHN: I think we agree completely about the economy is strong. MARGARET BRENNAN: But on interest rates. GARY COHN: Yeah, I agree that I-- I think the Fed is in a good place on interest rate policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about trade. This week the United States and China, the two largest economies in the world, signed this Phase One trade deal. There's like two hundred billion in promised purchases, but there are still like three hundred billion dollars worth of goods under tariff. So what does this actually accomplish? What-- what do you see it? GARY COHN: So, first of all, anytime the United States and China get together and sign an agreement, I think we should applaud that. I mean the mere fact that we got a ninety-plus-page agreement signed between-- between the two countries is very good relative to where we were months ago when everyone thought we were going to continue to feud with China. So we've got some trade agreement in place. The Chinese are going to buy some more goods from the United States, which has to be a good thing. But there's also, in that agreement, there are some provisions that free up trademarks and trade patents and trade secrets, which is very, very good. No, this didn't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was about intellectual property-- GARY COHN: This didn't-- I said-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and theft and all of those things? GARY COHN: This didn't address, look, this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GARY COHN: --did not address the big issue. The big issue the President and I agreed upon is that the Chinese had been stealing our intellectual property. They've been infringing on our-- our trademarks. They've been infringing on our copyrights. It has not addressed that. And we still have to continue to address that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that China is going to hold up its end of the deal and actually enact some of the reforms they say they're going to carry out? GARY COHN: I-- I think they're going to. I think they're going to open up their markets. I think the Chinese have been closed to opening up their markets for the-- for the industries that were listed in there. So I'm cautiously optimistic that the Chinese are going to start reforming and opening up their markets. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you resigned over a difference about tariffs, or at least that was a-- GARY COHN: Yeah, I don't think that's actua-- accurate but go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, then why did you resign? GARY COHN: Well, look, I-- I-- I left the administration for a variety of different reasons. And-- and the President and I had very open conversations about my policy views and his policy views. We'd accomplished a lot. And at the end of the day, he was going a different direction on some of the trade negotiations than I would have gone. I agreed fundamentally on what the issue was. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: I just didn't agree on how to solve the issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the steel and aluminum tariffs was what many thought was the impetus for your resignation? GARY COHN: Well, I didn't think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's not? GARY COHN: I didn't think the steel and aluminum tariffs were helpful to our economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to the tariffs that were used to get to the-- the negotiating table with China on this deal, or where, ultimately, they ended up with the free trade deal--the new NAFTA, so to speak, USMCA. Can the President say, look, people may not like my tactics, but I got this done? Was he ultimately right? Were you wrong? GARY COHN: They-- they can say that. I don't think we would have gotten to a different outcome. I don't think the tariffs helped us get to any different outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did it hurt the U.S.? GARY COHN: I think it has hurt the U.S. I think it's totally hurt the United States. Look, the U.S. economy is very strong, very solid. Employment growth is great. But we're missing a big component. We're missing the capital expenditures from companies in the United States. That was a key component to tax reform. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lowering the corporate tax rate is what you thought was going to get companies-- GARY COHN: Not-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to spend more? GARY COHN: --not lowering. We actually gave them expensing of CapEx. For the first five years, they get a hundred percent expense their CapEx. But the minute you turn around and put steel and aluminum tariffs on them, the minute a company is thinking about spending capital, what do you go out and buy? You go out and buy steel and aluminum. That's how you build factories. That's how you build property-- plant equipment. So, all of the sudden, the advantages that we were trying to give companies to help stimulate the economy, to build facilities, to go out and hire people, to drive wages, we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they needed to build. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the President got in his own way? GARY COHN: I'm saying the policies collided with each other. MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary Cohn, stay with us. And we will be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News plans special coverage each day of the Senate impeachment trial proceedings on the broadcast network and on our digital network CBSN, starting this coming Tuesday at 1:00 PM. As for FACE THE NATION, we'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will have more special coverage each day of the impeachment trial, but stay with us on FACE THE NATION. More of our interview with Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director under the Trump administration. Stay ahead. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with former director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn. So at this signing ceremony the President did this week with China, he said: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Wednesday): I made a lot of bankers look very good. MARGARET BRENNAN: The top six U.S. banks saved about thirty-two billion dollars because of the tax cuts that you helped craft. This is analysis, according to-- to Bloomberg News. The-- the hit on the tax law is that it is good for corporations, it's good for business. It's not good for the little guy. Why do you think this analysis is wrong? The President seems to be saying and applauding that he's helping out big banks. GARY COHN: Well, our-- our tax bill's clearly working, which is great. We have made U.S. businesses competitive again with the rest of the world. We lowered the corporate tax rate to twenty-one percent. So we now have a corporate tax rate that is competitive with the rest of the world. Yes, we lowered corporate tax rates, and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars a year to do that. But it stimulates huge economic growth. The businesses in the United States now can thrive, which means that they can grow. They can go out and hire people, which we've seen. We've seen record unemployment. We've seen record unemployment rates down to three and a half percent. We've seen wage growth. We've seen three-percent-plus wage growth. And, most importantly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You put this all on the tax law? GARY COHN: We've seen-- a lot of it has to do with tax law. It has to. We've seen higher-end wage growth at the bottom pay scale than we have at the top. So we're seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate, we're seeing that happen, and-- and that is happening in the last couple of years. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a whole debate about the contribution to the deficit. But I want to put that aside here because I want to focus in on something-- GARY COHN: Oh, please don't. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to focus in on something, though, that-- that is really resonating politically. And it is this broader argument that this country somehow is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor. And you've even had Jamie Dimon, the CEO of CEO of JPMorgan, you've had Hank Paulson, former Treasury secretary, former head of Goldman Sachs. I know you know him. They have said that they are all concerned about income inequality growing in this country. Are you concerned? GARY COHN: Of course, I'm concerned. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you-- but you don't-- GARY COHN: We-- we're all concerned-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --think in any way that there have been contributions to that through the tax law you helped write? GARY COHN: I-- I think there have been contributions for the positive. I think if you look at the data, you'll see that we have grown wages-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: --at the bottom end of the pay cy-- cycle-- scale, I'm sorry, pay cy-- scale faster than we've grown them at the top. That's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to attract more jobs back to the United States, put more people to work. And that's what we're seeing happening. MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael Bloomberg says about this tax law, \"Nearly all the money goes to people like me who don't need it.\" This is a guy who knows Wall Street, who is a billionaire. He is saying that the tax law is-- is only advantaging people like him. GARY COHN: I'd love to know how it's advantaging him. I'd-- I'd love to see that because at the end of the day, we have lowered rates. I'll agree that we've lowered rates. We have broadened the base, meaning that we make more of your income taxable. That's basic tax policy. Lower rates, broaden base, meaning you get rid of more of the loopholes that people have used to deduct from their income what they pay taxes on. We got rid of a lot of the loopholes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: So people are having to pay more taxes-- they are having to pay tax on more of their income. Yes, they are paying it at a little lower rate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to endorse Michael Bloomberg, whose board I believe you sit on-- GARY COHN: I do not, I do not-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --as part of one of his Bloomberg entities? GARY COHN: I sit on one of his-- his emerging market boards. I guess it's a board. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be voting for him? GARY COHN: It does not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Two of the candidates who are also vying for the Democratic nomination--Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren--constantly come back to this idea of income inequality. They have proposed taxes on billionaires, taxes on financial transactions--Elizabeth Warren has, specifically, referred to that. People making over fifty million dollars having an additional two-percent tax. What would the impact of those policies be from your perspective? GARY COHN: Look, our tax system in the United States is very, very progressive. We have-- over fifty percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax. So if you're going to collect more revenue, which I am not against, we have to collect more revenue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: It's going to come from the top half of workers. And, in fact, it's going to come from the top ten percent of workers. That's where-- that's where you can find the taxable income. I think that we will end up doing that. We will potentially need to do that. But these fangled plans that they are coming up with, we don't need to do things like that to collect more income from people. We have a basic tax system that works, and we can do some basic fundamental things, if we need to collect more money. The question is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: --do we need to collect more money? You know, we look at spending and we look at revenue and we don't talk about them in the same sentence. We-- we collect taxes and then we spend. And-- and Congress never thinks about how much money they have to spend. They just go spend. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: And so you wouldn't run your household like that. I wouldn't run my household like that. I would decide how much revenue I have and then how much I could spend. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're-- you're a Democrat. GARY COHN: Yes, I am. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a single Democrat that you would consider voting for? GARY COHN: There-- there-- I-- I'll consider voting for anyone. I vote on policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Even Elizabeth Warren, whose policy you just tried to-- GARY COHN: I will consider voting for anyone, I said. I didn't say I would. I said I'd consider voting for them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's evasive. GARY COHN: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: In pulling apart some of her proposals, you seem to be reflecting a lot of what Wall Street says, which is that there is deep concern over this focus on the financial community, on corporations, etcetera. GARY COHN: I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: In this environment-- GARY COHN: Look at-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --is this enough that you see some of the people you know-- GARY COHN: I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --on Wall Street continuing to vote along lines of whatever the President is putting forward, even if they don't like some of his behavior, vote for him because of what he is doing for-- GARY COHN: That's a-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --banks? GARY COHN: --that's a hypothetical question. I don't know. What I do know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't know who you're voting for? GARY COHN: --what I do know is the economy is really strong-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: --and the Democrats haven't really come up with an idea, how to help the economy get even stronger. So it's probably easier to talk about corporate greed, and talk about Wall Street, and talk about technology companies because they don't really have an answer for an economy that's growing two and a half percent with three and a half percent unemployment and three-percent wage growth. I haven't heard their answer on that, except let's tax it to death. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, as you said, you identify as a Democrat. You did have disagreements with the President on a number of things. I was there in Trump Tower the day of the Charlottesville reference--\"fine people on both sides\"--I remember your face that day and you were very public about some of your differences with the President. Will you vote for him? GARY COHN: Look, I am very supportive of the President's economic policy. I am very supportive of what he's done on deregulation. I haven't heard anyone who's come up with a better policy, yet. Now, I just don't vote on the economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GARY COHN: I vote on a lot of the social issues as well. So, you know, in many respects, I've got to balance both sides of that equation before I figure out who I am going to vote for. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're leaving the door open? GARY COHN: I'm leaving the door open. But at this point I don't have any intention not to vote for the President. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a frank guy. You're usually pretty direct. GARY COHN: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anyone around the President who can be direct with him right now? Is there anyone doing what you said you did when guiding him on some of these economic policies? GARY COHN: I don't know. I've been gone a year and a half. I-- I am sure there are people when you're talking to the President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But when-- when the President can say, look, I've gotten these tariffs that have helped me get this free trade deal with North America. These tariffs have helped me get this Phase One deal with China--doesn't that encourage the President's approach, one that you have said you have differed with him on? GARY COHN: It may encourage his approach, but he-- he's also got advisors in there that I'm sure are telling him differences. I know that there are people in there. You know, Secretary Mnuchin and I had a lot of conversations where we agreed on tariffs. And I'm sure the secretary is talking to the President about tariffs and what effect they are having and what effect they are not having. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, I want to ask you about a new book. I know you haven't read it. It's coming out, but there have been excerpts released that directly reference you, which is why-- GARY COHN: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to give you a chance to respond. He's called the President is-- is-- in this meeting accused of calling advisers \"dopes and babies\" and the like. Is the-- the description of the President and his management style mat-- matching your experience? GARY COHN: I don't know what book you're referring to. As you said I haven't read it, so I-- I-- I-- I wouldn't know. MARGARET BRENNAN: The management style of berating advisers? GARY COHN: Look, the-- the President is-- what you see on TV is exactly what you get in private with the President. The President is the same person behind closed doors as he is out in public, which is a-- which is a unique feature. You know it's-- it's not like he turns it on or turns it off when he walks outside. So you have seen everything the President has. That's exactly what you see when you're in a private meeting with him. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Gary Cohn, thank you for your time. GARY COHN: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our political panel. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our political panel for some analysis. Gerry Seib is the executive Washington editor at The Wall Street Journal, Susan Page is the Washington Bureau Chief of USA Today, Ed O'Keefe is our chief political correspondent, and Weijia Jiang covers the White House for CBS News. Welcome to the table. ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Good to see you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Gerry, the President seems to have shifted his request for what he wants out of this Senate trial or at least the Senate may not be giving him everything-- GERALD SEIB (Wall Street Journal/@GeraldFSeib): Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --he wants. What's going on behind the scenes? GERALD SEIB: I think, in the last few days, there has been a feeling that's taken hold that the White House is being conveyed to Senate Republicans that we would like to get this impeachment trial over with as fast as possible as opposed to let's stretch it out, let's have this exonerate the President. I think there is now a real fear that the longer this goes on, the greater the risk of unexpected, unpleasant surprises. And Lev Parnas, who you talked about earlier, kind of illustrated that this week. Somebody comes in out of the blue during the middle of a process, starts saying things that make Republicans very nervous. Maybe that increases the chances that Senate Republicans will vote to call witnesses. That's not where the White House wants to go. So I think you're seeing the President pressure Senate Republicans and you're seeing Senate Republicans having conversations this weekend about how can we speed this up and get to the finish line faster. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Susan, you-- you heard some of this with Senator Cornyn. I mean, he-- he is talking about the gravity of the moment. That doesn't sound like something you put on fast forward. SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): You know I thought it was remarkable what we saw over the last couple of days. We-- we've been talking about impeachment since Inauguration Day. GERALD SEIB: Mm-Hm. SUSAN PAGE: It's not a surprise that the President is being impeached, although maybe it's a surprise that it's over aid to Ukraine. But I thought that with the transmission of the articles of impeachment with the arrival of the chief justice with the senators signing the oath book that we had a sense of-- have the importance and the gravity of what is ahead. I'm not sure that's going to hold for an impeachment trial, especially with Alan Dershowitz on the-- on the President's defense team. But for at least a moment, it seemed like a different kind, a more serious exercise than it seemed before. MARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia, you spoke to Alan Dershowitz I know in your reporting. He's got his own legal problems, but he is someone the public knows well from being on television. Ken Starr, people know him from the Clinton impeachment. What is behind this-- this casting, if that's the right word, of these individuals? WEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): You know that baggage could follow them, if you believe that the company you keep says something about you. But President Trump clearly doesn't care because he really cares about the appearance of his legal team. And he thinks that Dershowitz and Starr, despite the other things that come along with them, will lend credibility to his case along with, quote, \"great television ratings,\" according to an adviser to the White House. So the President thinks that they will make for great TV to put on a show for who he believes are the real jurors in this case, not the senators, but the people watching at home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will it be great TV, Ed? I mean, this is something that is so-- so solemn, so scripted. The senators can't even speak. ED O'KEEFE: Right. And I think there's only-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Mitch McConnell planning for great TV? ED O'KEEFE: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Or is he seeing something else or not? ED O'KEEFE: He's-- he's hoping for a dignified process, and if that means bad TV, so be it. Remember, there's only going to be like four camera angles in the room. We don't get to see the jurors necessarily during this trial. So get no facial reactions from guys like Jim Inhofe or Chris Murphy. You know it's just-- it's just going to be sort of whoever is speaking and the chief justice for the most part. He'll get plenty of air time. Look, McConnell has four priorities here over the course of the next few weeks, manage the Senate and make sure it's a dignified process. But three other important things, he's got to manage the President and his expectations. He's got to manage the fact that several-- twenty-two of his colleagues are up for reelection and about seven or eight of them are in trickier contests than they'd like, and he has his own reelection back home. So he has to be seen as not only maintaining the decorum but also keeping in the back of his mind or in front of him that this could be a factor eleven months from now in elections across the country. SUSAN PAGE: You know what he's lucky with? John McCain is not in the Senate. ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. SUSAN PAGE: Can you imagine the fifth and sixth and seventh chores that McConnell would face if John McCain were still representing the state of Arizona? What does that mean others-- Lindsey Graham would do? Does that mean Mitt Romney would feel more empowered to stand up in a serious way? ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. And I would-- I would argue, too, that there could be somebody who emerges if not a McCain, some Republican that does step up and say, we do need to allow this to play out a little more. GERALD SEIB: But we should remember, though, that the-- the moment that would make for great TV to your question would be if John Bolton, the former national security adviser does, in fact, testify. That would be great TV. That would be a dramatic moment. And I think not getting to that point is a top goal of Mitch McConnell and the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: And while impeachment does not poll as a political win necessarily for Democrats, it's, apparently, helping fundraising at the RNC, Jerry. GERALD SEIB: Oh, it has. And it has since for several weeks now. And they've raised millions of dollars, and they've signed up lots of volunteers, people on the Trump team, people out in the country are-- are unhappy about this, and they're voting with their feet and their dollars right now to some extent. By the way one of the other groups that has to be worried about this, the thirty House Democrats who come from districts that Donald Trump won in 2016, and part of what the Republican machinery is doing is going after those people. They voted except for one for impeachment. Republicans would like to ensure they pay a price for that politically as well. WEIJIA JIANG: The campaign is really capitalizing this as well, too. Sources say every time there's a twist and turn in this entire process, you see that being advertised to supporters, and they say there's a spike in the money that they're bringing in every time something significant happens. And so they're not shying away from this, and-- and they're owning the fact that it's helping them financially. So we'll continue to see sort of this campaign for more money as this process goes on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there concern in the White House about Lev Parnas, Rudy Giuliani's business associate? You've heard Senator Cornyn and others say, not credible, not worth listening to. WEIJIA JIANG: There is concern, because there's a recognition among sources who are being honest that even if he's not an official witness, he's already impacting this trial. Unless senators are completely tuned out, they are absorbing what he is saying, and they are seeing what he is dropping in these document dumps. So even though the President insists that he has no idea who Parnas is, the problem is Parnas has receipts. And he-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And selfies. WEIJIA JIANG: Exactly, not one, not two, but a whole collection that tells a story of two men who know each other over the course of years, and so the President has to add to his defense, he can't just say, I don't know who he is. SUSAN PAGE: You know, I think great TV maybe, but I am not sure it matters in the substance of the trial in that there's not really a dispute over what happened. Aid got delayed, the President wanted an investigation of Joe Biden by Ukraine, now there's an argument about whether it's an impeachable offense. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SUSAN PAGE: There's an argument about the President's motives. But-- but in a way the-- the facts are-- are set, and I wonder if at the end of the day when we get to election day, does-- would this even matter? You know, this is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SUSAN PAGE: --part of the Presi-- in a way, these people have absorbed this idea already and made up their minds about whether they care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Ed, what about that and what about some of the jurors who are running for office themselves? ED O'KEEFE: Right. So four, of course, are senators running for President, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bennet who spends most of his time in New Hampshire. All of them concede this is going to be a problem for them. All of them were in-- or on the trail again this weekend, trying to button things up admitting to voters, I might not be back before caucus day, sorry about that. They'll send their spouses, they'll send surrogates. They're establishing office hours at their campaign offices across New Hampshire and Iowa for people to come meet their surrogates and ask questions. And they will find ways from Washington if need be to campaign, whether that's holding Skype sessions with voters or calling in to rallies and certainly doing television interviews, but they all understand they could be at a huge disadvantage. And if you look at the schedule in the coming days, who's spending most of their time in Iowa and New Hampshire? Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg who sit up there with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at the top especially in Iowa. So we've never seen anything like this. And it will really sort of test whether being there and the face time that voters in these early states crave is a factor or whether those four senators have done enough already to bank away goodwill and votes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Gerry, what do you make, though, of the argument that Democrats need to be campaigning on issues like health care. Speaker Pelosi says, how do you respond to what Gary Cohn laid out, which was it's hard to run against a strong economy. GERALD SEIB: Yeah. Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you turn back to the Senate? GERALD SEIB: Well, first of all, I thought it was very instructive that there was almost no discussion of-- of impeachment in the debate the Democrats had this week. They're not eager to talk about this out in the country. Second of all, I think Gary Cohn made a really good point. Where is the conversation in the Democratic primary dialogue about how to create jobs and what the role of the private sector is in creating jobs? You listen in vain. There's no discussion of that. And that's the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren effect on the field, but you wonder whether that's really resonating with the moderates in the party-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GERALD SEIB: --because they would like to hear some conversation about job creation and good wages and they're not hearing it. SUSAN PAGE: And, of course, the person talking about that is Mike Bloomberg, who's not even competing-- GERALD SEIB: Yeah. SUSAN PAGE: --in Iowa and who I think maybe-- maybe somebody we're not talking about enough in terms of the possibility he could emerge as a contender. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, thanks to all of you. We will be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: There is a lot of news on the Supreme Court beat this week, so who better to bring in for some analysis than our own chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford. Jan, it's good to have you here. You-- you know the court very well, and John Roberts, chief justice, we don't hear from him very often. He will now be at the center of the Senate impeachment trial. What do you-- I mean how is he going to the shape this? JAN CRAWFORD (CBS News Chief Legal Correspondent/@JanCBS): Well, that's the-- the thing. I mean we may not hear very much from him at all during this trial, because his role in this trial is completely different than what you think of as the role of a judge. And in a sense he doesn't really have a lot of power. The Senate sets the rules. So they have the first word. And they can overturn any of his rulings by a majority vote. So they have the last word. So John Roberts is going to be in this really kind of weird position where he may rule on some related matters or issues, but then the Senate could overrule him if it disagrees. He has been talking about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And now he's stepping into one of the most politically heated partisan environment, staying above that-- JAN CRAWFORD: Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: --is going to be tough. JAN CRAWFORD: It will be very tough. And that's why a lot of people said this is a nightmare for the chief justice, but it's also an opportunity, because it's an opportunity to-- for him to show in this hyper partisan environment of the Senate that he is above politics, that he is neutral, that he is not taking one side or the other. So he's going to go there as the face of the Supreme Court and potentially see that as an opportunity to remind the American people that judges are above politics. That is his opportunity and that is also his challenge. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to ask you about something else that seemingly was historic this week. Both Houses of the Virginia legislature voted for-- to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. JAN CRAWFORD: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, a lot of people would say, wait, isn't that already law that you have to treat men and women equally? But actually this proposal was never amended to the Constitution. You need thirty-eight states, three-fourths of the country to actually go ahead and do it. Why has that benchmark, why has this country never reached it and gone ahead and amended this in the Constitution? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, so I mean that's the great question, right? Because on the surface it seems, you know, really straightforward. Of course, women should be treated equally in the workplace. Of course, women should get the same kind of equal access that men would. And that was the way it was viewed in 1972 when Congress with the broad support, bipartisan supermajority of two-thirds approved that resolution and sent it to the states to ratify. Three-fourths of the states needed to ratify at thirty-eight states. And it gave the states a deadline of seven years to do so. Everyone thought it's going to happen. Thirty states passed it within the first year. Five more got on board pretty soon after that. And then it ground to a halt. And the reason is conservatives started kind of taking issue with certain things, including the issue of abortion. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973 that women had a constitutional right to abortion, and then it occurred to certain ad-- activists that this ERA could further enshrine abortion rights in the Constitution. So it became controversial. And there were other issues that--that activists pointed out on the right that would raise concerns potentially for women. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said something important there, a seven-year deadline. So this means it's expired. JAN CRAWFORD: Congress-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this just symbolic? JAN CRAWFORD: Potentially, yes. After this expired in 1979, Congress tried to extend it to 1982 just to give the states more time, and no states jumped at it. So it got stuck at thirty-five. Virginia now ostensibly would be the thirty-eighth state because we've had two other states recently also approve it. In the House later this month is going to take up a resolution to take out that deadline from the original amendment. But that's entirely questionable whether that's constitutional. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JAN CRAWFORD: Congress passed that in 1972 with two-thirds vote. And now to say that they're going to change it with the simple majority, the courts I think it's-- it's pretty suspect. And they're going to have a huge legal battle on that, that potentially going back to John Roberts could make its way to the Supreme Court. MARGARET BRENNAN: And on to your desk. Jan Crawford, thank you very much. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

We turn now to Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel. She joins us from Charlotte. Good morning to you.\u00a0 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR RONNA MCDANIEL: Good morning. Great to be with you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're quite busy. The RNC nomination, formally, of President Trump is scheduled for tomorrow. Will he be in Charlotte at all? Can you tell us anything about what to expect? MCDANIEL: Well, he will be in North Carolina, unlike Joe Biden, who didn't go to Wisconsin, the state where he held his convention. The president has an event planned in Asheville. He hasn't confirmed if he's going to come by Charlotte yet but we have the delegates here. MARGARET BRENNAN: The AP is reporting that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will be addressing the forum from Israel where he's on official business. This lineup, when you start hearing about cabinet members being involved- I mean, first of all, it's very unusual for a diplomat to get involved in domestic politics. But this starts to look like using taxpayer-funded federal resources for a campaign. Will taxpayers be reimbursed? MCDANIEL: I can only tell you, MARGARET, that the events that we've put forward from the RNC and the campaign are going to be paid for by the convention from- from- of the RNC and the campaign. You know, everything that we've put together has changed because of COVID. The president rightly said we're going to leave Jacksonville because we don't want to have resources taken away from a city that's dealing with a pandemic. And he brought it back to the White House, which is his residence.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: And it's being paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign, not the taxpayers. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are confirming that Pompeo's trip will be reimbursed by the campaign? MCDANIEL: I'm not confirming anything having to do with Secretary Pompeo's trip. I am just saying the programming, the staging, everything that we're doing will be paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: You will have, as you said, some in-person activity there in Charlotte. I heard you have something like 300 people gathering there for official business. How are you going to protect them all from COVID? This is a mass gathering. MCDANIEL: You know, MARGARET, I think it's really important to understand that the Democrats and Joe Biden just said we're going to shut this country down again. And that is a really elite view of America right now. Now, from a safety perspective, we tested everybody before they came to Charlotte. We have been testing people on-site. We are doing the things that are allowing people to live their lives, have a convention and do it in a healthy and safe way,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: --which most Americans are doing going back to work because they're going to the grocery store, as they're going to hospitals. This is a realistic way of opening up our country and doing it in a health- healthy and safe way. And the Democrats are saying, shut it all down. Well, that's easy for Hollywood celebrities and privileged politicians,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well,-- \u00a0but that's not good-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I think that-- MCDANIEL: for average Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the election itself\u00a0 The president has said he expects this to be one of the most fraudulent, if not the most fraudulent in history. He's against mail-in ballots, but the Republican Party in Iowa has mailed absentee ballots to voters. Politico is reporting Pennsylvania, the GOP website is promoting vote by mail, similar situation in Ohio. Why is the Republican Party promoting something that the president says he's against? MCDANIEL: I'm so glad you asked me this question, because there is a very real difference between states that have tried and true absentee processes that have been in place and have been tested and work versus states like Nevada that 90 days out from an election have completely upended their entire election protocol and put chaos into their process because they haven't tested it and it isn't certain.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But the post office said this week-- MCDANIEL: Why are they doing that?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --that they can handle the mail volume- volume. They don't have a problem. MCDANIEL: It's not about just the post office, MARGARET. It's that they're sending ballots to unverified voter rolls. I just talked to a voter this week who said she's received three ballots for a different woman at her address, a person that's never lived there. These are the types of things-- MARGARET BRENNAN: A ballot or an application for a ballot?\u00a0 MCDANIEL: An actual ballot. An actual ballot. She was in California. In Nevada and California, they aren't sending absentee request forms. They're sending live ballots, which I think is a huge problem. Getting an absentee request form-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear the Republican Party in these states is promoting mail-in voting. Is the Republican Party-- MCDANIEL: No. We are- we are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --supportive of that? MCDANIEL: --promoting people embracing the absentee processes that have been put in place, that are tried and true. And we are suing states that are trying to change their process 90 days out from an election, which is adding chaos to an election where we should have certainty.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of our data that we just got. CBS News has a Battleground Tracker out, and it's showing a big divide between how Republicans view the US response to the coronavirus and how the majority of voters see it. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say it's going well. Thirty-eight percent of all voters say it's going well by comparison. Then 57% of Republicans say the number of dead is acceptable at 170,000 people. Thirty-three percent of independents say it's acceptable, just 10% of Democrats. How could that number be acceptable? And why is there such a big divide between how Republicans see it and how the majority of people do? MCDANIEL: Well, I think that is a really unfair poll and- and of course, there is nobody in this country, there is nobody starting with the president of the United States who wants to see people pass away from this global pandemic that came here from China not being honest, from the WHO failing in their one duty, their one duty, to identify a pandemic. And they failed the global community. But let's be honest, Republicans do want- do not want to see people suffering from this pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. When you see Democrats continue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you say that a number is acceptable? You-- MCDANIEL: No, of course not, MARGARET. This is a global pandemic. Nobody wants to see somebody die from this. I have- have had friends die from this. This is not something people want. But the president's response has saved lives by shutting down travel early, which Joe Biden called xenophobic, by doing the decisive actions he did earlier-- MARGARET BRENNAN: From China, but not Europe. MCDANIEL: He did it from Europe as well, but Joe Biden didn't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Not until March. MCDANIEL: But Joe Biden didn't support that. You didn't hear him come out and say we should shut down travel from Europe. You didn't hear Democrats saying that. They have opposed this president every step of the way. In a time of crisis when we should be coming together as Americans, this should not be politicized.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: One area where Republicans also differ from voters overall is on the Black Lives Matter movement. Most voters nationwide agree with the ideas of it, while most Republicans, two-thirds of them, strongly disagree. Eight in 10 Republicans think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination. Doesn't this type of thinking hurt Republicans' chances of making gains with Black voters? MCDANIEL: Well, I think that there's a big distinction between the words \"Black lives matter\" and the movement, which has been led by people who embrace Marxism, who have said on networks, we want to burn this country down. And I think you have to separate that, because as we are seeing in the name of Black Lives Matter, these riots and these looters who really aren't affiliated with any type of peaceful protest, we all condemn what happened to George Floyd. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination? That was eight in 10 Republicans said too much attention on that issue. Not the movement, but the issue.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: You know who's given more attention to discrimination than anybody?\u00a0 This president. He's the one who passed the First Steps Act to get rid of the injustices in our criminal justice reform. This is our president who's pardoned people who were unjustly charged with crimes and sentenced to lengthy sentences disproportionately affecting the Black community. This is the president who gave more loans to HBCUs. This is the president that created economic opportunity zones. This is the president who has tackled discrimination. And he's going to continue to do so. And you're going to hear more about that next week in our convention as he talks about the policies he's put forward and how they have improved the lives of everyday Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: Thanks, MARGARET. Below is a full transcript of Ronna McDaniel's conversation with Margaret Brennan. MARGARET BRENNAN: Weija thank you. We turn now to Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel. She joins us from Charlotte. Good morning to you.\u00a0 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR RONNA MCDANIEL: Good morning. Great to be with you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're quite busy. The RNC nomination, formally, of President Trump is scheduled for tomorrow. Will he be in Charlotte at all? Can you tell us anything about what to expect? MCDANIEL: Well, he will be in North Carolina, unlike Joe Biden, who didn't go to Wisconsin, the state where he held his convention. The president has an event planned in Asheville. He hasn't confirmed if he's going to come by Charlotte yet but we have the delegates here. We are ready to nominate the president and the vice president. It is really exciting to be here in person. And the city of Charlotte has been a wonderful host to us. We're really excited. MARGARET BRENNAN: The AP is reporting that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will be addressing the forum from Israel where he's on official business. This line up, when you start hearing about cabinet members being involved- I mean, first of all, it's very unusual for a diplomat to get involved in domestic politics. But this starts to look like using taxpayer-funded federal resources for a campaign. Will taxpayers be reimbursed? MCDANIEL: I can only tell you, MARGARET, that the events that we've put forward from the RNC and the campaign are going to be paid for by the convention from- from- of the RNC and the campaign. You know, everything that we've put together has changed because of COVID. The president rightly said we're going to leave Jacksonville because we don't want to have resources taken away from a city that's dealing with a pandemic. And he brought it back to the White House, which is his residence.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: And it's being paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign, not the taxpayers. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Mike Pompeo's trip will also be paid for. I mean, is it appropriate to be doing this? MCDANIEL: It's appropriate to talk about this administration and what's happening with this administration and the policies that have made the lives better of the American people. And this convention is going to highlight that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: No but is it appropriate to use taxpayer dollars like this? MCDANIEL: We're not using taxpayer dollars to pay for our convention. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are confirming that Pompeo's trip will be reimbursed by the campaign? MCDANIEL: I'm not confirming anything having to do with Secretary Pompeo's trip. I am just saying the programming, the staging, everything that we're doing will be paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: You will have, as you said, some in-person activity there in Charlotte. I heard you have something like 300 people gathering there for official business. How are you going to protect them all from COVID? This is a mass gathering. MCDANIEL: You know, MARGARET, I think it's really important to understand that the Democrats and Joe Biden just said we're going to shut this country down again. And that is a really elite view of America right now. People cannot afford to not go to work. They can't afford to shut down forever. They really don't understand that many Americans right now are living paycheck to paycheck. And Nancy Pelosi, really interesting, this week, she brings Congress back-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you- are you testing all of them though-- MCDANIEL: No, let me finish. She-- MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --because everyday people can't get that right now. MCDANIEL: She- I'll get to that. But she brings Congress back. She brings Congress back to vote on the Postal Service and not on a stimulus package for the American people. The Democrat Party is saying we need to shut everything down. That is not tenable for many Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck. Now, from a safety perspective, we tested everybody before they came to Charlotte. We have been testing people on-site. We are doing the things that are allowing people to live their lives, have a convention and do it in a healthy and safe way,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: --which most Americans are doing going back to work because they're going to the grocery store, as they're going to hospitals. This is a realistic way of opening up our country and doing it in a health- healthy and safe way. And the Democrats are saying, shut it all down. Well, that's easy for Hollywood celebrities and privileged politicians,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well,-- \u00a0but that's not good-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I think that-- MCDANIEL: for average Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think the point on the safety protocols that you're taking is that those safety protocols aren't accessible to everyday Americans who come into the office. Not everyone can be tested like you say you are doing for everyone. So I think that's a little different. But I want to ask you something else about-- MCDANIEL: Well, you know what this president has done to ramp up testing and I've seen this with employers who have found ways to get testing. They're able to get PPE, they're able to put sanitization areas in their buildings. I mean, you have seen many companies and I see this all the time that have adjusted the way they work so employees can come back because it is just not tenable to shut down this economy forever.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: Only elite politicians and elite Hollywood celebrities think that that's a realistic solution. And the president is balancing health and safety-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. MCDANIEL: --with opening up the economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the election itself\u00a0 The president has said he expects this to be one of the most fraudulent, if not the most fraudulent in history. He's against mail-in ballots, but the Republican Party in Iowa has mailed absentee ballots to voters. Politico is reporting Pennsylvania, the GOP website is promoting vote by mail, similar situation in Ohio. Why is the Republican Party promoting something that the president says he's against? MCDANIEL: I'm so glad you asked me this question, because there is a very real difference between states that have tried and true absentee processes that have been in place and have been tested and work versus states like Nevada that 90 days out from an election have completely upended their entire election protocol and put chaos into their process because they haven't tested it and it isn't certain.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But the post office said this week-- MCDANIEL: Why are they doing that?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --that they can handle the mail volume- volume. They don't have a problem. MCDANIEL: It's not about just the post office, MARGARET. It's that they're sending ballots to unverified voter rolls. I just talked to a voter this week who said she's received three ballots for a different woman at her address, a person that's never lived there. These are the types of things-- MARGARET BRENNAN: A ballot or an application for a ballot?\u00a0 MCDANIEL: An actual ballot. An actual ballot. She was in California. In Nevada and California, they aren't sending absentee request forms. (00:06:02) They're sending live ballots, which I think is a huge problem. Getting an absentee request form-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear the Republican Party in these states is promoting mail-in voting. Is the Republican Party-- MCDANIEL: No. We are- we are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --supportive of that? MCDANIEL: --promoting people embracing the absentee processes that have been put in place, that are tried and true. And we are suing states that are trying to change their process 90 days out from an election, which is adding chaos to an election where we should have certainty. And the states like Florida that have done this for- for years and years and years, we trust their 0process. But why are states changing their whole election protocol when Dr. Fauci has said it is absolutely safe to vote in person, when you saw in Michigan just in early August, we had a primary, a million people voted in person. There has not been an uptick in COVID. So why are we perpetuating this myth that voting in person is a COVID super spreader? And why are Democrats upending all their election laws, tried and true processes that have been verified and proven to work and putting chaos into this election. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I- I want to move on. But, you know, some people feel for safety reasons, they'd like to vote by mail and don't necessarily have the option in-- MCDANIEL: Well and for safety reasons many-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --certain states to be able to do that. But I do want to ask you about some of our polling data. MCDANIEL: But you know what, MARGARET, they- they are suppressing a vote, though. They are suppressing the votes of people who feel more comfortable voting in person. Look at what they just did in New Jersey. They are stopping in-person voting. There are people who don't feel comfortable voting from- by mail. They want to vote in person. Why are you taking away that right from people who actually want to vote in person? We're not saying you can't vote absentee. The president has said absentee voting is great when it's been proven and tried and true and tested in states that have verified their process. But why are they trying to strip away people's rights to vote in person?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to-- MCDANIEL: Every voter should have that option. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of our data that we just got. CBS News has a Battleground Tracker out, and it's showing a big divide between how Republicans view the US response to the coronavirus and how the majority of voters see it. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say it's going well. Thirty-eight percent of all voters say it's going well by comparison.

And they failed the global community. But let's be honest, Republicans do want- do not want to see people suffering from this pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. When you see Democrats continue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you say that a number is acceptable? You-- MCDANIEL: No, of course not, MARGARET. This is a global pandemic. Nobody wants to see somebody die from this. I have- have had friends die from this. This is not something people want. But the president's response has saved lives by shutting down travel early, which Joe Biden called xenophobic, by doing the decisive actions he did earlier-- MARGARET BRENNAN: From China, but not Europe. MCDANIEL: He did it from Europe as well, but Joe Biden didn't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Not until March. MCDANIEL: But Joe Biden didn't support that. You didn't hear him come out and say we should shut down travel from Europe. You didn't hear Democrats saying that. They have opposed this president every step of the way. In a time of crisis when we should be coming together as Americans, this should not be politicized.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about that. MCDANIEL: And to watch their convention last week, trying to lay it at the feet of the president when you have seen Democrats, time after time, not work with him in a crisis is truly shameful.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Last question to you. \u00a0Another data point from our CBS News Battleground Tracker, one area where Republicans also differ from voters overall is on the Black Lives Matter movement. Most voters nationwide agree with the ideas of it, while most Republicans, two-thirds of them, strongly disagree. Eight in 10 Republicans think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination. Doesn't this type of thinking hurt Republicans' chances of making gains with Black voters?

And I think you have to separate that, because as we are seeing in the name of Black Lives Matter, these riots and these looters who really aren't affiliated with any type of peaceful protest, we all condemn what happened to George Floyd. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that. But to see our Democrat-run cities allow this- this violence to to go unchecked I think is deeply disturbing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination? That was eight in 10 Republicans said too much attention on that issue. Not the movement, but the issue.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: You know who's given more attention to discrimination than anybody? \u00a0This president. When he has given- when he's the one who passed the First Steps Act to get rid of the injustices in our criminal justice reform, not Obama, not Biden. They had every chance to do that. This is our president who's pardoned people who were unjustly charged with crimes and sentenced to lengthy sentences disproportionately affecting the Black community. This is the president who gave more loans to HBCUs. This is the president that created economic opportunity zones. This is the president who has tackled discrimination. And he's going to continue to do so. And you're going to hear more about that next week in our convention as he talks about the policies he's put forward and how they have improved the lives of everyday Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know it's a busy morning. Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time. MCDANIEL: Thanks, MARGARET.",

            "article_content": "As President Trump continues to insist voting should be in-person and alleges voting by mail leads to fraud, some Republican officials are moving forward with preparations for an increase in\u00a0mail-in voting, especially in upcoming primaries. It's the latest sign that while Mr. Trump might be trying to discredit the mail-in process from the bully pulpit, a growing number of voters are indicating support for such options amid\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0concerns.\u00a0 Pennsylvania's voters had to sign up to vote by mail by Tuesday in the state's June 2 primary. Vote-by-mail was the first item displayed on the state Republican Party's website, where an image of Mr. Trump looms behind the link to the ballot request form. The headline reads, \"Vote by Mail. Safe from Home.\" The vote-by-mail page itself touts the mail-in option for all registered voters and includes a message explaining \"why it's safe.\" And even while the Trump campaign has accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the election, it has promoted the absentee voting option ahead of the keystone state's primary. At the same time, the Republican Party of Florida has also pushed the use of vote-by-mail. In a recent email, the subject line read, \"Request to vote by mail,\" and it included a link to contact officials to request a mail-in ballot. \"In Florida, anyone can choose to vote-by-mail if they wish,\" the email stated. Meanwhile, Republican election officials are also urging people to vote-by-mail. Last week, the Georgia Republican secretary of state's office sent out a press release encouraging absentee ballot voting. Nevada's plan to hold an all-mail primary on June 9 was also announced by its Republican secretary of state. And in Kentucky, the Republican Secretary of State mailed all registered voters postcards explaining their options for the upcoming June 23 primary, including absentee voting by mail. He's been promoting the portal to request an absentee ballot online, as has the Kentucky Republican Party on Twitter, ahead of Tuesday's deadline. \u00a0 Read more from\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0on Republican efforts\u00a0here. JOE BIDEN Joe Biden called Mr. Trump a \"fool\" for mocking mask-wearing and said the president should be \"leading by example.\" Biden told CNN on Tuesday evening the president is leaning into \"falsely masculine\" language on the masks that reminded him of the boys in his childhood who \"played ball\" but don't like to get hit. Later in the interview, Biden criticized the president of having trouble \"controlling his own emotions.\" Biden called Mr. Trump \"erratic\" the more Mr. Trump feels he is behind the curve in polling. And on the current state of his search for a running mate, Biden said he is \"not making that commitment\" to choose a woman of color as some would hope. Biden confirmed CBS News' reporting last week that the deep background vetting checks are \"not yet\" happening but that the vetting committee has interviewed \"a lot of these people already.\" Simply put, Biden called the search \"underway.\" The Democratic-friendly AFL-CIO endorsed Biden today for president. The mega-conglomeration of unions represents more than 12 million Americans and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. CBS News first reported that Biden joined a private phone call with the union's top leadership following the endorsement where he thanked the group for their support and then briefly turned his attention to President Trump.\u00a0 Mr. Biden told the union leadership that the president has \"blown\" the pandemic response.\u00a0 He also scoffed at Mr. Trump's tweets on MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough pushing a\u00a0conspiracy theory\u00a0that blames the former Florida congressman for the death of a congressional aide in 2001.\u00a0 Biden said, \"He's doing everything in his power now, he's accusing Joe Scarborough of murder\u2026\"\u00a0 The Biden campaign is also expanding its team. Campaign officials confirmed Tuesday to\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0that Rachana Desai Martin has been hired as National Director of Voter Protection and senior legal counsel. The position will focus on voter rights, including the disenfranchisement of people of color amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Martin previously worked as chief operating officer of the Democratic National Committee and also oversaw its civic engagement and voter protection efforts. Over the long holiday weekend and after 74 days of social-distance campaigning from his Delaware home, Biden made his first public stop for Memorial Day,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, laid a flower wreath at a Service Memorial near their home. The stop was short but we got to see how Biden could return to public campaign stops this summer. There were two lines of pandemic protection for the Bidens: They both donned dark face masks and Biden's Secret Service detail, who were spotted for the first time since dispatched to him as the presumptive nominee, provide a built-in social distancing perimeter. This quick stop comes after Biden's campaign has zeroed in on Mr. Trump's golfing and as they try to move past Biden's comments on Friday questioning black voters who support Mr. Trump. \u00a0For Memorial Day,\u00a0read our story\u00a0on how Joe Biden a few times on the trail shared more about his late son Beau Biden as he explained he believes the large burn pits during Beau's service in Iraq contributed to his fatal brain cancer in 2015. Biden admitted he can't prove the connection, but ahead of the fifth anniversary of Beau's death on May 30th, our story details how Biden hopes to help the thousands of veterans who say they also have been impacted by the overseas burn pits.\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP In a series of moves, the Trump campaign has promoted senior political advisor Bill Stepien to deputy campaign manager and regional political director Stephanie Alexander to chief of staff. Campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement the new assignments would take effect immediately. \"Bill Stepien and Stephanie Alexander bring decades of experience in political campaigns and also relentless dedication to President Trump and all that he aims to accomplish for the American people,\" Parscale said. \"As we enter the most important stretch of the campaign, it is important to have seasoned and steady people on our leadership team, each with their own strengths, and each with an unwavering focus on victory. Bill and Stephanie are already respected by everyone on Team Trump and I look forward to their assistance as we lead the team toward President Trump's re-election in November.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Axios reported Stepien has worked alongside senior adviser to the president Jared Kushner crafting a new, distilled GOP platform ahead of the 2020 Republican National Convention. Prior to his campaign role as senior political adviser, Stepien served as the White House political director, where he managed Mr.\u00a0 rump's day-to-day political operations. Stepien operated as campaign manager for each of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's statewide elections, working as the Governor's deputy chief of staff between 2009 - 2013. Alexander organized the Midwestern states as regional political director for Trump Victory, the joint operation between the campaign and the Republican National Committee. \u00a0 And on what he called a \"big day for Seniors,\" the president announced Tuesday a \"breakthrough agreement\" slashing out of pocket insulin costs for Medicare recipients. The new benefit \u2014 available through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans \u2014 caps the price of various types of insulin to $35/month. The list price of insulin has nearly tripled since 2002, according to a\u00a02019 report\u00a0from a working group at the American Diabetes Association (ADA.) \"Nobody has seen anything like this for a long time,\" the president said during a White House briefing in the Rose Garden, politicizing his administration's new policy. \"Sleepy Joe can't do this.\u00a0 That I can tell you. In fact, it was his problem with Obamacare that caused part of your problem.\" The President later added of the Obama administration, \"I hope the seniors are going to remember it because Biden is the one that put us into the jam. Cause they didn't know what they were doing. They were incompetent.\"\u00a0A\u00a0series\u00a0of\u00a0recent\u00a0surveys find the president is lagging behind presumptive Democratic nominee Biden among seniors. Twitter on Tuesday added new \"fact-check\" notices to Mr. Trump's tweets on mail-in voting. The president suggested Tuesday morning that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud in multiple posts online, though he provided no evidence. \"Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending ballots to millions of people, anyone....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,\" the president tweeted in part. Twitter inserted notices beneath each post reading, \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots.\" Notices linked to a series of fact checking items with the headline \"Trump makes unsubstantiated claim that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud.\" Twitter's fact check clarified that California would send mail-in ballot only to registered voters. A spokesperson for Twitter confirmed to CBS News this is the first time the company has fact checked Mr. Trump on the platform, though it has been done for other world leaders. In March, Twitter marked one of the president's retweets as \"manipulated media,\" after Mr. Trump shared an\u00a0edited video of his political opponent Biden posted by White House deputy chief of communications Dan Scavino. Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale called the move a \"smoke screen.\" In a statement, Parscale said in part \"we always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.\" HELPING HANDS As the 2020 campaign season heads into the summer, the Biden campaign will likely seize on the opportunity to put former President Obama on the stump after he formally endorsed his former vice president in April. A former president throwing his support behind his past vice president is nothing new \u2014 President Andrew Jackson's vice president, Martin Van Buren, in 1836 received his predecessor's endorsement.\u00a0 But as Mr. Obama goes to bat for Biden, the idea that a former president plans to actively campaign for his former vice president is not always a given. And in some cases, candidates have even shied away from a predecessor's help.\u00a0 Read more about how presidents have helped \u2014 or hurt \u2014 their Vice Presidents on the campaign trail\u00a0here\u00a0from\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0Eleanor\u00a0Watson. PARTY PLANNING Mr. Trump doubled down on his threat to relocate the Republican National Convention if North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper did not issue a definitive answer on whether the Charlotte convention would be allowed full occupancy in August,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0Nicole Sganga\u00a0report. \"As you know we don't have much time,\" the pesident told reporters Tuesday afternoon. \"If we're going to spend millions of dollars on an arena, we want to be in North Carolina.\" Mr. Trump said he would like an answer from the governor's office \"within a week,\" adding, \"certainly, we have to know. Now if he can't do it, if he feels that he's not going to do it, all he has to do is tell us and then we'll have to pick another location. I will tell you a lot of locations wanted it.\" On Monday, the president tweeted \"Democrat Governor [Roy Cooper] is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena.\" \"Plans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August,\" he continued. \"They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site\u2026\" In a press conference on Tuesday, Cooper said he's \"really not surprised at anything that happens on Twitter\" and added that while its OK for political conventions to be political, the pandemic response cannot be. \"We're continuing our discussions with the RNC and [are] going to continue to put health and safety at the forefront,\" said Cooper, who added that his team has asked the RNC to present a plan laying out various options. \"\u2026We have to have options regarding how this convention is going to be run depending on where we are with the virus in August\u2026I hope that we can find some kind of reasonable accommodations \u00a0but we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of North Carolinian and that's the bottom line.\" CBS News has previously spoken to party officials as they\u00a0wrestle\u00a0with the economic and image implications of hosting traditional gatherings, as well as local business owners and leaders on\u00a0their take\u00a0of hosting conventions amid the pandemic.\u00a0 Democratic party officials have also told CBS News that they've been forced to dramatically\u00a0re-think\u00a0their convention which has already been pushed back to August. The comments have sparked responses from Republican leaders in Georgia and Florida who welcome the idea of the convention being hosted in their state and respective cities. Republican Governor Brian Kemp\u00a0joined\u00a0the conversation on Twitter Tuesday afternoon saying his state would be \"honored to safely host\" the convention. Both Florida and Georgia were two of the first states to begin re-opening amid the pandemic. In recent weeks, both the president and vice president have praised DeSantis and the state in its re-opening efforts. While Mr. Trump said in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0Monday that he would like to keep the convention in North Carolina \u2014 and has \"zero interest\" in moving the convention to Doral, Florida, the home of Mar-a-Lago, in particular \u2014 Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said during a press conference Tuesday that he welcomes the idea of hosting the convention in the Sunshine State. \"Florida would love to have the RNC. Heck, I'm a Republican, it'd be good for us to have the DNC in terms of the economic impact when you talk about major events like that,\" said DeSantis during a press conference in Miami earlier. DeSantis went on to name Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville as some of the cities with the capacity to host the gathering. \"I have not spoken with the president specifically on that but I have, we've let the folks at the White House know that we want to work with them\u2026so he knows that and I know the key people in his administration and in his campaign know that.\" GEORGE FLOYD Notable political figures have reacted to the death of George Floyd, a black man who\u00a0was killed Monday afternoon\u00a0by a Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. \u2026 (I need) water or something. Please. Please. I can't breathe, officer. \u2026 I cannot breathe. I cannot breathe,\" Floyd is heard saying in the\u00a0video, a scene that echoes the police killing of\u00a0Eric Garner\u00a0in 2012\u00a0and is reminiscent of memories from the police shooting death of Philando Castile in 2016, which took place in nearby Falcon Heights, Minnesota. Police say that Floyd was not armed, and was involved in a \"forgery in progress.\" Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis,\u00a0tweeted, \"We can't excuse summary executions in America. We just can't!\" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said, \"The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening. We will get answers and seek justice.\" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo Tuesday said at a press conference that the FBI will lead the investigation into the incident due to the possible civil rights violation. Arradondo and Minneapolis Mayor\u00a0Jacob Frey also announced that the four officers involved have been terminated following Floyd's death. In a statement, Minnesota's Senator Amy Klobuchar\u00a0said Floyd's death was \"yet another horrifying and gutwrenching instance of an African American man dying\" and called for a complete and thorough investigation. Senator Kamala Harris of California\u00a0said Floyd's death adds to a pattern of recent videos involving prejudice against black Americans. \"Here's the sad reality: what happened to George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery & Christian Cooper has gone on for generations to Black Americans. Cell phones just made it more visible. Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable,\" she Tweeted. Florida Congresswoman Val Demings \u2013 who is a former police chief \u2013\u00a0called for a \"complete investigation\" and quotes Mayor Frey's comments that \"being Black should not be a death sentence in America.\"\u00a0 VOTE-BY-MAIL Progressive groups called on the Senate to match the $3.6 billion in election assistance funding that the House passed earlier this month in the HEROES ACT in a press call on Tuesday afternoon. The groups explained these funds will be able to improve and implement vote-by-mail systems and ensure no-excuse absentee ballots ahead of the November general election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Sean Eldridge, the president of Stand Up America, also commented on the president's recent attacks on vote-by-mail. \"Trump is trying to make it more difficult for us to vote in the middle of a pandemic for what he perceives as personal political gain,\" Eldridge said. \"Trump's lies, his tweets and his baseless lawsuits are despicable attacks on our democracy.\" MUSLIM AMERICANS Tuesday is the third and final day of the 2020 Eid al-Fitr celebrations. This weekend, Muslim communities across the country resorted to new ways to celebrate the holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. The three-day holiday after a month of fasting from dawn to sunset is traditionally one that brings families and friends together for large and intimate gatherings, but this year, Muslims relied on Zoom calls, live-stream sermons and drive-through celebrations. Typically, Muslims gather at the mosque on the first morning of Eid, which was on Sunday, for prayers and a sermon. The rest of the day is spent visiting relatives, exchanging gifts \u2014 usually cash handouts referred to as \"Eidi\" \u2014 and hosting food parties. The adjustments the Muslim community had to make for this cultural and religious holiday might prove as a test run for what could happen if there is a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak that hurts the ability of Americans to gather for Thanksgiving and Christmas.\u00a0 Read more\u00a0from\u00a0Bidar\u00a0about this weekend's Eid celebrations. COVID ANALYSIS A new analysis from Pew Research Center of the data on official reports of COVID-19 deaths collected by Johns Hopkins University found that nearly a quarter of all deaths in the United States attributed to the coronavirus have been in just 12 congressional districts.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says all 12 of those congressional districts are fully or partially in New York City and are represented by Democrats in Congress. As of May 20, of the more than 92,000 Americans who lost their lives because of the coronavirus, nearly 75,000 were in Democratic congressional districts. The top 10% of congressional districts hit hardest by COVID-19 deaths account for more than half of all U.S. deaths. In terms of deaths, 41 of the top 44 hardest-hit congressional districts are represented by Democrats. These include the New York-area districts, as well as those in the Boston, Detroit and New Orleans metropolitan areas. About two-thirds, 68%, of the 44 least affected districts, the bottom 10%, are represented by Republicans in Congress. But the death rates, while highest in districts controlled by Democrats are decreasing steadily, whereas Republican-controlled districts are not experiencing the same kind of decline over time. In districts that have been hit the hardest, nearly half of the population does not identify as white. 53% of residents of these districts are white. On the flip side, districts that have the lowest coronavirus death rate, seven-in-ten residents are white. Read Pew's study here. CALIFORNIA Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that the November presidential contest \"will be a Rigged Election,\" and singled out California Governor Gavin Newsom as part of his ongoing feud with the state's vote-by-mail initiative. \"There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-in-Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,\" Mr. Trump said on Twitter.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports the president has long been a critic of vote-by-mail, an issue that Democrats have been pushing for aggressively since the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier today, at a press briefing, Newsom said there is \"no evidence\" of fraudulent activities as it relates to vote-by-mail and referenced several studies, including one from the George W. Bush administration to prove his point. The California governor spent several minutes at the end of press briefing, saying vote-by-mail is not a Republican or Democratic issue. He warned that \"we are not even through phase one of this pandemic.\" Newsom said when the next potential COVID-19 season hits it will be around election time. \"The last thing we want to do is deny you your fundamental right, hard fought right. We just had Memorial Day weekend, people literally living and dying to protect your freedom, freedom to vote,\" Newsom said. He added that there are no benefits to politicizing this issue, saying, \"I hope we can temper our comments on the other side, though I recognize we are in a political season.\" The back and forth between Trump and Newsom comes after the Republican National Committee along with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the California Republican Party, filed suit Sunday night to reverse Newsom's order to automatically send every registered voter a ballot ahead of the November presidential election. Republicans are claiming Newsom's\u00a0recent executive order\u00a0to mail every registered voter in the state a ballot is an \"illegal power grab\" that redesigns the election system. One point of argument for Republicans has been mailing ballots to inactive voters because they say it leads to fraud. \"Ballots are mailed to all registered voters. There is a category of inactive voters that I think is the focus of their attention that don't receive these ballots,\" California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an MSNBC interview on Tuesday. Now, Republicans are claiming this is a \"reversal of Newsom's executive order\" and that Padilla has promised the \"State would not send ballots to inactive voters.\" Republicans are also calling on Democrats in the state to \"clean up their active voter rolls, as five percent of voters in Imperial, Fresno, and LA counties have moved or passed away.\" Read more\u00a0here\u00a0about the lawsuit and Newsom's executive order that earlier this month made California the first state in the nation to mail voters a ballot ahead of the presidential election as a response to the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. FLORIDA A federal judge in Florida\u00a0ruled\u00a0on Sunday that a state law that prevented formerly incarcerated people with prior felony convictions from voting due to an inability to pay fees and fines was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida called the law a \"pay-to-vote system,\" adding in part that the requirement to pay fines and fees that are \"unknown and cannot be determined with diligence\" as a condition of voting is not constitutional.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that in 2018, Florida voted to pass the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons initiative \u2014 also called \"Amendment 4\" \u2014 so that most people with prior felony convictions who had served their sentences could vote. But the inability to pay unknown court fines and fees could still prevent some from enjoying their restored voting right. Florida Congresswoman and vice presidential contender Val Demings weighed in on the decision in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0on Tuesday. \"Florida voters overwhelmingly supported Amendment 4, declaring that voting is a right, not a privilege,\" tweeted Demings. \"Glad to see Judge Hinkle uphold this cherished ideal and take us one step closer to true enfranchisement.\" Florida Democratic Party chair Terrie Rizzo called the ruling a victory for American Democracy and Floridians in an emailed statement. \"The United States Constitution once again proved stronger than Trump, DeSantis and the Florida GOP's efforts to shred it.\" According to the Campaign Legal Center website, the group represented Floridians Bonnie Raysor, Diane Sherrill and Lee Hoffman in challenging the constitutionality of the law. CLC Vice President Paul Smith called the ruling \"a watershed moment in election law\" in a statement Sunday. \"States can no longer deny people access to the ballot box based on unpaid court costs and fees, nor can they condition rights restoration on restitution and fines that a person cannot afford to pay.\" GEORGIA Testing for COVID-19 has been expanded in the Atlanta, Georgia, area through \"Test & Vote\" sites at three Fulton County early voting sites. \u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports that Fulton County, the most populous county in the state of Georgia with a population of more than 1 million residents, announced the new effort Tuesday and says it will run through May 29th.\u00a0 Testing will be offered in voting facility parking lots and is provided by the Fulton County Board of Health and CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort).\u00a0 The tests are free and available to any resident without regard to their symptoms or risk factors. Fulton County residents will not have to vote to receive a test or vice versa. MICHIGAN Republicans in the Michigan Legislature filed a request on Friday asking the Michigan Supreme Court to immediately hear their case challenging Governor Gretchen Whitmer's use of emergency powers during the COVID-19 pandemic, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0Jack Turman. The request for \"emergency-bypass review\" would bring the case right to the state's highest court and skip a hearing at the appeals level after a Court of Claims judge on Thursday\u00a0ruled in favor of Whitmer's extended state of emergency. \"If ever there were a case that warranted this Court's immediate involvement, then this would be it,\" the legislature said in its filing. When Whitmer extended Michigan's state of emergency at the end of April, she said that two emergency powers laws, one from 1945 and one from 1976, gave her the authority to do that. A state of emergency gives her power to issue executive orders like her stay at home order. Judge Cynthia Diane Stephens ruled on Thursday that Whitmer was allowed to extend the state of emergency under the 1945 law, but overstepped her boundaries on the 1976 law because that law requires legislative approval to extend a state of emergency after 28 days. Judge Stephens' ruling kept the state of emergency in effect, along with the executive orders related to it. The day after the ruling, Whitmer extended Michigan's state of emergency until June 19 and her safer at home order until June 12. \u00a0Legislative Republicans are asking the Michigan Supreme Court to hold oral arguments as soon as possible. Before the Memorial Day weekend, a northern Michigan dock company owner said Whitmer's husband inquired about installing their family's boat in the water, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Detroit News. Retail businesses and restaurants and bars with limited seating in the Upper Peninsula and the greater Traverse City regions were allowed to reopen on May 22nd, but Whitmer encouraged Michiganders to \"think long and hard\" before traveling to the region. The Detroit News reported that Whitmer's husband, Marc Mallory, identified himself as Whitmer's husband and asked the company if that would speed up the process of getting their boat placed in the water. Whitmer addressed the report at a press conference, saying that her husband \"made a failed attempt at humor.\" Whitmer said, \"Knowing it wouldn't make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue.\" She continued, \"Obviously, with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn't\u2026And to be honest, I wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived. He regrets it. I wish it wouldn't have happened.\" In a statement, Michigan Republican Party chair Laura Cox said, \"Using your wife's political office to score favors is not a laughing matter.\" Michigan Rising Action, a conservative group, also seized on the report and sent out a fundraising email criticizing \"Whitmer's blatant hypocrisy.\" The fundraising email states \"it's clear that Whitmer and her family believe that there's one set of rules for them and another for the rest of us.\" NEVADA The Nevada State Democratic Party\u00a0on Tuesday announced Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will keynote their convention on June 13, the last of the early-state parties \u2014 following Democrats in\u00a0Iowa,\u00a0New Hampshire, and South Carolina \u2014 to wrap up its delegate nominating process after the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0postponed the event. Klobuchar garnered support from a mere 4.2% from Nevada caucus-goers\u00a0in February, a fraction of then-rival Senator Bernie Sanders' sweeping victory in the state that earned him nearly two dozen of Nevada's delegates, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. While some Sanders supporters have fought for influence over the convention and the state party's platform, neither Sanders nor his most prominent endorsers are scheduled to speak at the virtual event. \"Nevada will be a critical state to win in 2020 if we want to elect Joe Biden to the White House and keep our Democratic majority in the House of Representatives,\" Klobuchar said in a statement released by the party. PENNSYLVANIA About 2,000 voters in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, received mail-in ballots for the incorrect party over the past week, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Because the state holds a closed primary, Democrats and Republicans can only vote in their own party's races, but voters in the Eastern Pennsylvania county have been receiving ballots for the other party's primaries. The blunder was the result of a technology issue, said Teresa Harris, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. \u00a0\"The printer removed independent and third-party voters who can't vote in this primary, but accidentally rearranged the remaining voters and parties in its system, mixing them up,\" Harris said. \"By retracing how it happened, the printer was able to identify the voters who received the wrong ballots.\" Harris said county officials are working with the Postal Service to expedite the delivery of replacement ballots for those voters. The mistake comes two weeks after the same county said it sent faulty supplemental instructions to tens of thousands of voters. Pennsylvania elections offices are facing an unprecedented mail-in challenge in the state, with over 1.6 million residents applying for mail-in or absentee ballots, up from 84,000 in 2016.\u00a0 Montgomery County elections officials filed an emergency petition on Tuesday, asking the county Common Pleas Court to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots to a week after the state's June 2 primary election. Citing reports of voters not receiving ballots, lengthy delivery times and a design flaw in the online application that led to apartment numbers being left off hundreds of ballots sent to apartment complexes, elections officials said that the delay is necessary to ensure a fair election. \"An election that involves members of the electorate who could be deprived of their opportunity to participate because of circumstances beyond their control,\" they wrote.\u00a0 This is at least the third suit of its kind filed in Pennsylvania this year. One was struck down by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court earlier this month, and the other, filed by the the Priorities USA-backed Pennsylvania Alliance for Retired Americans, remains open. SOUTH CAROLINA CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Democratic leaders and voting rights activists weighed in on a federal court ruling Monday, that will allow South Carolina voters to vote absentee in the state's June primary without a witness signature. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, some of the 16 states that require an excuse to vote absentee, have\u00a0broadly interpreted or modified voting laws to allow all voters to vote by mail in the states' primary contests amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Adriel Cepeda Derieux, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, called the ruling a huge victory. \"The court recognized the gravity of forcing voters to needlessly risk their health to obtain a witness signature,\" said Derieux in a statement Monday. \"This ruling means voters in South Carolina can safely cast a ballot in the June primary elections in this time of COVID-19.\" Susan Dunn, legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina, called the ruling \"a critical victory for our democracy and all voters in South Carolina.\"\u00a0 Dunn continued, \"The elimination of the witness requirement protects not only those who are most vulnerable to the pandemic, it also ensures that no one will have to\u00a0 risk exposure to COVID-19 in order to exercise their fundamental right to vote in the primary elections.\" DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement Monday that the ruling \"is another critical step toward ensuring a safe, fair, and accessible election.\" He added that \"nobody should be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote\" and vowed that Democrats will fight to ensure that voters can safely make their voice heard.\" IN THE HOUSE At least two left-leaning super PACs are wading into\u00a0an already bitter GOP primary\u00a0in New Mexico's second congressional district, as Republicans decide on a nominee to challenge vulnerable freshman Democratic Congresswoman Xochitl Torres-Small. Patriot Majority PAC,\u00a0a group organized by\u00a0Democratic political strategist Craig Varoga,\u00a0has spent nearly $200,000\u00a0on ads in the race per Kantar/CMAG data. The political arm of EMILY's List\u00a0has reportedly sent mailers\u00a0to voters in the district. Though\u00a0the groups\u00a0reported their\u00a0expenditures to the FEC as opposing GOP candidates Yvette Herrell and Claire Chase, the ads paint Herrell as more loyal to President Trump than Chase \u2014 a charge Chase's campaign has denied,\u00a0calling on Republicans\u00a0to \"condemn these Pelosi allies for meddling\" in favor of a \"deeply flawed general election candidate.\" In a statement to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, Herrell said, \"Liberal Super PACs have no business getting involved in this primary and they should stop immediately.\" In New York, a new\u00a0ad\u00a0is up in the state's 15th congressional district primary in support of Democratic candidate and City Council Member Ritchie Torres. The ad, funded by a $300,000 independent expenditure by the Voter Protection Project PAC, attacks Torres' Democratic opponent Ruben Diaz Sr. for his previous pro-Trump comments and friendly relationship with the president. \"Diaz Senior supports the dangerous Trump agenda that hurts South Bronx families,\" the ad says. VPP President Matt Lieberman told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0the group was drawn to Torres' record on voting rights as a city council member, and said he has the best chance of defeating Diaz Sr. to be the nominee in the safe-Democratic district. \"A possibility that a so-called Democrat who's friends with the president could end up representing this district, when we have a far better alternative...we see a responsibility to step up,\" he said. Diaz Sr. was\u00a0recently endorsed\u00a0by the New York Police Department's Union, and trails Torres by over $800,000 in terms of cash on hand. Ten Democratic candidates are facing off in this June 23 primary, which has switched to an all-mail format.\u00a0",

This week on FACE THE NATION, coronavirus surges in the south and west with hospitalizations and deaths on the rise. Unemployment claims spike for the first time in nearly four months and President Trump looks for a reset.\u00a0As America's pastime faced its new reality, a July opening day, empty stadiums and a mask--epidemiologist tossing the first pitch. President Trump faced his own reality, a pandemic out of his control.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: He shifted messaging on multiple fronts, endorsing masks, reviving his COVID press briefings, and cancelling the GOP convention in Florida. The President even backed off his push for all schools to reopen.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In cities or states that are current hotspots, districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And as an eviction ban in extra jobless benefits expired, his administration failed to reach a deal with Senate Republicans who still need to negotiate with House Democrats on the next COVID aid package.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The Republicans are derelict in their duty.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Our guests, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Plus, we remember a lion of the Civil Rights Movement, the late Congressman John Lewis.\u00a0It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. One hundred days from the election, the country faces a bleak outlook. Over the past five days, the coronavirus killed more than a thousand Americans a day, highest number since late May. Millions of Americans are also wondering how to make ends meet. Congress allowed a six-hundred-dollar boost to unemployment insurance and a federal ban on evictions to expire. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it may take weeks to reach a deal, as Republicans have not yet presented an alternative to the three trillion-dollar rescue package that House Democrats already passed.\u00a0We begin this morning with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi, thank you for joining us.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (Speaker of the House/@SpeakerPelosi): My pleasure. Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The treasury secretary said this morning that Republicans will introduce a bill on Monday. When do you expect to begin negotiating?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, we-- we've been anxious to negotiate for two months and ten days when we put forth our proposal that does three things--honors our-- honors our heroes by supporting state and local government with the health care workers, food suppliers, teachers, teachers, teachers, transportation workers, sanitation workers and the rest. Secondly, that opens up our economy by having testing, tracing, treatment, and distancing to end this virus. And, third, to put money in the pockets of the American people. Unemployment benefits, direct payments, et cetera. These are things that the Republicans have voted for in previous COVID packages so it was nothing new. It was more--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --because more was needed. And then for them to come now, when we're right on the brink, when people are hungry in our country, children, millions of children, are food insecure. Many families who never thought they'd go to a food bank are going to food banks. And we need more money for food stamps and emergency nutrition programs. And they're resisting that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And again, that-- that they would now be trying to-- they're in disarray and that delay is causing suffering for America's families. So we have been ready for two months and ten days. I've been here all weekend hoping they had something to give us. They promised it this week. It didn't come.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Now they're saying Monday.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you stay in session until a deal is negotiated?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We can't go home without it. But it's so sad that people should have this uncertainty in their lives. At the same time as they are bolstering the stock market. And that's not a bad thing but trillions of dollars from the Fed, et cetera, to bolster the stock market--let's have a measured amount of money to bolster America's working families.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's-- specifically, on what has just expired, that-- that boost of six hundred dollars to federal unemployment. Republicans and the White House are saying that they want to keep some money going, but bring it down to about seventy percent of prior wages. Is that something you can accept?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, let-- let me just say this. The reason we had six hundred dollars was its simplicity.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And figuring out seventy percent of somebody's wages. People don't all make a salary. Maybe they do. They make wages and they sometimes have it vary. So why don't we just keep it simple? Unemployment benefits and the-- the enhancement, which is so essential right now and that's really where we are starting and-- and--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So a flat amount is what you're saying--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: It's so important to the American people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: You know, sixty percent, over sixty percent of the American people support that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. No, I understand the difficulty for states to adjust their systems to process this. But would you accept a flat amount? Something less than six hundred dollars as a boost. Is there a compromise here?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Let-- let me just say, I'm not going to have a-- with all due respect to you, Margaret, and I appreciate the opportunity to share some values that we have that, apparently, they don't share. We'll have our negotiation, but we-- how can-- these are the same people who gave a tax-- the only thing they have accomplished in the Trump administration, on their own, the only thing they accomplished was a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America. The cost of two trillion dollars to the national debt in order to give eighty-three percent of the benefits--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --to the top one percent. And they're resenting six hundred dollars for single moms to be able to put food on the table, for dads to maintain the dignity of-- of keeping their families intact, with unemployment insurance, with assistance for rent--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --with food. This is an emergency that maybe they don't understand. I don't know what they have against working families in America--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --they would keep this going so long.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I appreciate you not-- saying you don't want to negotiate in public, but for everyday Americans who-- who are waiting on this money, the amount matters. I know the argument being that this is a cliff and that people were paid to stay home. Now, they don't need to be paid to stay home. So I'm-- I'm just wondering for you, because the last time we spoke on the heels of the HEROES Act being passed back in May, you said to me at that time, we have no red lines. Has that changed? Is this a red line for you?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: That was in reference to what you said about the liability, et cetera.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I see.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: But, in fact, you don't go into a negotiation with a red line. But you do go in with your values. And if you are spending trillions of dollars to bolster the stock market, and I'm not complaining about that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --that's important to our economy. So is this. Now, mind you, we haven't even spoken about state and local. State and local government is-- supplies the-- meets the needs of the American people. Millions of people, over a million people, have already been fired from state and local government because of the cost of-- of coronavirus and the revenue lost from coronavirus. If these people get fired, they go on unemployment insurance.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So what money are you saving by ignoring the needs not only of the American people, but of state and local government? That's a whole piece of all of this that is essential to, again--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --not only meeting needs and meeting payrolls, but also growing our economy.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of the companies and even universities out there have said that they do need some kind of liability protections. Is-- are you open to a deal that includes that?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, there-- there are some suggestions that relate to academics-- to schools and the rest. We have an initiative in California to that respect, but we-- what we will not support is the following. What they're saying to essential workers, you have to go to work because you're essential. We've placed no responsibility on your employer to make that workplace safe and, if you get sick, you have no recourse because we've given your employer protection. And if you don't go to work because you're afraid of being sick and you have that job opportunity, you don't get unemployment insurance. This is so unfair. Let's just get to the heart of it. At the point of all of this is, this President--I have a new name for him, Mister Make Matters Worse. He has made matters worse from the start. Delay, denial. It's a hoax. It'll go away magically. It's a miracle, and all the rest. And we're in this situation with-- you spelled out some of the numbers very clearly early.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So with makes matters worse-- now then when we send our children to school, the best way to send our children to school is to fund it, to fund it. The ventilation--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --the spacing, the additional teachers and to lower the infection rate in the community in which they exist. That takes money.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: That's in the HEROES Act to do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker, I do want to ask you about your former colleague, John Lewis. We know that the procession in Alabama will bring him across that Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time today.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You've crossed it with him and I'm just wondering what this symbolizes to you?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the very idea that John Lewis will be crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge today in a full horse and carriage, taking him across with the state troopers, paying their respects to him, honoring him, so different from what happened before. Your show is called FACE THE NATION. And I have this pin, this pin I brought to John over Fourth of July weekend. That was the last time I saw him.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I brought him this pin and it says, \"One country, one destiny.\" That's a nation. And John's life was about that. One nation-- one country, one destiny, more perfect union.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And, again, these words were embroidered into Lincoln's coat, the coat he had on that ill-fated night. And just think that tomorrow John Lewis will lie on the catafalque that was where Lincoln was laid to rest when he came to the capital of the United States and was the-- and John F. Kennedy and the rest. But Lincoln to Lincoln. Lincoln Memorial, fifty-seven years ago. Now he's-- he's sharing that resting place with Abraham Lincoln. So, it's a number of days more that we have. We look forward to welcome him to the capital. But the-- but the most--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --iconic thing is that his life-- we know when he made his speech in fifty-seven years ago as a young man, the youngest person to speak there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And now when he left Washington on his way out of town, he went to Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, DC. He met the mayor there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We remember that.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And really passed the torch.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: He did.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: To see him there-- to see him there from one generation into the future, we-- we're so blessed. He was a titan of the Civil Rights Movement. He was the conscience of the Congress.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We-- we will miss him, sadly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Speaker.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Thank you, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn to Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, thank you for joining us. Before we get to business, your reflection on John Lewis.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas/@tedcruz): Well, John Lewis was an extraordinary hero. He was a civil rights icon. When-- when I was newly elected to the Senate, I had the-- the privilege of joining John and joining much of the Congressional Black ca-- Caucus in flying to South Africa for-- for Nelson Mandela's funeral. And-- and I was the only senator who attended Mandela's funeral and-- and the entire flight there, the flight back we-- we basically sat around John Lewis and listened to his stories of as a young man, a hero, fighting for civil rights, enduring that horrific beating on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And-- and, I have to say, he was a man who believed in justice, who had incredible courage, and-- and-- and he is an inspiration for many generations to come.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that, Senator. I-- I do want to ask you about the business at hand, which, as we know from the White House and from Leader McConnell's office, is this bill they plan to introduce tomorrow to provide another round of aid. You opposed it earlier this week. Are you on board now?\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes. I-- I am not. We have right now two simultaneous national crises. We have a global pandemic. It is serious. It has taken the lives of over six hundred thousand people. We need to do significantly more to fight the disease. At the same time, we have an absolute economic catastrophe. We have over forty-four million Americans have lost their job, and we have got to get America back to work. Unfortunately, I just listened to your interview with Speaker Pelosi, her objectives are focused on neither of those. Her objectives are shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down. And, in particular, you look at the three-trillion-dollar bill she is trying to push. It's just shoveling money to her friends and not actually solving the problem. Our objective should be Americans want to get back to work. They want to be able to provide for their family.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: They want to be-- be-- be hopeful for the future. And-- and unfortunately, Margaret, I-- I think we're seeing Democrats. We're seeing Democratic governors. We're seeing Democratic mayors who--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But what specifically-- but what specifically because in terms of the unemployment benefits, do you object to providing any kind or any amount of federal boosts to unemployment at this point? Because not everyone is choosing to be out of work.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: Okay. The policy that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are pushing adds an additional six hundred dollars a week of federal money to unemployment. We have the unemployment system, the system we have had--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And McConnell wants to take it down to seventy percent of prior wages.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: Except, the problem is, for sixty-eight percent of people receiving it right now, they are being paid more on unemployment than they made in their job. And I'll tell you, I've spoken to small business owners all over the state of Texas who are trying to reopen and they're calling their-- their waiters and waitresses--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: --they're calling their busboys, and they won't come back. And, of course, they won't come back because the federal government is paying them, in some instances, twice as much money to stay home as-- as-- as--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're open to a lesser amount?\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: I-- look, I-- what we ought to focus on, instead of just shoveling trillions out the door, we ought to be passing a recovery bill. Now, what's a recovery bill? A recovery bill would be lifting the taxes and the regulations that are hammering small businesses so that people can go back to work. A recovery bill--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: --would suspend the payroll tax, which would give a-- a-- a pay raise to everyone in America who is working. That actually gets people back to work. But what--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as the Treasury secretary said this morning that you could have five, six, seven other bills coming along that include things like a payroll tax but this time, unemployment, in particular, is something that he said needs to be extended. And-- and according to our latest CBS poll, it's very popular. Seventy-four percent of Republicans approve more stimulus and added benefits. Ninety-two percent of Democrats. Eighty-two percent of independents. So Republicans do have the burden of governing right now.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: Absolutely--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Why aren't you onboard with this?\u00a0SEN. CRUZ: I am on board with restarting the economy. What-- what Democrats want to do- we're a hundred days out from the presidential elec-- election. The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump, and they've cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America. You know Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she's proposing is keeping working men and women from working. And, you know, ironically, what she does have in her bill? She has a big tax cut for millionaires and billionaires in blue states.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I just want to quickly--\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: She eliminates--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --get to you on-- I'm sorry, I just want to quickly get you on China because I'm running out of time here. I know you care passionately about what happened in Houston with shuttering that consulate. What did you learn, and will more consulates be closed?\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, they may well be closed. That consulate was closed because it had been engaged-- engaged in espionage. It had been engaged in intellectual property theft. They use it as a base for spying in Houston and throughout the Southwest. And for a long time I-- I have made the case that China poses the greatest geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century. In fact, the last time I did this show was from Hong Kong in October.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: I traveled there. I met with the protesters. There were two million protesters in the street. And you'll recall, Margaret, I dressed in all black in solidarity with the protesters that were standing up to Beijing and to communist China. And one of the most, in fact, the most significant foreign policy consequence of this pandemic is people are understanding the threat China poses. And, in particular, this virus originated because of communist China's deliberate cover-up. They arrested, they silenced the heroic Chinese whistleblowers that tried to stop this at the outset.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: And because of that, over six hundred thousand people are dead, because the Chinese communist government lied. And, Margaret, you know, last year when I said that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator--\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: --I didn't have a lot of allies in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, you didn't have the White House on board with you then. They are now.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: They-- they are now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: People have woken up on both sides of the aisle to just how dangerous communist China is and their lies are-- are taking away people's lives.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us.\u00a0FACE THE NATION will be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. Mister Secretary, thank you for joining us. The President said this week the virus will get worse before it gets better. What does that mean? What is the administration projecting?\u00a0ALEX AZAR (Secretary of Health and Human Services/@SecAzar): Well, Margaret, as the President said, we're facing a very serious situation with these-- these outbreaks. It is serious but the good news is, thanks to the President's leadership, we have the tools to deal with it. We have health system capacity. We have personal protective equipment.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean you're-- you're, actually raising the projections? Because, very specifically, the White House had said two hundred and forty thousand Americans could succumb to this in the first wave. Does--\u00a0ALEX AZAR: Well--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --what the President said indicate you are now upping those projections?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: Well, Margaret, it's not about projections so much as what are we doing about it, which is we need to wear face coverings. We need to practice social distancing, good personal hygiene, and in our hot zones, close our bars, restrict our indoor dining, restrict our home gatherings. We know this works. The modeling shows, those--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --simple steps will lead to outcomes in terms of disease spread that are comparable to shutting down without all of the pain of shutting down. And if we comply as individuals--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --if we don't wear our masks, we can avoid further shutdowns. But if we don't, that will be the consequence.\u00a0MARGARET BERNNAN: Okay. Well, we're above a hundred and forty thousand dead, a thousand per day succumbing to this. So that is why I am asking you about the projections. Why did the President oppose, including more testing money, in this latest bill?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: Well, we-- we got twenty-five billion dollars of money in the previous acts, eleven billion of it for states. They've pulled down about forty million of it so far. The President's going to make sure that he works with Congress, that there's adequate funding for testing. I'm going to leave it to the chief of staff and the secretary of the Treasury who are negotiating with Congress now. But we'll make sure there's adequate money that meets the needs of this response.\u00a0MARGARET BERNNAN: Because Senate Democrats released a letter this week, and I've also heard the same from Senate Republicans, that they say you, in particular at HHS, are sitting on some of that money. In fact, Senate Democrats in a letter this week said that the twenty-five billion that was provided in April for testing and tracing, less than half has actually been obligated. Why is the federal government sitting on it?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: Well, we've got two billion dollars of money that's being devoted towards developing the next generation diagnostics. You know we'd love to get to the point that we have a rapid point-of-care diagnostic that is readily available, easily produced, and low cost. So we're doing that at the NIH. We have eleven billion dollars that we have pumped out to the states that they are not yet using. You know our public health labs are running at fifty-eight percent of their capacity, even though, we have the supplies to support them fully. We've got to get full shift work into those so we increase the capacities there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have no power over the states or labs to do that?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: Well, we're certainly talking to the governors and telling them they've got to use this money to get up and running and get that happening. We've made available-- we're meeting every need they've got for supplies, for-- for testing. But, at the end of the day, our governors have to take that initiative and get their public health labs fully up and running even as we improve testing through, say our commercial labs. You know, just this last week, we've approved now pooled testing at the commercial labs--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: -- that enables four or five tests to be run in a single-- a single test. So it expands capacity dramatically.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: But the most important thing we've got to do right now is each of us act responsibly as individuals, wear our face coverings, practice social distancing--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --use good personal hygiene. We know this works--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --if we just will do this as individuals.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We-- we take the health advice definitely very seriously here. I want to ask you, though, about schools. The CDC did release guidelines. HHS weighed in on them. I-- I want to know why wasn't there a benchmark on when schools should shut down?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: We don't believe that there are uniform thresholds for-- for-- for school re-openings. We believe the presumption should be--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you-- don't you actually have thresholds for what you consider a hot spot. Isn't that actually five percent very specifically laid out by the administration? Why wouldn't that apply to a school in a district with that number?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: So, Margaret, the-- what you're referring to is positive testing--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --and at five percent, we call that a yellow community. At ten percent, we call it red. That's an epidemiological early warning sign of potential spread of disease. That's not been defined as a threshold for reopening of any kind. The steps that we can use that are data driven, informed by doctors, they're smart, sensible approaches that can get our kids back safely--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So if positivity--\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --and our staff back safely to school.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So if positivity-- if positivity is between five and ten percent, should a school stay open?\u00a0ALEX AZAR: Each community is going to have to make the determination about the circumstances for reopening and what steps they take for reopening, but the presumption should be--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --we get our kids back to school--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, Mister Secretary.\u00a0ALEX AZAR: --and we figure out how to make that happen.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to hit this commercial break and leave that there with you. Thank you very much, Secretary Azar. We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up, the life and legacy of Congressman John Lewis.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We now go to former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you, Doctor. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're around 70,000 infections a day, 1,000 Americans dead. You've described this as four separate epidemics. Where are we now? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, the epicenter of the epidemic right now in the United States has been the Sunbelt, states like California, Texas, Arizona, Florida. There are signs that the cases in these states are starting to plateau. That- that trend is most discernible in Arizona and Texas right now, where you see the positivity rate declining. It's a little bit more of a mixed bag in Florida and California. I think we're gonna have to wait another week to see how those states net out. But there are unmistakable signs that the epidemic seems to be slowing in these states. Now, at the same time, it seems to be heating up in other states. So if you look at states like Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, all hitting highs on the number of new cases being reported. So the epidemic may be shifting to other regions in the country. I think Arizona in particular is a very instructive case because if they're able to start to bring down the epidemic in that state, largely what will have done it is some selective action by the governor. He did take some targeted mitigation steps like closing the bars, but more the collective action of individuals to withdraw some of their actions, stay home a little bit more and more adherence to masks. And so if they're able to get the epidemic under control with those more targeted measures and more collective action on the parts of consumers, that's a good guidepost for the future and how other states may control their epidemics. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Indiana, Illinois, Georgia, Alabama, you've highlighted them all. Would you recommend to those governors that they get ahead of it and do some of those things like shuttering bars and mandating masks? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think that's exactly right. I think looking at what Governor Ducey did in Arizona is somewhat instructive. They did take some targeted mitigation steps in that state, like shutting bars, dialing back how many people could be in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of entertainment venues outside. At the same time, they did implement the mask mandate, a little late, but they did do it. And you did start to see consumers decrease their activity. Google mobility trends started to decline in the state. And so if that sort of trifecta of activity can have the effect of quelling an epidemic without the really significant mitigation steps that we took during the first wave of the epidemic, that's a hopeful sign. And it's also a suggestion that states that now have made gains in getting their epidemics under control, like the state of Connecticut that I'm in right now, perhaps they can keep their epidemics under control if they can just maintain adherence to things like masks and keep certain high risk congregate venues like bars closed through the duration of the really risky period for this epidemic in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's interesting because, again, we are seeing the private sector make its own decisions. McDonald's joining Walmart, Starbucks, other large retailers this week in requiring masks to be worn indoors. Is this a way around the politics? I mean, do you look at\u00a0that and say this is what we should be doing? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think so, and I think it's a very good way around the politics. If enough businesses mandate masks in their venues, you effectively have a national mask mandate. You\u00a0 know, Delta Airlines announced this week that if you don't wear masks on their planes, they may ban you from flying on their planes for life. I think you're going to see more collective action on the parts of businesses. I've been talking with some CEOs in the past week, and I think you're going to see more businesses come together to implement mask mandates in venues, especially indoor high risk venues, to try to keep this epidemic under control. I mean, if we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness just with masks, that's going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesn't really change our lives and allows us to maintain what's really important to us, like keeping some businesses open, like getting our kids back to school. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are looking at going back to school within a matter of weeks. I have been talking to people this week about testing. I know people who have been waiting weeks for results. I know LabCorp told F.T. this week that it's taking about four to six days for people to get results. You've said they're basically useless unless you get them within three days. Do you have to fix this before we can open schools safely? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think you do. I think one of the things you need to look at in a local community is whether or not you can get test results, because if you can't get test results back in a timely fashion, you really don't have a way to detect whether there is an outbreak in the community or in the school. And while we do need to lean forward and try to open our schools because it's important to children, we need to prevent outbreaks from happening in the schools. We can't just let the infection run rampant inside the schools. And having good testing in place is going to be a critical tool. I talked to the CEO of LabCorp yesterday. They've gotten caught up. They're doing about 175,000 tests a week. They're going to be returning test results maybe within two or three days right now. Hopefully, Quest will get caught up as well. But if we do have other major epidemics, other major hotspots emerge, the testing system can become strained again. We're heading towards about 750,000 tests a day and will probably be at a million by the end of this month. So we have a lot of testing capacity. The problem is when you have these major epidemics in multiple regions of the country, it can strain the system. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC did come out with guidelines this week on how to reopen schools, but they left out when you should shut them down. What is the benchmark that parents need to be looking for to make that decision? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, the CDC didn't put a benchmark in that guidance and I think it was unfortunate. I think in the absence of specific guidance to districts, you're likely to see more districts err on the side of caution. So I think CDC should have addressed this. It was probably deliberate that they didn't because they don't want to address something that was politically charged. But for local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community. If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop. I think you need to look at the density of students in the schools. So you'll see some districts, for example, opening the elementary schools to five days a week in class learning because they can de-densify those schools. But maybe the high schools, they'll go to a hybrid model where it's harder to de-densify the schools. Schools are looking at retrofitting HVAC systems to improve air quality, the use of mandatory masks. And I think one of the most important features, and a lot of other countries did this with success is keeping students in defined cohorts or pods so you don't have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DR. GOTTLIEB: --a lot of students intermingling. You have the same fifteen students gathering together. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're a parent. If you see a positivity rate above 5%, which is hotspot territory, do you send your kid to school? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think somewhere in five to 10% it's starting to get iffy. Above 10% I think that's a threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts, because that is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community. So those are the kinds of things you're looking at. I'm- I'm in Connecticut right now. We've got the infection under control. I think we're going to have the opportunity to open the schools here. But when you look at states like Florida or Southern California, I mean California has already made the decision not to open the schools. I think it's going to be very hard in parts of Florida to open schools on time because of the outbreaks. And you're also seeing a lot of parents make proactive decisions to keep their kids home. So districts in Maryland, for example, that were giving an option to parents, a flexible option to parents, they surveyed those parents and enough parents said we're not going to be sending our kids that the districts just made the decision to close the schools. And that shows that in the- in the setting of uncertainty and- and the lack of specific guidance about how to keep schools open, I think more parents are going to err on the side of caution. That's why it's very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that CDC didn't do in this guidance. There's still time to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DR. GOTTLIEB: But I think we need to think about it. Things like positivity rate. What is the local spread? What is the testing capacity in place in a local community? Those are the metrics you want to be looking at. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I agree. More information is always better. I'm glad you gave us a benchmark. Always good to talk to you, Dr. Gottlieb. MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to Gene Woods, the president and chief executive officer of Atrium Health, which operates 36 hospitals and over 900 care locations in North and South Carolina, as well as Georgia and he joins us from Charlotte this morning. Good morning to you. Well, we heard you testify before the Senate committee this past week, and you said at the time that you could process about 4,000 COVID tests a day, but that you're actually unable in your labs to do that because of shortages. What do you need to fix this problem? And does that need to come from the state or federal government? ATRIUM CEO GENE WOODS: Well, thanks for the question. I think, yeah, we have our own in-house capabilities to run our tests and- and- and many times we can do actually same day turnaround. The challenge that we've expressed that I expressed at the Senate was that we don't have enough reagents, which is actually the chemical compound that you can- that you use to process these tests. So we have- we've asked for- part of my request to the Senate was really in part we may need a national registry in terms of how these supplies are distributed to hot spots around the country. But we certainly- we believe that we at Atrium can do more. We want to do more. We just need some more of the testing reagents to be able to continue to serve the community as we have.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: In all of your facilities, supply-wise, what is the area of greatest needs- need? WOODS: Well, the good thing is that we spent the last several months stocking up on PPE. We stocked up on ventilators. And so we feel like we're in a much better shape than we were before, starting this pandemic. The other thing is you've heard a lot about hospital capacity. The thing I'm as excited about is early on, we realized that we needed to have more capacity inside of the hospital. So we launched what we call a virtual hospital. And so imagine if you have COVID and you are actually being treated in your own bedroom. And we've converted people's homes and bedrooms into the hospital rooms. We have monitoring. We do virtual visits. And if you need something like medications, we're working with the paramedics to actually deliver them into your home. So we've actually cared for about 11,000 COVID patients in their homes. And I think that gives me a lot of confidence going forward as we continue to battle COVID, that we'll have the- the beds that we need to serve the community. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also been looking at how to target the communities that have been hardest hit. And as we know from the CDC, Blacks and Latinos are three times as likely to become infected. What are you seeing in your community? Why this disparity? WOODS: Yeah, you know, what COVID has magnified the disparities and the crisis and marginalized- marginalized communities. You know and as we as we think about, you know, the legacy of Congressman John Lewis, he said if- if you see something that's not right, we have a moral obligation to fix it and address it. And that's why early on, we engaged with communities of color, these marginalized communities. First of all, we had established relationships there, but also we have the data. We had the science. We saw early on- we- we geo-spatially mapped hotspots in our communities down to the zip code. And what we saw early on was the disparities in testing. So we worked with the pastors, we worked with the community leaders, and we loaded up mobile vans, medical vans with supplies and personnel. And we said to the- to the- to the pastors in the community, where do you need us? So we went into the parking lots. We went wherever- wherever we were needed. And in a matter of about a week's time, we eliminated the disparities of testing in these vulnerable communities. And our message to the community has been, you know, we- we were there before this started.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 WOODS: We're going to be there throughout, and we're gonna be here past this pandemic. And I will say, MARGARET, as- as a Black man that also has Spanish heritage, this is personal for me. You know, I feel the vulnerability of these communities. They could be my cousins. They could be my uncles. They could be my aunts.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 WOODS: And it's also personal for our organization. From our board to our leaders to our- to our frontline, our mission is to care for all and that extends well beyond our walls. And we're going to be there for the long haul-- MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Are you--\u00a0 WOODS: -- to deal with inequities.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to ask in your conversations with Congress for your health care workers to be at the front of the line for a vaccine? And what do you see happening with distribution of it? WOODS: Yes, we have asked that health care workers throughout the country, especially in the hot spot areas, be- be- be at the front of the line together with essential workers, including teachers and and so forth. So we've already made that- that request. The challenge, and I shared this with the- the Senate committee is that, you know, even when we have the flu, a flu season, 40% of Americans say they're not going to get vaccinated. And so what you heard in my testimony was that I do think we need to launch a national campaign, national PSA that really talks about the benefits of vaccination, because I'd be very, very concerned-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 WOODS: -- if- if we did get a vaccination and then we had a problem with actually adoption. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we need to start talking about that. Gene Woods, thank you very much. We'll be right back. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's 100 days until Election Day. This morning, we have a new CBS battleground tracker that looks at national trends and the presidential race in two Midwestern states, Ohio and Michigan. President Trump won both in 2016 and our results today show Ohio is competitive. President Trump is up 46 to Biden's 45. But in Michigan, former Vice President Joe Biden leads. He's up 48 to 42. CBS News Elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto joins us from his home today in Westchester County, New York. Good morning, Anthony.\u00a0 ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, MARGARET. How are you doing?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm doing well. I want you to explain to us, you know, what is driving the vote in these two states?\u00a0 (00:00:48) SALVANTO: Well, first thing we should say is that we see an increasingly expanding Electoral College map because of what's going on in these two states. They're both pivotal, as you said. The president won them last time and at least Ohio, he probably needs to win again. But you look at what's happening, let's start with Michigan. Well, that state was hard hit by the Corona virus outbreak last spring and there's still some lingering negativity about how the administration handled that response. In fact, most voters in Michigan tell us they think the administration's efforts hurt the state more than helped it. So that's number one. Then, number two, we see big negatives among voters for how they think the president handles himself personally. And that is something that's accruing then to Joe Biden, where we find that more of Joe Biden's voters feel like they're voting more against the president than for Joe Biden. Now, I should add, economics here are something of awash. It's about even between which candidates policies would help revive the economy. In Ohio, some good news for the president. He's seen as a little better on protecting American manufacturing jobs. But all of that really adds up to not only are these states pivotal on that Electoral College map, but also they exemplify the kinds of voters who swung to him last time and he probably needs again, MARGARET.\u00a0 (00:02:13) MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you don't get more personal than talking about someone's children. And the president's been talking quite a lot about trying to get kids back in classrooms, back to school this fall. How are voters receiving that? (00:02:26) SALVANTO: So when we interviewed parents, we found a real wariness about sending their kids back to school in any regular way. They would prefer at most a limited reopening and many would actually prefer not to have the schools reopened at all. There's still that real concern about coronavirus and what it might do to children. But where this cuts to vote, MARGARET, is we see parents telling us that they feel like the administration is pressuring schools to reopen. And what that's doing is it's making parents feel, they say, like they're- they're getting the impression the president doesn't care as much about the risk of coronavirus to children. And look, in any election, that empathy part is always part of how people select a candidate. And if there's an empathy gap there between the president and Joe Biden, that then is probably advantaging Joe Biden, at least for the moment, MARGARET. (00:03:23) MARGARET BRENNAN: The president this week was tweeting about suburban housewives of America. That was the phrase he used. It seems that's who he is trying to target. I'm not asking what his strategy is, but I'm wondering why he has focused on this demographic, and who is that demo anyway? What does that mean? (00:03:43) SALVANTO: So a couple of things and sort of a user's guide going forward to this election. One is you're going to hear the word suburban a lot. It means a wide range of things to a lot of people. Often a stand in for middle class. Often a stand in for areas of the country where there's more competitiveness. We often find nowadays that a lot of these suburbs are moving towards the Democrats. A lot of them did in the midterms in 2018. So that's something that the Republicans would certainly try to win back. Now, as far as the women's vote is concerned, we see that, too, with large gaps toward Joe Biden. He's doing better among women in particular. We'll talk a lot about white college degree holding women. Those groups have been moving towards the Democrats. And that's the kind of trend that the Republicans and the president's campaign probably wants to try to slow down or reverse, MARGARET. (00:04:40) MARGARET BRENNAN: And probably why he sent that tweet this week. Anthony Salvanto, thank you for breaking it down for us. We'll be back in a moment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Civil rights icon and longtime Congressman John Lewis is being remembered this week in a series of memorials and services. CBS News anchor and national correspondent Michelle Miller is in Selma, Alabama. Michelle, the nation has been in mourning for a week now. What has stood out to you? MICHELLE MILLER: Really MARGARET the women, the women who are taking the lead on speaking out about how this man not only paid homage to them and lifted them up, but they're wanting folks to know about it. I mean, the civil rights movement is something you heard about the men in the movement, the Martin Luther King's, the Whitney Young's, the Big Six. They got all the attention. But you didn't hear about the Amelia Boynton Robinson's or the Annie Lee Cooper's, women who were beaten for daring to cross this bridge or daring to try and register to vote. And women like Chris- Sheyann Webb Christburg who, at eight years old, walked across this bridge and were counseled because she was so traumatized by what she had seen the youngest person to walk that bridge. She spoke about him last night at the A.M.E. Church. She spoke about how he stayed in touch with her to- these past 60 years. Or the Terri Sewell's, the first black woman to represent the state of Alabama ever, who went to Capitol Hill and the minute she got there, she said that Lewis was there to- to greet her, to mentor her, to guide her. In fact, he- he insisted that she become a co-pilgrimage maker every year to cross this bridge with her and was always there to take a stand with her. I think of the Women's March of 2017 and the fact that many of those leaders, including Tamika Mallory who said he was the first in Congress to legitimize that movement. And she showed me a letter that he had written about a week before he died to not just her, but others in the movement saying, \"I passed the torch on to you. I passed the torch. And I know it will burn brightly.\" And I just want to mention one woman who walked here wearing a purple T-shirt. It said Y.O.I.E. standing for, she said, \"your only is enough.\" Inspired by John Lewis, she said, because, you know, if you can only register five people to vote, then that is enough. Again, his mantra, if you see something wrong, say something, do something. And that is his lasting legacy. MARGARET BRENNAN: I love that passing of the baton, Michelle. With this procession and this process of mourning, what should we expect in the coming days? MILLER: The family does not want people to travel because of the pandemic, of course, but a lot more taking place. This afternoon Lewis will lie in repose at the Alabama state capitol in Montgomery, which ironically was the end point for the famous 1965 march. On Monday, there's a procession through the streets of the nation's capital, and an invitation-only ceremony as Lewis' casket arrives to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Later Monday evening, an outdoor viewing with social distancing protocols in effect on the east front steps of the Capitol, that viewing continues on Tuesday. Wednesday, he will be returned to his adopted hometown of Atlanta and ceremonies at the Georgia state capitol. Finally, Thursday and the official funeral at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the pastoral home of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Junior. And although that would be Ebenezer's New Horizon Sanctuary, it is still something very- that is expected to be very special. The burial that afternoon will take place in Atlanta, South-View Cemetery. He will be laid to rest next to his beloved wife, Lillian, who passed away back in 2012. So near a full week of celebrations in honor of John Lewis, MARGARET. MARGARET BRENNAN: A celebration of his life and his message. Michelle Miller, thank you. I know you'll be covering it for all of us.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden's search for a running mate is underway. Based on CBS News' reporting, the Biden campaign is vetting the following women to potentially be the first female vice president. The vetting process may look a little different this year because of the constraints caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Biden recently said he expects to announce his running mate decision sometime in early August. The next step in the vetting process is sometime in July for the serious contenders to one-on-one interviews with Biden. While the process started with more than a dozen women rumored to be under consideration, sources have told CBS News Biden is seriously considering five to eight of these potential picks. Beyond contact with the vetting committee, top Biden staff like campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon and other senior advisers are in frequent contact \u2014 sometimes every day \u2014 with aides to these women.\u00a0 Several high-profile Democrats told CBS News they are urging Biden to pick a woman of color and one of the vetting committee members, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, has pledged to bring these recommendations into the deliberation room. Long before he became the presumptive nominee in April, Biden outlined what he would look for in a running mate. He said his vice president should have the experience necessary to be president at a moment's notice, have strengths where he has weaknesses, and share a certain \"simpatico\" quality with him. KAMALA HARRIS, CALIFORNIA SENATOR Senator Kamala Harris of California has long been rumored to be a frontrunner for the position. As the former California attorney general, Harris could bring law enforcement and recent legislative experience to the ticket. Harris was also the only Black woman to launch a presidential bid during this primary cycle. However, many have not forgotten Harris' confrontation of Biden during the first Democratic debate over busing and his remarks about segregationist senators. Questions surrounding Harris' time as a prosecutor and California attorney general have also raised concerns among some of the more progressive wings of the party, although lately, she has been working with progressive legislators on bills in the House and Senate. Harris has become an increasingly visible Biden campaigner. She has said that she has a \"great deal of affection,\" for Biden and said at a fundraiser for Biden back in April, \"He sees people. He understands their pain, he understands their dreams.\"\u00a0 Biden at the same event caused a storm of speculation that Harris might be a leading running mate contender when he said, \"I'm so lucky to have you as part of this, this partnership going forward,\" and added, \"So, I'm coming for you, kid.\" \u00a0 Harris was asked during a recent interview with MSNBC if she was currently being vetted for the position, and she declined to answer. If a Biden-Harris ticket were to win in 2020, the Democratic governor of the state, Gavin Newsom, would appoint a new California senator to replace Harris, so it would likely not affect the balance of the Senate. Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Tim Perry.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR, MINNESOTA SENATOR Biden said on his podcast in April that he \"wouldn't be the nominee\" without the help of Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. The three-term senator ended her own presidential campaign just before Super Tuesday in March and endorsed Biden later that evening in an energetic Texas campaign rally. The next day with her support, Biden won her home state of Minnesota over Senator Bernie Sanders, who won the state's primary in 2016. During her own presidential campaign the senator, 59, regularly touted the hundreds of bills she has passed in the Senate, a statistic the former vice president seems to appreciate.\u00a0 Klobuchar's formidable debate skills impressed Biden during the primary race. When she mentioned the Democratic debates as she endorsed him, he interjected, \"all which you won.\" He has also complimented Klobuchar's commitment to bipartisan legislation. Her whole campaign somewhat mirrored Biden's own message about winning back the Midwest and the Rust Belt, areas where Donald Trump flipped in the last election.\u00a0 Klobuchar has also proven to be an adept fundraiser for Biden, bringing in $1.5 million for him at a virtual fundraiser in May. And as is the case for Harris, if Klobuchar were on a winning ticket with Biden, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, would choose a replacement, likely leaving the Senate balance unchanged. But Klobuchar said in June that she was withdrawing her name from consideration. \"I thought a lot about it, and I truly believe that this is a historic moment for our country, really in our history,\" Klobuchar told CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe. \"And this is a moment to seize. And you have moments in history where you look back at 'em and you think, was that the right thing? And I think the right thing to do right now, and I told this to Vice President Biden, is to put a woman of color on the ticket as the next vice president of our country.\" \"I think it would be something that would help heal the United States,\" she added. \"I think it is something that would really take what has been a tragedy, but also a galvanizing moment and turn it into a moment of joy. And I think our country is looking for that right now.\" Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Bo Erickson.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN, MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR\u00a0 Elizabeth Warren was for a time one of the main barriers standing between Biden and the Democratic nomination. Releasing a succession of plans over the past year \u2014 \"I've got a plan for that\" became a catch phrase \u2014 the Massachusetts senator often led the policy discussion in the Democratic primary. She popularized ideas like eliminating student loan debt for most Americans. Recently, Biden embraced a more fulsome effort to help Americans address student debt. Beyond endorsing Biden and unequivocally telling MSNBC's Rachel Maddow she would accept an offer to be his running mate, Warren has largely stayed away from public lobbying for the job. She has focused on oversight and protections in government COVID-19 relief packages, becoming a leading voice in the Senate calling for increased rights for essential workers, debt relief for consumers and a national contact tracing program, among other measures. Warren, who led the oversight commission for the 2008 financial crisis bailout, has also been a critic of the Trump Administration's coronavirus response. Warren led Democrats' choices on who should be Biden's running mate and who should be considered in an early May\u00a0CBS News poll. But while she might be acceptable to the Democratic base, her progressive policies could be a concern for moderate Republicans on the fence, independents, or for the more moderate Biden.\u00a0 Biden has said he would pick someone with whom he is \"simpatico,\" and his political differences with Warren could prove too great. The two differ both on prime issues like health care and on messaging as candidates. While Biden called for a return to order from the campaign trail, Warren demanded, \"Big structural change.\" And while Warren swore off high-dollar fundraising events at the start of her campaign, he frequently made stops on the trail to boost his war chest.\u00a0 The two famously clashed over bankruptcy reform a decade and a half ago, before Warren ever ran for office, but in March Biden backed Warren's latest bankruptcy plan, demonstrating a willingness to bend to some of her more progressive views. In a video released Sunday, the two teamed up on what had been a staple of Warren's campaign: calling and thanking small-dollar donors.\u00a0 \"I was kidding with the senator a moment ago. I said, you know, I used to call my contributors, but I never had as many until she endorsed me.\" he said. \"And so I'm counting on her a great deal not just for endorsement but for her ideas and her leadership.\" Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, NEVADA SENATOR\u00a0 Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was once considered a dark horse candidate for Biden's running mate. She was the first female senator elected from Nevada, and the first Latina ever to serve in the upper chamber. Prior to her senatorial election in 2016 when she replaced Harry Reid, Cortez Masto served as attorney general for eight years.\u00a0 During that tenure she worked closely with then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris and the late Beau Biden, who was then Delaware attorney general. Biden campaigned for Cortez Masto in 2016 and spoke about his son's relationship with her on the trail. Cortez Masto evoked that friendship last week when she officially endorsed the former VP calling the late Biden, \"a good friend.\" Nonetheless, there are questions about whether she'd accept the offer if it were made. The governor of Nevada is also a Democrat, Steve Sisolak, and he would be expected to select a Democrat to replace Cortez Masto in the event of a vacancy. But Cortez Masto said at the end of May that she was taking herself out of the running. \"I support Joe Biden 100% and will work tirelessly to help get him elected this November. It is an honor to be considered as a potential running mate but I have decided to withdraw my name from consideration,\" Cortez Masto said in an official statement on May 28. The senator said her focus will remain on Nevadans in the wake of COVID-19. \u00a0 Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Cara Korte. GRETCHEN WHITMER, MICHIGAN GOVERNOR Governor Gretchen Whitmer has garnered national attention for leading the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic, drawing criticisms from President Donald Trump and driving speculation that she is considered to be Biden's running mate. Biden, who won the Michigan primary on March 10, said in early April that Whitmer is on his list of potential running mates. In an interview with Politico on April 27, Whitmer said she has not turned over any documents to the Biden campaign for vetting and explained that she is not lobbying for the job. \"I just know that you know you don't run for that,\" Whitmer said. \"That is a selection of the top of the ticket and everyone else should be just busy doing their jobs.\" In multiple interviews throughout the month of April, Whitmer, one of the national campaign co-chairs for Biden's campaign, has not been as forceful as some other vice presidential contenders when asked if she is willing to serve as Biden's running mate. She said it was an honor to be mentioned with a \"phenomenal caliber of women leaders,\" but she has repeatedly stated she has devoted her energy entirely to handling the coronavirus pandemic in Michigan. In an interview with CNN, Whitmer said she campaigned for two years to become Michigan's governor, adding that \"the job that I want is the one that I have.\"\u00a0 \"While it has been challenging and there have been some tough days, there is no place I would rather be than right here in my home state, making decisions that are saving people's lives,\" Whitmer noted in the CNN interview. \"I think it is the honor of my lifetime to be here.\" Democrats are hoping to win Michigan after President Trump won the state by nearly 11,000 votes. In 2018, Whitmer, who notoriously ran on the message to \"fix the damn roads,\" was elected governor in 2018 and defeated the Republican candidate Bill Schuette by nearly 10 points. Michigan was one of seven states in the 2018 midterm election where the governor's mansion flipped from Republican to Democratic.\u00a0 Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0 MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM, NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, elected to her first term in 2018, is one of a handful of governors expected to be considered as a potential running mate. Lujan Grisham also served as a member of the House of Representatives for six years, giving her the federal experience some might be looking for to fill the position. While in Congress, Lujan Grisham served as the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus during her last year in office. Currently overseeing her state's pandemic measures, she has seen some success including her state having the first drive- through testing for COVID-19.\u00a0 When CNN asked Lujan Grisham about being a potential pick she said, \"I want to be the governor of New Mexico. I will do whatever it takes to support a Biden administration, and I'm looking forward to a federal administration that can do a national strategy in good times and in bad times, both.\" If she's selected and the ticket wins, the lieutenant governor, Howie Morales, also a Democrat, would become governor. Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Tim Perry. STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE Stacey Abrams has been on the speculative lists of potential Democratic running mates since before the party had a nominee. Even in losing her run for Georgia governor in 2018, the former Georgia state House minority leader has been a rising star in the party for years. Though Abrams passed on running for the Senate and White House in 2020, she has been forthright in expressing her wish to be Joe Biden's running mate.\u00a0 \"I would be an excellent running mate,\" she told Elle Magazine.\u00a0 While some critics have questioned Abrams' outspokenness, others have simply said that she is unqualified. According to the New York Post, one Biden insider said, \"Picking Stacey would be like picking [Sarah] Palin. He doesn't need to throw a Hail Mary. He wants a good governing partner.\" Nevertheless, Abrams has been a stalwart Biden supporter and defender in the lead up to the vetting process. She was the first potential running mate to comment on Tara Reade's assault allegations, telling HuffPo in April that she stood behind Biden.\u00a0 Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Cara Korte.\u00a0 TAMMY BALDWIN, WISCONSIN SENATOR Senator Tammy Baldwin could offer a rare mix of progressivism and swing state support to Biden's ticket. She has spent her time in Washington farther left than Biden on several issues including healthcare \u2014 she was an early supporter of \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 but she has twice won by a wide margin in the swing state of Wisconsin, which President Trump carried in 2016. A lesbian, Baldwin would also be the first LGBTQ candidate on the presidential ticket for any major party. Despite some of her progressive positions, Baldwin has recently shown a willingness to work with the other side. In late April, she teamed up with Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley to request that the Federal Trade Commission launch an anti-trust investigation in the meatpacking industry as companies shut down pork plants after COVID-19 infections in workers. Baldwin has been less blunt than some other contenders about her interest in a vice president job, but has indicated that she sees her Wisconsin success as an asset to the Biden campaign, and that she is there to help.\u00a0 \"I am in regular contact with the Biden campaign,\" she told CBSN last week. \"I want to make sure that that Vice President Biden becomes the next president of the United States. If Baldwin's seat were to become vacant, it would likely remain vacant until a special election in 2021. Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 TAMMY DUCKWORTH, ILLINOIS SENATOR\u00a0 Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois endorsed Biden one day before Super Tuesday, where Biden picked up significant wins to pave his way to becoming the presumptive nominee. By July,\u00a0 Duckworth has been getting a more serious look to be Biden's potential running mate.\u00a0 Duckworth told CNN in July that she \"will do whatever I need to do to support\" Biden. When asked if Biden's running mate needs to be Black woman, Duckworth added, \"I think that Joe Biden needs to make his own mind and will make his own mind. I don't think it's on any of us to dictate to him.\" In an interview with the Daily Herald in April, Duckworth commented on speculation that Biden is considering her to be his running mate, saying she \"would take any invitation to serve at the pleasure of a president very seriously.\" Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid praised Duckworth, saying that the Illinois senator is \"one of the most amazing people I've ever met,\"\u00a0 \"She's one of my heroes. So \u2014 but the decision is going to be up to Joe Biden, not up to me,\" Reid told CBS News in an interview.\u00a0 Fox News host Tucker Carlson questioned Duckworth's patriotism after Duckworth said that the country should have a \"national dialogue\" about potentially removing statues of George Washington. Carlson criticized Duckworth, calling her a \"deeply silly and unimpressive person.\" Duckworth responded on Twitter, tweeting, \"Does @TuckerCarlson want to walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not I love America?\" If selected to be Biden's running mate, Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who lost both of her legs in combat, would be the first Asian-American woman to be on the ticket. Duckworth served in the House of Representatives for four years and was the former assistant secretary of the Veterans Affairs Administration before becoming a U.S. senator.\u00a0 Duckworth made history in 2018 when she became the first senator to give birth while in office. Senators have to cast their vote in person, but babies weren't allowed on the Senate floor. The Senate voted to change the rules in order for Duckworth to bring her daughter, Maile, onto the Senate floor so Duckworth could vote.\u00a0 If her seat were left vacant, Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker would name a new senator, likely leaving the balance of the Senate unchanged. Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0 FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN VAL DEMINGS\u00a0 While she may not be the most prominent contender of those being considered for the Democratic vice presidential pick, Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida has been rumored to be in the mix. Demings, who was a Democratic House manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, was elected to Congress in 2016 and is up for re-election this year.\u00a0 She endorsed Biden in March, just two days after his strong Super Tuesday showing, when he picked up primary wins in nearly all of the 14 contests held that day. \"As a former social worker, a former career law enforcement officer, and a former police chief, I've seen the best of America and I've seen the worst of America,\" said Demings during the CNN interview when she endorsed Biden. \"\u2026America is always at its best when people have the opportunity to succeed and we have leaders in place who understand that.\" Before her election to Congress, Demings worked with the Orlando Police Department for 27 years and made history in 2007 by becoming the city's first woman police chief. In Congress, she sits on multiple committees and is a member of various caucuses including the Congressional Black Caucus. During an interview with MSNBC AM Joy in April, Demings said she would definitely step into the role of vice presidential candidate if asked. \"If Joe Biden asked me to serve as his vice president during such a critical and tough time for our nation, of course I would say yes to continue to serve the people who need the help the most.\" If her seat were to become open, it would be filled by special election. Reported by 2020 Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER SUSAN RICE Susan Rice has deep connections with President Obama's administration \u2014 she served as his national security adviser and as the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations. In an interview with MSNBC, Rice commented on rumors that Biden's team is considering her to be Biden's running mate, saying she is \"humbled and honored to among the extremely accomplished women who are reportedly being considered.\" Rice added that she would agree to serve as Biden's running mate if asked. \"I want to help enable him to become the next President of United States, in any way I can, and to support him if he wins in any way I can, because I believe that's what is vitally important for the future of our country,\" Rice said. \"And it's not about me. It's not about my ambitions. I am not campaigning for anything. But, you know, obviously, if \u2014 if that were the role in which he felt I could best serve, then I'm not going to say no.\" Rice has not held elective office, but she has foreign policy experience, which is often a part of a vice president's portfolio. Rice, however, faced a strong backlash from Republicans after the Benghazi attack on American government facilities in 2012. The criticism of Rice stemmed from her remark the Benghazi attack was a spontaneous protest against the anti-Islamic video. The intelligence Rice shared turned out to be wrong, when evidence later emerged showing the attack was a concerted terrorist effort. Rice recently wrote an op-ed in the New York Times advocating for free and fair elections in November. As voting rights and voting changes are rising to the forefront of a presidential election year and amid the coronavirus pandemic, Rice wrote that Congress should provide $5 billion to fund elections and require states to provide reforms to make voting easier, like allowing at least 20 days of early voting and drive-through voting. Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0 SALLY YATES, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\u00a0 Joe Biden floated Sally Yates' name as a woman qualified to be vice president in Iowa late last year, but the former deputy attorney general has stayed largely out of the public eye since the campaign started. Yates earned widespread respect in the Democratic Party for refusing to defend President Donald Trump's travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries when she served as acting attorney general. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called her a \"profile in courage\" after her firing. Yates again clashed with President Trump when she testified in a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing about the warnings she and President Obama had given the Trump administration about ties Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn had to Russia. Now working at a law firm in Atlanta, she has never held elected office. But she has a long resume, working as a prosecutor and as Georgia attorney general, including leading the prosecution of the Centennial Atlanta Olympic Park bomber. \u00a0 In a statement endorsing Biden in March, Yates said she was endorsing Biden because she trusts him: \"\"I trust him to always put the country's interests before his own; to tell us the truth; to appeal to our best, not our worst, instincts; to unite rather than divide us; and to always treat the presidency as a privilege rather than an entitlement.\" Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, ATLANTA MAYOR One woman under serious consideration is Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, an early primary supporter of the former vice president.\u00a0 Bottoms, who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 along with some members of her family, received high marks at the start of the virus's spread from some for her city's handling pandemic.\u00a0 She was also seen as a unifying voice of reason during the protests and riots that ensued after the death of George Floyd. Bottoms, who is Black, talks often about the historic significance it would have if Biden were to choose a Black woman as his running mate. She often says that due to her name being in consideration as well as her governing experience she is the \"hope of the slave.\" \"I won't pretend that it's not a big deal to me to have my name mentioned. But what I've said from the beginning is I want Joe Biden to win.\" Bottoms said at the Aspen Ideas Festival earlier this month. \"If it's me, it's something I would give serious consideration to. And if it's someone else that he thinks is better suited to help him win in November, when there's so much at stake with our country right now and with the future for my children and are our not yet born children, I'm going to do and support whomever he thinks is best suited to help him get there in November.\" Reported by 2020 campaign reporter Tim Perry.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden expressed regret Friday for\u00a0comments\u00a0made earlier in the day on an influential radio program, \"The Breakfast Club.\" In a phone call with members of the U.S. Black Chambers, a business organization, Biden sought to clarify and explain \u2014 but did not explicitly apologize \u2014 for his comments, according to\u00a0CBS News political reporter Ed O'Keefe,\u00a0producer Rebecca Kaplan,\u00a0campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers. \"If you have a problem figuring out if you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,\" Biden said. \"It don't have nothing to do with Trump \u2014 it has to do with the fact that I want something for my community,\" host Charlamagne Tha God countered. Biden replied that he should take a look at his voting record to see his longtime support for the black community. During the phone call Friday afternoon, Biden said this: \"I should not have been so cavalier. I've never, never, ever taken the African American community for granted.\" He continued, \"No one no one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background. There are African Americans who think that Trump was worth voting for, I don't think so. I'm prepared to put my record against his. That was the bottom line and it was ah \u2013 it was really unfortunate, I shouldn't have been so cavalier.\" On a Trump campaign call with reporters Friday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports Republican Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina said he was \"shocked\" by the former vice president's comments. \"I thought to myself, I've been black for 54 years,\" Scott said. \"I was struck by the condescension and the arrogance.\" Addressing fellow lawmakers in the Senate, Scott urged his colleagues to disavow the comments. \"Race baiting in the 21st century is an ineffective tool to attract one of the most intelligent voting blocks in the nation,\" he remarked. Meanwhile, Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson said, \"We hear a lot on the left, particularly in the media, about white privilege.\" She continued \"And I think that this video is the perfect example. An 80-year-old white man telling a young black man how to be black is the definition of white privilege,\" misstating Biden's age. Both surrogates for the president touted the Trump administration's support of permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities and\u00a0opportunity zones.\u00a0President Trump has not been on\u00a0The Breakfast Club Morning Show, hosted by DJ Envy, Angela Yee and Charlamagne Tha God. Pierson said she \"would not be opposed\" to the president joining the program in the future, noting that the White House dictates Mr. Trump's schedule. In a\u00a0video posted to Twitter on Friday, Michigan Republican Senate candidate John James called the former vice president's remarks, \"some seriously condescending, out of touch bullcrap.\" The U.S. Army Veteran added, \"You should think long and hard about what you said and what it means. And also your use of the word 'ain't.' You should also make sure you carry hot sauce in your purse next time.\" CBS News polling shows Biden is supported by 9 in 10 African American voters nationwide. Biden has said he's considering several black women for vice president. The list includes Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, who on Friday told CBS News in a statement, \"I understand the feelings around this morning's interview, and we will continue to use the talent, strength, and ingenuity in the Black community to hold all candidates accountable, even the ones we support. That's what mutual respect looks like. As we try to deal with a public health crisis, the total absence of leadership in the White House, and a nation where divisions of race have been purposefully exploited, we should all be cognizant of the words we use.\" Demings added, \"We need a president who is willing to work hard and fight for real solutions to give our community a fighting chance. There is only one person in the race willing to do that. To Vice President Biden: keep up the fight. Our children and grandchildren are depending on you to restore, rebuild, and heal our nation.\" NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said Friday\u00a0on CBSN\u00a0that Biden should not assume he has the full support of the African American community during the election. \"You cannot take the African American vote for granted.\" Johnson acknowledged that Biden has significant support in the African American community, but said the presumptive nominee\u00a0should work to maintain that critical support. \"You either win or lose with the support of the African American community,\" he said. JOE BIDEN Biden on Thursday night was pressed on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\"\u00a0 about Senator Amy Klobuchar's chances of making his running mate \"short list.\" Biden responded positively: \"Amy's first rate, don't get me wrong.\" Biden said \"no one's been vetted yet by the team\" but confirmed the initial preliminary outreach to gauge interest is \"coming to an end now.\" For her part,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0says Klobuchar said in a\u00a0WCCO Radio\u00a0interview Friday morning this stated timing from Biden of the vetting process is \"correct\" and that \"you're going to hear a lot of rumors out there.\" She added later, \"I'm not going to talk about this process because I think it is going to be Joe Biden in the end that is going to be the decision maker here.\" \u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP Mr. Trump announced Friday that churches and other houses of worship are \"essential,\" and demanded governors nationwide allow them to reopen \"right now\" amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0Musadiq Bidar\u00a0report. \"Today, I'm identifying houses of worship \u2014 churches, synagogues and mosques \u2014 as essential places that provide essential services,\" Mr. Trump said at a last-minute press conference in the White House Briefing room. The president added if governors do not abide by his recommendation, he will \"override\" them, though, it is not clear by what authority. \"Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's not right. So I'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.\" The President did not take questions from reporters. Following his remarks, White House coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, suggested individuals with comorbidities in high-risk COVID-19 areas may want to \"wait another week\" before visiting their church, mosque or synagogue. Birx urged faith leaders to reach out to local health departments in order to mitigate risks for more vulnerable community members. \"There is a way to social distance in places of worship,\" she told reporters. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called it \"safe\" to reopen churches if done so in accordance with new guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control. The president's call to reopen places of worship coincides with the end of Ramadan. Muslims across the country will celebrate Eid al-Fitr this weekend. On the first morning of Eid, expected this Sunday, Muslims attend morning sermons and prayers in large gatherings at mosques. Some communities, including ones in California's Bay Area, have already planned virtual celebrations. The San Francisco Muslim Community Center is planning for an online sermon, while the Nor Cal Islamic Center has four hours of programming with guest speakers and entertainment scheduled for Sunday morning. Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Georgia on Friday. He was accompanied on Air Force Two by Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia. Among the dignitaries greeting Pence on the tarmac, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar, was Congressman Doug Collins, who is challenging incumbent Loeffler for her Senate seat. Pence had lunch with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp at Star Caf\u00e9 in Northwest Atlanta. Pence shared that he had pulled pork and meatloaf during lunch and added that it was \"a great meal and we are able to do that because of what the people of Georgia have done.\" Pence told reporters that the Trump administration is looking at a phase four stimulus bill and those conversations are \"actively underway.\" Pence said he is \"working in real time\" with lawmakers from both parties to extend paycheck protections, adding \"stay tuned.\" He told the people of Georgia to \"go back to your local hospital, go ahead and have that procedure, go and have that routine check up to support your health and support your local health care community.\" Pence also held a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at Waffle House headquarters to discuss reopening of restaurants in the state. \"We are now in a position to open the country again,\" Pence said during his opening remarks. He added that Georgia is leading the way in that effort. On Wednesday, while he was in Florida, Pence made similar remarks, saying that state is \"setting the pace\" in terms of fighting against the coronavirus. Last month, \u00a0Mr. Trump criticized Kemp for his decision to reopen small business in the state. Mr. Trump at the time said he \"strongly\" opposed Kemp's plans and urged him to wait a bit longer. Now Vice Pence carried a different message from the White House. \"President Trump and I couldn't be more proud or grateful for the clear, courageous, and principled leadership of Governor Brian Kemp,\" Pence said at the roundtable discussion. The vice president told Kemp that what he \"began weeks ago here in Georgia\" has spread to all 50 states who also now have started to reopen their economies. Pence also said a growing economy is what contributes to the physical and emotional well-being of Americans. The Biden campaign suggested Pence's visit to Atlanta is disingenuous. \"Georgians need decisive actions from transparent and empathetic leaders, but instead today they will get a photo-op,\" said Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders. Trump Victory Spokesperson Savannah Viar said \"Georgians knows President Trump and Vice President Pence will always put them first.\" FLORIDA Continuing his swing through battlegrounds states, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar visited Florida on Friday. According to Governor Ron DeSantis' office, he and Azar participated in a tour and roundtable discussion at a Jacksonville health center to highlight their efforts in supporting COVID-19 patients.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that this visit comes as DeSantis has lifted all restrictions on youth activities in the state, which include summer camps and athletics, effective immediately. \"As evidenced by Secretary Azar's visit today, the rest of the country is turning to Florida as an example of how to battle coronavirus and safely re-open without draconian overreach,\" said Trump Victory Spokesperson Emma Vaughn in an emailed statement. \"Thanks to steadfast and nuanced leadership from the Trump Administration and Governor DeSantis to slow the spread of coronavirus, Florida has flattened the curve and we have begun to safely re-open our economy.\" The Biden campaign responded to the visit saying that healthcare workers in Jacksonville \"don't want a photo-op\" with the secretary. \"While we certainly hope Secretary Azar is being truthful when he says 'we are ready to support' Florida as the state reopens, actions \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 speak louder than words,\" said Paige Hill, regional communications director for the Biden campaign, in an emailed statement. \"This administration's botched response has told Floridians all they need to know.\" Mitchell\u00a0also reports that results are in from the Florida Democratic Party's district-level delegate elections that were held electronically last weekend. According to FLDP, nearly 12,000 Democratic voters participated in electing the state's 143 district-level delegates and 13 district-level alternates, who will represent the state at the Democratic National Convention. As previously reported by CBS News,\u00a0uncertainty remains\u00a0surrounding both parties' national conventions scheduled this fall. MICHIGAN All registered Michigan voters\u00a0have been sent\u00a0absentee ballot applications, the Michigan Secretary of State's Office announced Thursday night.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports the move came after two days of national controversy during which Mr. Trump threatened to withhold federal funding over the planned move. \"All people on the list of Michigan registered voters have been mailed an APPLICATION to vote by mail,\" read a\u00a0bulletin\u00a0from the Michigan Department of State. Any Michigan voter was already able to vote by mail after 67% of voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 that allowed \"no-excuse\" absentee voting. Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson\u00a0announced\u00a0on Tuesday that she was going to send absentee ballot request forms to all registered Michigan voters for the August primary and November general elections. The move was thrown into the national spotlight on Wednesday when Mr. Trump, a vocal critic of expanding vote-by-mail,\u00a0threatened to withhold federal money\u00a0to Michigan over the move. While visiting Michigan on Thursday, the president did not say which federal money he was considering holding up. He repeated concerns about fraud from mail voting and said he wants \"good, straight, honest voting.\" Mr. Trump added, \"We don't want to have vote-by-mail.\" On Friday, the ACLU filed a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0challenging the requirement that mail ballots in Michigan have to arrive by the time polls close on Election Day in order to be counted. During Michigan's local elections in May, the lawsuit says 1.75% of ballots arrived after that deadline, and say at that rate thousands of people could be disenfranchised in November. They are asking that all ballots be counted if they are postmarked or have information indicating a ballot was mailed on or before election day, but received up to 6 days later. If the ballot lacks a postmark, or it is illegible, they say ballots that arrive the day after election day should be counted. ASIAN AMERICANS The Asian American Action Fund, a national political action committee focused on electing progressive Asian Americans, sent a letter to Biden urging him to select an Asian American woman, specifically Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois or Senator Kamala Harris of California, as his running mate.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the letter was signed by more than 170 AAPI leaders and organizations. A Pew Research Center report released earlier this month revealed that the Asian American community is the fastest growing electorate in the country. The report showed that more than 11 million Asian Americans will be eligible voters in the 2020 election, representing nearly five percent of the nation's voting population. The Asian American Action Fund's letter states that Duckworth and Harris \"understand the struggles facing AAPI families \u2014 struggles not unlike the struggles of other Americans \u2014 and they know how to advance opportunities for the most vulnerable in our society.\" The letter also pointed to the racist physical and verbal attacks against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, while noting that the Biden campaign has a \"chance to stem the tide of this racist wave in November.\" The letter states \"Despite our contributions to this country, AAPIs are still seen as foreign...We are not represented or recognized at the top levels of power.\" LEGAL MATTERS The Republican National Committee, along with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Party of Florida, has filed a motion to intervene in a Florida lawsuit, where Priorities USA political action committee and others are suing DeSantis. The lawsuit claims in part that the state's election laws violate multiple amendments while challenging the constitutionality of the state's Election Day receipt deadline for mailed ballots. The original complaint was filed on May 4th in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in an emailed statement Thursday evening that Democrats are using the pandemic to \"destroy the integrity\" of elections. \"Their latest attempt to circumvent election law in Florida would allow paid operatives to go door-to-door to collect and deliver thousands of ballots, as well as allow votes to be counted after Election Day,\" said McDaniel in the statement. \"This unnecessarily exposes Florida to potential fraud.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "In between campaign stops on Monday in Arizona, President Trump tore into the nation's leading infectious diseases expert and coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci. Mr. Trump said Fauci is a \"very nice man\" but \"loves being on TV\" and that he has \"made a lot of bad calls,\" according to\u00a0CBS News White House producer Sara Cook. Earlier in the day during an all-hands call with Trump campaign and Republican field staff, Mr. Trump said people have become tired of \"Fauci and all these idiots\" warning about the risks of\u00a0COVID-19. \"People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people, these people that have gotten it wrong,\" the president told his staff Monday during a call on the state-of-play of the race. \"Fauci's a nice guy. He's been here for 500 years. He called every one of them wrong. And he's like this wonderful guy, a wonderful sage, telling us how he said, 'do not wear face masks' -- that's a number of months ago.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, producer Kristin Brown\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0report Mr. Trump said if the White House had listened to Fauci, the U.S. would have \"500,000 deaths.\" The president went on to declare, \"We saved 2.2 million people. If we didn't do what we did, and close it and do just -- now we're opening it. But we'd never close it again. It would never close, it'll never close again. Because we know the disease,\" an apparent reference to his partial ban on travel to the U.S. from China early this year. Since the pandemic began,\u00a0more than 8 million Americans\u00a0have tested positive for\u00a0the coronavirus\u00a0and more than 219,000 have died. At the beginning of the outbreak, Fauci recommended against routinely wearing masks, but that was in part because he was concerned there would be a shortage of surgical masks for healthcare workers. A month later, he reversed course after scientists were finding that people without symptoms were a significant source of spread, and masks, even homemade ones, could help stop transmission. \"It became clear that cloth coverings \u2014 ... and not necessarily a surgical mask or an N95 \u2014 cloth coverings, work. So, now there's no longer a shortage of masks,\" Fauci said in an interview with\u00a0CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jonathan LaPook\u00a0on \"60 Minutes.\" He added that \"meta-analysis studies show that, contrary to what we thought, masks really do work in preventing infection.\" While Fauci has been consistently calling for the use of masks for months, the White House messaging on mask wearing has been less consistent. Mr. Trump and White House officials do not always wear masks, even at crowded events like Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination, which Fauci has called\u00a0a \"super-spreader\" event. He told LaPook that\u00a0he's not surprised\u00a0the president contracted coronavirus given his participation at crowded events where few people wore masks. The president also noted that he's holding big rallies, even as COVID-19 continues to ravage the country. \"People are tired of COVID. I have the biggest rallies I've ever had, and we have COVID. People are saying, 'Whatever, just leave us alone.' They're tired of it,\" the president said. In a radio interview with CBS News affiliate KNX, Fauci responded to Mr. Trump's recent criticism saying he didn't want to distract people with \"me against the president\" but added that he tries to ignore the criticism and focus on his job. Fauci acknowledged the public's fatigue with the pandemic but pledged that \"this will end\", according to\u00a0CBS News radio correspondent and Washington executive editor Steve Dorsey. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was not on the campaign trail on Monday but released a statement saying in part, \"Mr. President, you're right about one thing: the American people are tired. They're tired of your lies about this virus. They're tired of watching more Americans die and more people lose their jobs because you refuse to take this pandemic seriously. Now, more than ever, we need a leader to bring us together, put a plan in place, and beat this virus -- but you have proven yourself yet again to be incapable of doing that.\" On Monday, the president also predicted he's going to win and seemed to suggest he has greater confidence now than he did two or three weeks ago, which was when he contracted the coronavirus and was subsequently hospitalized. \"We're going to win. I wouldn't have said that three weeks ago,\" the president told campaign staff. \"Three weeks ago, two weeks ago, I don't know, I wouldn't have said it. It was tougher for me. But when we're leading in Michigan in the early vote, that's unheard of.\"\u00a0CBS News polling\u00a0shows the president trailing former Vice President Joe Biden nationally, as well as in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien objected to the topics announced for the second and final presidential debate in a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates. Stepien said the topics stray away from the usual devotion of the final debate to foreign policy. He also protested the possibility that an \"unnamed\" person might have the power to cut the mics, something under discussion after Mr. Trump frequently interrupted Biden in the first debate. \"As is long standing custom, and as had been promised by the Commission on Presidential Debates, we had expected that foreign policy would be the central focus of the October 22 debate,\" Stepien said in the letter. \"We urge you to recalibrate the topics and return to subjects which had already been confirmed.\" According to the commission, moderator NBC News' Kristen Welker has chosen the following topics for the upcoming debate: fighting COVID-19, American families, race in America, climate change, national security and leadership. In a statement, the Biden campaign said in a statement to CBS News that the Trump camp is \"lying about that now because Donald Trump is afraid to face more questions about his disastrous COVID response. As usual, the president is more concerned with the rules of a debate than he is getting a nation in crisis the help it needs.\" Vice President Mike Pence held a Make America Great Again rally in Pennsylvania on Monday. It was Pence's second visit in three days to that state and he plans to return this Friday.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports that Vice President Pence will focus on Midwestern battleground states and ramp up his travel schedule in the final two weeks. Pence's chief of staff Marc Short told reporters Monday morning that the VP will maintain an \"aggressive\" travel schedule with five to six days on the road and two to three rallies each day. \"Voters saw in 2016 when the President and Vice President were traveling all over the country and working really hard and I think voters can appreciate the energy and excitement that they brought to the trail,\" Short said. \"So that's what we're going to be doing again these last couple of weeks,\" he added. Pence, who held a rally in Maine on Monday morning before dashing to Pennsylvania, will travel to New Hampshire, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Florida the rest of the week. Short said Pence's closing argument will focus on trade, economy, and the confirmation hearings of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Pence previewed that closing argument in Maine on Monday, where his attacks on Biden focused heavily on contrasting economic policies. \"You gotta ask yourself, you gotta ask your neighbors and friends, who do you think is going to bring this economy back and then some?\" Pence said. He went on to describe Biden as a career politician who supported a policy of \"economic surrender\" to China while framing Trump as a \"proven job creator.\" Pence said, \"It's a choice between a Trump recovery and Biden depression.\" He added, \"There's a booming recovery that's already begun,\" he added. Pence also attacked Biden on court packing and claimed the Democratic ticket wants to pack the courts with liberal activist judges. While talking about the Administration's success in confirming more than 200 judges to the federal bench, Pence said \"Donald Trump and I are not gonna let big tech block the truth, we aren't going to let big tech censor what Americans read or see or say in this election or ever.\" Pence said for three years Democrats have throwing everything but the kitchen sink at Trump, but he was fought back every day. He urged supporters to go fight for Trump now by encouraging them to vote. Pence was in Maine partly because the campaign believes it can win the second congressional district and earn one of Maine's four electoral votes. \"Congressional district number two, as you know, there's a couple of different scenarios where that individual elector vote could become important,\" Short told reporters. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris returned to the campaign trail Monday, her first venture back on the road since a member of her campaign staff tested positive for COVID-19 on October 14.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports that Harris campaigned in Florida as the state begins early voting Monday and began her day in Orlando at an early vote launch drive- in rally. Harris appeared energized while speaking to the crowd of supporters, many of whom watched her speak from the insides of their cars. The crowd erupted in cheers and honked their car horns when Harris said, \"We know we need a change, and a change is coming!\" During her remarks Harris spoke about the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Harris claimed that the president \"lied to the American people,\" about the deadliness of the virus and failed to disclose as soon as he knew that the virus was airborne. She also previewed this week's upcoming debate between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden saying, \"As, per usual, you can rely on Donald Trump to engage distortions and basically lie to the American people. So let's be clear about this: Joe Biden will not increase taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year, period.\" Home to some of America's biggest and longest-running retirement communities in the Phoenix area, there are few other battleground states where seniors could play a larger role in determining the outcome of 2020 than in Arizona, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. In 2016, exit polls reported one-in-four voters in the battleground state were 65 and over, the biggest share of all the states\u00a0now considered toss-ups\u00a0this year. This year, early voting data analyzed by\u00a0Arizona data firm OH Predictive Insights\u00a0ranks 65 and older voters as by far the largest return rate of all age groups in Maricopa County since early voting kicked off in Arizona nearly two weeks ago. Precincts spanning \"active retired adult\" neighborhoods of the county have long voted Republican by wide margins. These older voters broke in the president's favor by double digits four years ago, supporting then-candidate Trump 55% to Hillary Clinton's 42% in exit polls. Now a CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0released Sunday\u00a0shows Joe Biden trailing President Trump by just 6 points among these Arizona voters, far narrower than his double digit lead in our\u00a0Battleground Tracker\u00a0one month ago of the state. For months polls have shown the president\u00a0both leading\u00a0and\u00a0losing among older voters\u00a0in Arizona, even over just the past week. But our Battleground Tracker showed 0% of Arizona voters over 65 said they might or probably would change their vote, setting up a battle for turnout in these final weeks of the election among this coveted demographic. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien announced Monday in a call with reporters that the campaign and Republican National Committee will be spending a combined $55 million in paid advertising in the final two weeks of the race. RNC-created TV ads messaging senior citizens in statewide markets will be launched across Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. But the Biden campaign last month grossly out-fundraised the president's reelection bid, raking in $383 million to the Republicans' $248 million, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"Joe Biden is putting it all on TV,\" Stepien said on a call with reporters, Thursday. \"That's his choice, that's his strategy.\" He later added, \"We have lots of TV ads in the president's favor. But in addition to that, we're actually running a real campaign, a national campaign - a campaign with voter contacts, a campaign with events, a campaign with surrogates, a campaign with voter registration drives. We like our plan better.\" And while Trump campaign operatives concede the president is largely defending the 2016 map,\u00a0Sganga\u00a0reports that aides also aim to flip Minnesota and Nevada. \"Minnesota hasn't been won [by Republicans] since 1972. But we're getting good numbers. We'll give it a shot,\" Mr. Trump declared to his campaign staff on a conference call on Thursday. \"You know, we're gonna give it a shot. I think we have a real chance,\" Stepien told staffers on the same call, \"If election were held today, the President would win Nevada,\" Stepien told staffers on the same call. Campaign operatives say they're targeting blue collar workers in the state, second amendment voters and Hispanic men, particularly around the Reno market. CBS News' Elections Unit rates both Minnesota and Nevada as \"lean Democrat\" states. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, a Democrat and frequent Biden campaign surrogate, pleaded with the Trump campaign\u00a0in a letter\u00a0late last week to do \"everything in its capability to ensure that our local ordinances are respected and followed during your event\" and reminding the president that his campaign has \"$80,000 in outstanding expenses owed to the city from a 2016 rally,\" reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Mr. Trump's planned visit to Arizona earlier this month was upended after he contracted COVID-19. Local authorities said before that trip that \"constitutionally protected activities\" are exempted from COVID-19 restrictions in the battleground state under Arizona's health order. Monday is the last day to register to vote online or by mail in California, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. After Monday, voters in the state can still register but have to do so at an in-person voting location. California also offers same-day registration, so voters can still register and vote on Election Day if they visit a voting center or county elections office. Nearly 85% of all eligible voters in California were registered to vote as of early September. That's the highest percentage of voters in the state registered for a general election in 68 years. More than 21 million have signed up to vote and as of Monday morning and more than 3.7 million have already returned their vote-by-mail ballots, according to the secretary of state's office. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that on the first day of early voting in Florida, poll watchers say long lines at one early voting site in Leon County is an indicator that people want to ensure their votes are counted. The capital city, Tallahassee, is the county seat of Leon County, where 31,857 voters have already voted by mail. Neil Mooney, an attorney in Tallahassee, said he decided to vote on the first day of early voting in the state to ensure his vote was counted. \"I could have voted by mail because I had a ballot but I decided not to because I was concerned about it being rejected, mainly matching signatures and things like that,\" said Mooney. \"So I thought I should just come in person and see it counted which I did do, I saw it counted.\" Lesa Crosby-Harley, a retired seasoned poll worker, said that because she normally helps manage polls, this year is the first time she's been able to vote in person in 25 years. \"It feels strange really because I feel like I should be working, but it's a privilege. It's an honor. I don't take it lightly,\" said Crosby-Harley. \"It's something that people died for, some people don't have rights and I thank God that I do have rights, and I do want my voice heard, and I want to make sure that my ballot is counted.\"\u00a0CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez\u00a0reported\u00a0on \"CBS This Morning\"\u00a0that in North Miami, voters stood in line for hours in unpleasant weather to cast their ballots Monday morning. A spokesperson for the Florida Department of State said that county supervisors of elections provide vote-by-mail and early voting activity report files to the Florida Division of Elections once a day reflecting activity up through the previous day and that early voting estimates aren't available from their office at this time. Iowa state auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat, issued a report with the Treasury Department's Inspector General on Monday that advised Republican Governor Kim Reynolds that she misused millions of dollars of CARES Act money, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The report said Reynolds' decision to use \"millions of CARES Act dollars to help implement a new software system for state government was not an allowable use of the funds. They directed her to return those dollars to the Coronavirus Relief Fund, and then redeploy them for allowable uses.\" This deals with the decision to spend $21 million on Workday, an HR/accounting computer system. Sand said that the expenditures were not \"due to the public health emergency\" since Iowa signed the contract in 2019, \"prior to the emergence of COVID-19.\" According to the report, Reynolds' office has justified the expense by saying, \"with Workday, the State of Iowa will be able to act quickly to assist essential government employees, giving them flexibility in a number of ways, such as requesting COVID-related hardship help, easier ways to request Family and Medical Leave Act leave types, and automate processes for donating leave, and borrowing leave.\" Sand also advised that it was \"questionable\" to use CARES Act money for her personal staff and could lead to repayments being required. This covered $448,449 worth of payments. The report said that salaries can qualify for funding \"only when certain conditions are met\" and \"the work the governor's staff are doing that is directly related to the pandemic must be tracked separately from their ordinary work, and supported with appropriate documentation.\" CBS News has reached out to Reynolds' office for a response. Counties in Nevada kicked off counting votes on Monday, with\u00a0nearly half of\u00a0mail ballots already returned by both Democrats and Republicans in the state and a rush of early in-person voting drawing long lines at some polling locations in the battleground state over the weekend, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Nevada is among the states counting ballots earlier this year, a move that could mitigate delays in reporting results on Election Night. Neighboring Arizona allows counties to begin counting ballots Tuesday, where a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0over the weekend reported\u00a0the vast majority of Biden's supporters have already voted by mail. \"Early voting is underway. So get out and vote,\" Mr. Trump urged supporters in Northern Nevada on Sunday, rallying in the state's capital Carson City. \"And they're getting a little worried because certain areas, we know we're going to have a big red wave.\" In a\u00a0video clip\u00a0posted by NBC affiliate WRAL of North Carolina Democratic Governor Roy Cooper greeting Biden during his visit to North Carolina Sunday, Cooper is heard telling the Democratic presidential candidate that he believes Democratic Senate candidate Cal Cunningham will \"get across the line\" despite recent revelations of Cunningham having an extramarital affair. \"And I think we're going to all get across the line,\" Cooper said to Biden in the clip. \"I think Cal's going to get across the line too. I know that's frustrating but we'll get it, we'll get it across.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this month that the North Carolina Senate race had been upended in part because Democratic Senate candidate Cal Cunningham admitted to exchanging sexually suggestive texts with a political strategists that is not his wife. CBS News reached out to Governor Roy Cooper's campaign for a response to the revelation of his remarks to Biden on Sunday. In a statement Monday, North Carolina Republican Party press secretary Tim Wigginton said Cunningham's scandal reflects negatively on Democrats in the battleground state. \"Cal Cunningham's sex scandal is dragging down Democrats statewide and it's no wonder that Roy Cooper called Cunningham's misconduct 'frustrating' and that Biden wasn't campaigning with him,\" said Wigginton in a statement. \"Members of Cunningham's own party are distancing themselves from him because they know his affair has exposed his campaign as one big lie.\" TEXAS A 5th Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Monday reinstated Texas' laws for when voters have to be notified that their ballot is rejected due to a mismatched signature, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Texas law requires voters to be notified that their absentee ballot was rejected because of a signature mismatch within 10 days after an election and the law does not require giving voters a chance to challenge the rejection. A district court judge issued an injunction last month, saying Texas couldn't discard ballots because of mismatching signatures unless there was a faster timeline for notifying voters about that rejection. Monday's decision from the 5th Circuit puts a hold on that decision from the lower court. \"In a well-intentioned but sweeping order issued less than two months before the election, however, the district court minimizes Texas' interest in preserving the integrity of its elections and takes it upon itself to rewrite the Legislature's mail-in ballot signature-verification and voter-notification procedures,\" Judge Jerry Smith wrote. \"Because Texas's strong interest in safeguarding the integrity of its elections from voter fraud far outweighs any burden the state's voting procedures place on the right to vote, we stay the injunction pending appeal.\" Officials in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, in the northeastern part of the state, are warning that an issue with ballots could delay how long it takes to count votes, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. In a letter to the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC), Outagamie County's Deputy Corporation Counsel said machines have failed to record votes on affected ballots due to an issue on the ballots' margins. There is not an issue with any of the candidates on the ballots, but a mark near the edge of the ballot is causing the error. The issue was not discovered when officials initially tested ballots and only arose after ballots were distributed for absentee voting. Officials believe there are at least 5,500 ballots affected by this issue and \"likely many more.\" Ballots are being replaced before early in-person voting starts tomorrow. The letter warns that if election officials have to duplicate the affected ballot, they may not be able to count all affected ballots by 4:00pm the day after the election. Officials asked the Wisconsin Elections Commission to extend the deadline for local clerks to report results to county clerks and to hand count \"only the rejectable absentee ballots rather than duplicating the ballots,\" unless a county believes that that would be more efficient. The WEC meets Tuesday and will discuss the issue. POLLING The suburban shift away from Mr. Trump is showing in internal Democrat polls released Monday, while notable Republican challengers are beginning to close their own gaps reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. A\u00a0New York Times/Siena College poll\u00a0from October 15 showed Mr. Trump up 8 points in the state overall. In Houston, an internal poll for Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni shows him leading Republican Troy Nehls by 5 points for the open race in Texas' 22nd district. It also has Biden leading Mr. Trump by 9 points in a district the president won by 8 points. Another dramatic swing is shown in an internal Democrat poll for Minnesota's 2nd district, which includes suburbs of the Twin Cities. The internal poll shows a 16 point lead for Biden in a seat Mr. Trump won by 1 point. The poll was\u00a0mainly conducted to gauge how voters feel\u00a0about a postponed special election due to the death of Legal Marijuana Now candidate Adam Weeks. State law requires a special election to be called after the death of a major party candidate, but a federal judge ruled in October against a special election (set in February) and that votes should be counted on November 3. The ruling has been appealed. The poll found that while very few (14%) have been keeping up with the legal challenges, when asked, 72% preferred to have the election results in November count rather than have a special election. The poll also finds Democratic incumbent Angie Craig leading by 18 points against Republican challenger Tyler Kistner for a seat she flipped the seat by 5 points in 2018. In South Carolina's 1st district, Republican Nancy Mace is shown up 2 points in a\u00a0poll conducted by her campaign. It also shows Mr. Trump leading Biden by 3 points in the Charleston-area district he won by 13 points in 2016. Lastly, an independent Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics\u00a0poll\u00a0shows Utah's 4th district race at a virtual tie, with Republican Burgess Owens leading Congressman Ben McAdams 46% to 45%. In September, the same pollster had McAdams up 4 but the latest fundraising quarter did have Owens out raising the incumbent and with more cash on hand.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court reaffirmed abortion protections on Monday, striking down a Louisiana abortion restriction that, if allowed to be implemented, could have made the state the first to be without a legal abortion provider since Roe v. Wade,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0reporter Kate Smith\u00a0reports. The decision \u2014 with Chief Justice John Roberts concurring with the court's four-member liberal minority \u2014 is the court's first major abortion rights decision since two Trump appointees took the bench, delivering a major win to abortion rights supporters who've been concerned about the court's new ideological makeup and how that would impact the future of abortion access. Thursday's 138-page decision, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, found Louisiana's restriction \u2014 which requires doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital \u2014 violated precedent set in the 2016 Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt ruling, a case that dealt with a nearly identical regulation in Texas. The Trump campaign referred to today's decision as \"disappointing to say the least,\" according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0In a statement, deputy communications director Ali Pardo wrote in part, \"Five unelected Supreme Court Justices decided to insert their political agenda in place of democratically determined policies. This case underscores the importance of re-electing President Trump, who has a record of appointing conservative judges, rather than Joe Biden, who will appoint radical, activist judges who will legislate from the courts.\" In a statement, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden said the decision \"reaffirmed that states cannot put in place laws that unduly burden a women's right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports that Biden said he plans to codify Roe v. Wade and that his Justice Department would work to stop state laws that \"blatantly violate a woman's protected, constitutional right to choose.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden's campaign has released diversity statistics for his campaign, according to\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0The Biden campaign says 35% of full time staffers are people of color and 36% of full time senior staff are people of color. The majority of both the overall full time staff (53%) and the full time senior staff (58%) are women. Senior staff includes people running departments, senior advisers, deputy campaign managers and senior consultants who spend most of their time on the campaign. The campaign did not release detailed statistics on its employees by race or ethnicity.\u00a0 The campaign is working with Inclusv, which works to ensure people of color are found at every level of politics. On Saturday, Biden was pressed about the diversity of his campaign during a town hall hosted by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. \"My administration is going to look like America. Not just my staff, the administration, from the vice president straight down through cabinet members to major players within the White House and the court,\" Biden said. \"It's going to be a reflection of who we are as a nation.\" According to a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, a majority of full time staff members (52%) and senior staff members (56%) are women.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports people of color represent just 25% of senior staff members across the campaign. According to the spokesperson, the percentage of persons of color serving as full time staff members is \"not available.\" PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeatedly denied that President Trump was briefed on reported intelligence that Russian military intelligence offered cash payments to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops and coalition forces in Afghanistan,\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn\u00a0reports. \"There was not a consensus among the intelligence community,\" McEnany told reporters at Monday's White House press briefing. \"In fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community, and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified.\" McEnany was pressed on why Mr. Trump did not receive a briefing on the intelligence about the Russian operation, reported over the weekend by the New York Times and the Washington Post, and repeatedly told reporters the intelligence in question has not been verified.\u00a0 \"This was not briefed up to the president because it was not, in fact, verified,\" she said. National security council spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement Sunday, \"The veracity of the underlying allegations continues to be evaluated.\" In an explosive report published Friday, the New York Times said U.S. intelligence officials concluded a Russian military spy unit offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for the killing of coalition forces in Afghanistan. According to the Times report, Mr. Trump was briefed on the finding, and White House officials developed options for addressing the matter. The Washington Post subsequently reported the Russian operation Saturday, citing U.S. officials who said Trump administration leaders learned of the cash payments in recent months from U.S. intelligence agencies. On the campaign side, the president's re-election team is suing the Pennsylvania Department of State and the boards of elections in all 67 counties for allegedly \"hazardous, hurried, and illegal implementation of unmonitored mail-in voting\" during the state's June 2nd primary, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0\u00a0Filed within federal court in Pittsburgh, Monday, the suit condemns Governor Tom Wolf's order to extend the deadline for absentee voting in a handful of counties during Pennsylvania's primary election. The case also alleges a handful of Pennsylvania counties broke state law by creating insecure ballot drop boxes for the primary elections, fell short of ensuring ballots were mailed to correct addresses, and enforces a too strict residency requirement for poll watchers. Today's lawsuit comes as part of a $10 million legal investment by the Trump campaign in \"protecting election integrity,\" which aims to clamp down on state elections changes made in light of COVID-19.\u00a0 The RNC and California GOP sued California Governor Gavin Newsom in May, in an attempt to block his decision to send absentee ballots to voters for the general election. National and state committees have also filed lawsuits in Florida, Nevada and Wisconsin, among others, to block Democratic efforts to ease absentee ballot restrictions. Meanwhile on a conference call with governors across the country, Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. is a \"better place than we were two months ago,\" but added that recent progress does not minimize the developments occurring in the Sun Belt,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports. As the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise and some states begin to roll back the reopening of their economies, Pence reassured governors that the federal government is ready to provide assistance. Dr. Deborah Birx, joining the call from New Mexico, said that Texas and Arizona are \"significant hotspots\" with increasing positivity in New Mexico, according to audio of the call obtained by\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman. She also said they are monitoring slow upticks in Ohio, Madison, Wisconsin and Knoxville, Tennessee.\u00a0 \"We would like to work with those mayors and governors to really deploy some new testing techniques\u2026to really test large populations at the community level,\" Birx said. \"Although our mortality continues to decline week over week, we believe this week it will stabilize with the potential of going back up if we don't intervene comprehensively now,\" she added.\" Significantly, Dr. Birx noted that this wave is different, noting many of the cases are individuals under the age of 40.\u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci said the message to young people needs to be that they are part of a dynamic to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19. Fauci added, \"We don't want to go back to shut down. We want to let the public health process be the vehicle to opening up, not the obstacle to opening up.\" Fauci attributed Memorial Day celebrations, not seeing a jump in cases, and getting relaxed about their behavior, to contributing to the rise in cases in Texas.\u00a0 He says that just because a week goes by and they don't see consequences, \"that doesn't mean there are not going to be consequences.\" Pence told the nation's governors that the national stockpile is now in a much better position than it was in March and added that in the next seven days the U.S. will have a stockpile of 50,000 ventilators. Pence shared the \"encouraging news\" that while they've seen a rise in positivity rates among younger age groups, \"there have been states where we haven't seen a precipitous rise of positivity rates among seniors.\"\u00a0 Mr. Pence encouraged governors to motivate patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan pleaded with Pence to push for a compromise in Congress towards a new stimulus relief package. He told Pence that governors will have to take \"drastic\" actions that could result in millions of jobs cut if they don't receive another $500 billion in funding for state and local governments. Pence said the president is in favor of that and the bill would be \"given consideration\" in Congress in mid-July. Pence also said the president would like to see a \"payroll tax cut\" and urged governors to advocate for that as well.\u00a0 VEEPSTAKES TAMMY DUCKWORTH VoteVets, a liberal veterans' group, released a video pushing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to select Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth as his running mate according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The video highlighted Duckworth's military background and suggested she can win over new voters.\u00a0 The narrator in the video says, \"Tammy Duckworth opens doors to new voters, winning swing voters and sweeping to victory in the Midwest, the same year Trump was elected.\" In an interview with MSNBC, Duckworth was asked if she is in the process of answering questions from Biden's vice presidential vetting committee. \"I mean, I answer questions all the time,\" Duckworth answered. \"So, at this point, the vetters, you know, they've got the whole process at the Biden camp. I'm not going to interfere with that.\" GRETCHEN WHITMER Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her support for more law enforcement reforms on Monday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Whitmer said she wants to ban chokeholds and windpipe blockage, further limit the use of no-knock warrants and classify false, racially-motivated 911 calls as a hate crime. She's also proposing providing incentives for law enforcement agencies to hire and retain officers who live in communities where they work. In addition she is calling for requiring independent investigations of all shootings and use of force incidents that result in the death of unarmed civilians at the hands of law enforcement.\u00a0 \"All Michiganders, no matter their community or the color of their skin, deserve equal treatment under the law,\" Whitmer said in a statement. Earlier this month Whitmer said she wants law enforcement agencies to implement \"duty to intervene\" policies when one officer observes another doing something inappropriate or illegal. She also voiced support for a bill that would require training on implicit bias, de-escalation techniques and mental health screenings. LIFE AFTER 2020 ANDREW YANG Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang said in a Time100 Talks interview that he has had \"general conversations\" with Joe Biden about potentially joining a cabinet position in the former VP's administration. Asked if President Donald Trump's racially charged rhetoric will impact the country after he leaves office,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports Yang answered that Biden can unite and heal the country. \"We all know that Trump's racially divisive rhetoric has been part of the problem, not the solution,\" Yang added. \"Right now, we're all desperate for a better approach. And I believe Joe Biden is going to be the person that leads this country over the next number of years to begin the healing process.\" CONVENTIONAL WISDOM MASK MANDATE The city of Jacksonville announced a new mask mandate Monday but would not say how it would be enforced ahead of the upcoming Republican National Convention, reports\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. \"That event is over 60 days away so we'll consider to consult with health care experts,\" said Jordan Elsbury, chief of staff for Mayor Lenny Curry. The new order requires residents to wear a mask in public and indoor spaces as well as places where individuals cannot social distance. City officials say they made the decision after speaking with local health providers.\u00a0 Over the weekend, nearly 200 doctors issued an open letter to Mayor Curry and the city council suggesting the RNC be postponed or reduced in size. It stated: \"It is extremely dangerous and contrary to current public health recommendations to stage a large event in an area where the number of cases are surging. \" The letter estimates more than 40,000 people could attend the convention at Jacksonville's Vystar Veterans Memorial Area in August. It also encouraged mask-wearing and social distancing. Asked if President Trump would reconsider wearing a mask in light of the mandate, the White House said it is \"a personal choice.\" Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, \"It's his choice to wear mask.\" She added, \"He encourages people to make whatever decision is best for them and their safety but he did say to me, he has no problem with a mask and to do whatever your local jurisdiction requested.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER \"TIP YOUR CAP\" Four former presidents are \"tipping\" their caps to honor the 100th anniversary of the Negro Leagues, according to\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. Presidents Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter posted social media videos Monday in support of a campaign to recognize the contributions of Black baseball players from 1920-1960. \"Here's to Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell and everybody else, including three brave women who did us all proud,\" Obama saluted.\u00a0 Former President Bush said his favorite player \"as a kid\" was Willie Mays. \"It turns out Willie Mays played in the Negro Leagues for a brief period of time. I can just imagine what baseball would have been like had the predecessors to Willie Mays been able to play Major League Baseball,\" Bush recollected. Former President Clinton tipped his Chicago Cubs hat in honor of Ernie Banks while President Carter said he is thankful the \"era of segregated leagues is long over.\" The virtual tribute was organized by the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in collaboration with baseball legend Hank Aaron and Rachel Robinson, widow of Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to integrate Major League Baseball. Derek Jeter, Reggie Jackson, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Billie Jean King were among the many athletes and celebrities who also \"tipped\" their caps. The campaign encourages all Americans to submit posts, using the hashtag #tipyourcap2020, that will be featured on the museum's website. STATE-BY-STATE CALIFORNIA Bars across seven counties in California, including Los Angeles \u2013 the state's most populous county \u2013 have been ordered to close once again due to a spike in COVID-19 cases, Governor Gavin Newsom said. Additionally,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports California is recommending that bars in eight counties, including Sacramento, close right away.\u00a0 Newsom said the state will be \"stepping up\" the enforcement of health orders through punitive regulatory measures for business and holding back funds from counties. The state has put out more than 30 sectorial guidelines for business to safely reopen. Newsom said \"it is incumbent upon all of us in the state of California to take seriously these rules and these regulations and to enforce them.\" The governor reiterated his\u00a0threat from last week\u00a0that he will withhold up to $2.5 billion in funds from counties if they are not complying with health guidelines, including the state's mandatory order to wear masks. \"If people are flaunting those rules and regulations, or disregarding or throwing out those guidelines, we want to continue to work with our county officials and local officials to help us enforce that,\" Newsom said. He added that is why the state put aside $2.5 billion as part of the budget to \"encourage\" safer health behaviors. \"We've got the tools, capacity to do more effective community enforcement and again, we are going to be doing just that,\" Newsom said. There has been a 45% increase in positive tests over the last week in California, Newsom said. He noted that some of that has to do increased testing.\u00a0 Yesterday, the state tested a record number of more than 100,000 people. But the positivity rate, which climbed from under 5% to 5.5% \"is very concerning,\" Newsom said. A more accurate benchmark than positive tests is the rate of hospitalizations, which is up 43% and ICU bed occupancy, which is also up 37% over the last few weeks. The California governor stressed that the state has the health care capacity to deal with the new spike. There are currently 4,776 individuals with COVID-19 symptoms in California hospitals. Another 42,895 beds are filled patients admitted for other health concerns, leaving the state with about 30,000 open beds in the state in case the coronavirus surge continues. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE SENATE COLORADO One of the top targets for Democrats in the Senate this cycle is Colorado where former governor John Hickenlooper and former State House Speaker Andrew Romanoff will face off on Tuesday for a chance to take on Sen. Cory Gardner in November, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0Hickenlooper has received endorsements from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, national Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and several of the candidates who were in the race before Hickenlooper entered in September.\u00a0 But Romanoff has been pushing forward in recent weeks with some additional help from Republican attacks on Hickenlooper. Earlier in June, Hickenlooper did not appear at a virtual ethics hearing to testify about taking private flights while governor. He testified the next day, and the commission ultimately determined he violated the gift ban. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee has latched onto this in their Colorado ads. The Denver Post Editorial Board\u00a0wrote that\u00a0Hickenlooper made an avoidable error in refusing to testify but ultimately said, \"We don't believe Hickenlooper was trying to undermine the system, or disrespect the commission, or avoid accountability.\"",

            "article_content": "As the impeachment trial of President Trump gets underway, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of seven managers prosecuting the case, said some intelligence agencies have \"stopped cooperating\" with an ongoing investigation in the House, possibly \"on the instruction of others.\" \"We have requested intelligence, relevant intelligence, concerning Ukraine as a part of our oversight responsibility,\" Schiff said when asked what evidence his committee is requesting. \"The intelligence agencies \u2014 some of them have stopped cooperating. And it's our understanding they're doing this on the instructions of others, or with the advice of others.\" Schiff said information about Ukraine's reaction to the pressure campaign by Trump allies in 2019 \"would be very pertinent\" and should be handed over to investigators. \"If there was more evidence that bears on that question and it's being withheld by the intelligence community at the urging of the president, that is a corruption of the intelligence community,\" Schiff said. Schiff spoke to \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell, along with three other impeachment managers: Representatives Val Demings, Zoe Lofgren and Jason Crow. The trial is just the third time in U.S. history that a president has faced removal from office. Portions of O'Donnell's conversation with Schiff, Demings, Lofgren and Crow appear below: Representative Val Demings: I expect not only Leader McConnell, but every member of the Senate, who's taken two oaths, their oath when they were sworn into office and the oath of impartiality, I expect them to take those oaths very seriously and do their job.\u00a0 We want a fair trial.   Representative Zoe Lofgren: When the senators swore impartial justice, they swore to God that they would give impartial justice. And I think that should mean something to them. O'Donnell:\u00a0Chairman, is your committee still investigating? And are you hoping to introduce new evidence during this trial?\u00a0 Schiff: We are still investigating. And new evidence has continued to come to light. And if the senators don't allow witnesses, they'll be the first in history to prohibit them.\u00a0 O'Donnell: You are now accusing the National Security Agency of withholding critical intelligence that could be useful in this impeachment trial. What specific intelligence or intercepts are you looking for? Schiff: We have requested intelligence, relevant intelligence concerning Ukraine as a part of our oversight responsibility. The intelligence agencies, some of them have stopped cooperating. And it's our understanding they're doing this on the instructions of others or with the advice of others. O'Donnell:\u00a0What is it that you don't feel like you have and that you need? Schiff: The issue of how Ukraine has responded to the pressure campaign would be very pertinent. If there was more evidence that bears on that question and it's being withheld by the intelligence community at the urging of the president, that is a corruption of the intelligence community. Demings: The evidence against the president is overwhelming. But the American people deserve to have the complete story. O'Donnell:\u00a0Would you acknowledge that even if you were to succeed in calling John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, that the president could claim executive privilege? Schiff:\u00a0that privilege, even if one could be asserted, would have to be asserted narrowly. Representative Jason Crow: We also have to look-- look at the big picture of all the arguments that the president and his team are making. They're saying that the president can't be indicted. Then they're arguing that the House can't call witnesses and ask for documents. Now they're saying that the president can assert executive privilege over anything that he wants. So if you piece all of those arguments together, it leads to the inevitable conclusion that the president cannot be held accountable and is above the law. And I'm very confident that that's not what the framers intended. O'Donnell: The White House says you failed to allege any crime or violation of the law. What's the crime? Schiff:\u00a0Indeed when the Constitution was written, there really weren't a host of federal crimes. Those came later. What they had in mind was crimes against the body politic. The abuse of power here was the withholding of military aid to an ally at war to help the president cheat in the next election. As one of the Constitutional experts testified, \"If that's not impeachable, nothing is.\" O'Donnell: The president's legal team says he did not obstruct Congress because he acted with \"extraordinary and unprecedented transparency by declassifying and releasing those call summaries.\" Lofgren: He has not released a single document. He tried to obstruct every single member of the administration from appearing before the Congress responding to this abuse. This has never before happened in the history of the United States. Schiff: You really have to give them credit for nerve though, Norah. The argument really boils down to this in their answer. \"We have to obstruct the Congress to protect the Congress. We have to subvert the Constitution to save the Constitution. We have to violate our national security to further our national security.\" Those are absurdist arguments but those are the ones that they're making. Demings: And let us remember, the release of the call record was not about transparency. The release of the call record was about being caught. And he had no choice but to release the record. And then tried to defend what was indefensible.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The death of civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis on Friday has resurrected calls from congressional Democrats for the Senate to take up legislation that seeks to bolster voting rights and roll back the impacts of a Supreme Court decision that gutted a key part of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. For House Democrats, Senate action on the long-stalled measures is an apt way to honor the legacy of Lewis, who represented Georgia in the House for more than three decades and endured violence and arrest in the fight for voting rights. \"One of the best ways that we could honor him is to make sure that the Voting Rights Act passed, that is sitting over in the Senate and has been there for over 200 days,\" Congresswoman Karen Bass, a California Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said Sunday in an interview with ABC's \"This Week.\" The suggestion was echoed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" on Monday, during which the California Democrat said \"one way\" to pay homage to Lewis is for \"the Senate to pass the Voting Rights Act and name it for John Lewis.\" \"That would be a very appropriate way to honor him almost immediately,\" Pelosi said. Congressional efforts to restore voter protections were sparked by the 2013 decision from the Supreme Court in the case Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a central portion of the Voting Rights Act that required states and counties with a history of race-based voter discrimination, mostly in the South, to receive federal approval, referred to as \"preclearance,\" before changing its voting procedures and laws. In its 5-4 decision, the court invalidated Section 4 of the civil rights-era law, which outlined the formula that determined which states or localities had to receive clearance from federal authorities before implementing changes to their voting processes.\u00a0 But the court did not foreclose future congressional action to allow for federal oversight, though it said another formula must be \"based on current conditions.\" \"Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. In the wake of the 2013 decision, some states subject to the preclearance requirement before the Supreme Court's ruling have moved to enact more stringent voting laws, while others have severely cut the number of polling places available, moves civil rights groups argue are intended to disenfranchise Black voters.\u00a0 Texas, for example, announced within 24 hours of the high court's ruling its voter ID law would take effect, while Mississippi and Alabama also enforced similar measures that were previously prohibited due to federal preclearance, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. After the midterm elections, the Leadership Conference on Human & Civil Rights found that there were 1,173 fewer polling places in 2018 than in 2014, although voter turnout had increased. In an effort to remedy the Supreme Court's decision, Democrats made strengthening voting rights a key campaign promise of the 2018 midterm elections and quickly unveiled a far-reaching election reform bill after retaking control of the House in January 2019.\u00a0The bill, known as H.R. 1, passed along party lines in March 2019. It included measures to expand early voting, create same-day voter registration, save eligible voters from being purged from the rolls and create a pathway for re-enfranchisement for those who have lost voting privileges due to felony convictions. The bill also would make Election Day a holiday for federal workers.\u00a0But the proposal was repeatedly slammed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called it a \"power grab\" by Democrats and has refused to bring it to a vote on the Senate floor.\u00a0The House also passed a bill in December \u2014 with support from a lone Republican \u2014 to require federal oversight of elections for certain state and local jurisdictions that have a history of voting rights violations, essentially reversing the effects of the 2013 Supreme Court decision. Lewis sat in the chair to gavel in the final vote for the legislation, the Voting Rights Advancement Act.\u00a0On Sunday, Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who wrote the Senate version of the measure, said he plans to reintroduce the bill and name it for Lewis.\u00a0But the White House has threatened to veto the bill, and it's unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.\u00a0In a statement of administration policy issued ahead of the House vote in December, the White House said the new coverage formula and transparency obligations detailed in the bill \"raise serious policy concerns because the federal government would be granted excessive control over state and local election practices.\"\u00a0While McConnell has honored Lewis and his work in the fight for civil rights and as a public servant, the Kentucky Republican has not addressed whether he would move the Democrats' legislation bolstering voting protections. Instead, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last week, he rebuffed concerns about voter suppression.\u00a0\"There's very little tangible evidence of this whole voter-suppression nonsense that the Democrats are promoting,\" he told the Wall Street Journal. \"My prediction is African-American voters will turn out in as large a percentage as whites, if not more so, all across the country.\"\u00a0\u00a0Still, the pressure on Senate Republicans to revisit the Voting Rights Act in the wake of Lewis's death continues to grow.\u00a0\u00a0\"The best thing that Senate Republicans can do to honor the legacy, service, sacrifice and sincerity of Congressman Lewis is to pass that Voting Rights Act bill,\" Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said.\u00a0Remembering Lewis on the Senate floor on Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the \"law he nearly died for has been gutted by the Supreme Court.\"\u00a0\"Congress has the power to restore it,\" the New York Democrat said, \"but only one political party seems interested in doing so.\"",

            "article_content": "Ohio is a state that has an uncanny ability to pick presidents. For the last 14 presidential elections, the winner of Ohio has also taken the White House \u2014 including 2016, when President Trump narrowly won over Hillary Clinton. The purple state could be poised to flip again in 2020, with CBS News' battleground tracker poll showing the president essentially tied with his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. From what \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil saw, Ohio voters in Wood County, just outside of Toledo, do not take their responsibility lightly. \"I've been trying to do as much research as I could going in and I was looking forward to it,\" Ohio voter Yarin Mercer said of the upcoming election.\u00a0 Mercer spoke to CBS News at an early voting location. Across the U.S., issues like the economy and the coronavirus pandemic have played main roles during this election cycle \u2014 for some Ohioans heading to the polls early, the issues take on a personal role. \"I'm still very scared to go into a post-Trump America in my career field,\" Mercer said. As part of a family that has served in law enforcement for five generations, Mercer plans to continue the legacy, but also worries that the country they are living in and the country that their \"family has served for generations\" is no longer the same \u2014 and that as a queer American, their own rights may not even be protected.\u00a0 \"It wasn't protecting my rights\u2026 the rights of my friends who are less privileged than I am,\" Mercer said. \"That wasn't something I wanted to serve. I didn't want to feel that shame.\" However, Mercer was optimistic that a \"new wave of voters\" is ready to bring change. \"I can speak from personal experience and from discussions with peers that we've all been very, very anxious to vote in this election, and finally have our voices heard,\" they said. Another voter, Tonya Farmer, said she was confident Trump would take 2020. \"I see more Trump signs than I do Biden signs,\" she said. As Dokoupil made his way through the battleground state of Ohio, he spoke with truckers at a truck stop along Interstate 90, America's longest interstate highway. A trucker who did not provide his name said he was \"absolutely\" excited to cast his vote, \"because of where the country's at right now.\" \"I see the country divided. I don't like that,\" he said. Biden supporter Mary Gase's vote, she said, would be cast for her daughter \u2014 a 4-year-old who fell ill when she was four. Gase is concerned about how a Trump win would affect her daughter's health care with her preexisting condition.\u00a0 \"When everything passed with Obama, we're like, awesome, great,\" Gase said. \"Just knowing that's one of the first things going before the Supreme Court is scary.\" With just over two weeks until the election, University of Dayton political science professor Nancy Martorano Miller said President Trump's failure to secure a lead at this point is \"surprising.\" She said national-scale trends in polling may be behind the tight race in Ohio, as well. \"There's an increasingly growing gap with suburban women,\" Miller said. \"And, you know, it is so much harder to run as the incumbent. It's very easy to run as, 'I am something different, I see you. I'm going to help you.'\" This time, the president's case in Ohio involves his record, in addition to his promises \u2014 which even supporters believe is mixed. Asked what grade they would give Mr. Trump's infrastructure plan, one supporter answered \"B.\" With health care, they knocked the president down to a \"C,\" having yet to replace the Affordable Care Act as he promised.\u00a0 On the economy, however, this voter awarded Mr. Trump a confident \"A plus,\" despite record unemployment linked to the coronavirus pandemic. For him to win Ohio once again, however, the president will need a boost from Democrat supporters, who turned out for him in 2016. One of these crossover voters is 94-year-old Betty Fagan. \"He's accomplished what he said he would do,\" she said. \"I didn't like Hillary and he was the best \u2014 it's awful to say \u2014 the best of two evils.\" Now, however, she has no qualms about voting Trump \u2014 when asked her opinion, she called him \"the best\u2026period.\" Tony Dokoupil's series \"At America's Crossroads\" continues on \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday at 7 a.m. and a special hour at 8 a.m.",

Senator, thank you for joining us. Before we get to business, your reflection on John Lewis. SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, John Lewis was an extraordinary hero. He was a civil rights icon. When I was newly elected to the Senate, I had the- the privilege of joining John and joining much of the Congressional Black Caucus in flying to South Africa for- for Nelson Mandela's funeral. And- and I was the only senator who attended Mandela's funeral and the entire flight there and the flight back we- we basically sat around John Lewis and listened to his stories of him as a young man, a hero, fighting for civil rights and enduring that horrific beating on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And I have to say, he was a man who believed in justice, who had incredible courage, and he is an inspiration for many generations to come. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that, Senator. I do want to ask you about the business at hand, which, as we know from the White House and from Leader McConnell's office, is this bill they plan to introduce tomorrow to provide another round of aid. You opposed it earlier this week. Are you on board now? SEN. CRUZ: I- I am not. We have right now two simultaneous national crises. We have a global pandemic. It is serious. It is taking the lives of over 600,000 people. We need to do significantly more to fight the disease. At the same time, we have an absolute economic catastrophe. We have over 44 million Americans have lost their job, and we have got to get America back to work. Unfortunately, I just listened to your interview with Speaker Pelosi, her objectives are focused on neither of those. Her objectives are shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down. And in particular, you look at the three trillion dollar bill she's trying to push. It's just shoveling money to her friends and not actually solving the problem. Our objective should be Americans want to get back to work. They want to be able to provide for their family.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SEN. CRUZ: They want to be- be- be hopeful for the future. And- and unfortunately, MARGARET, I think we're seeing Democrats. We're seeing Democratic governors. We're seeing Democratic mayors who-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But what specifically- but what specifically because in terms of the unemployment benefits, do you object to providing any kind or any amount of federal boosts to unemployment at this point? Because not everyone is choosing to be out of work.\u00a0 SEN. CRUZ: The policy that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are pushing adds an additional $600 a week of federal money to unemployment. We have the unemployment system, the system we have had-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and McConnell and wants to take it down to 70% of prior wages. SEN. CRUZ: Except, the problem is, for 68% of people receiving it right now, they are being paid more on unemployment than they made in their job. And I'll tell you, I've spoken to small business owners all over the state of Texas who are trying to reopen and they're calling their- their waiters and waitresses,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. CRUZ: --they're calling their busboys, and they won't come back. And, of course, they won't come back because the federal government is paying them, in some instances, twice as much money to stay home as-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're open to a lesser amount? SEN. CRUZ: I, look, I- what we ought to focus on, instead of just shoveling trillions out the door, we ought to be passing a recovery bill. Now, what's a recovery bill? A recovery bill would be lifting the taxes and the regulations that are hammering small businesses so that people can go back to work. A recovery bill-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 SEN. CRUZ: --would suspend the payroll tax, which would give it a- a pay raise to everyone in America who's working. That actually gets people back to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well as the treasury secretary said this morning that you could have five, six, seven other bills come in along that include things like a payroll tax but this time, unemployment in particular is something that he said needs to be extended. And- and according to our latest CBS poll, it's very popular. 74% of Republicans approve more stimulus and added benefits. 92% of Democrats. 82% of independents. So Republicans do have the burden of governing right now.\u00a0 SEN. CRUZ: Absolutely-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why aren't you onboard with this? SEN. CRUZ: I am on board with restarting the economy. What- what Democrats want to do- we're 100 days out from the presidential elec- election. The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump, and they've cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America. You know, Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she's proposing is keeping working men and women from working. And, you know, ironically, what she does have in her bill? She has a big tax cut for millionaires and billionaires in blue states.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to quickly-- SEN. CRUZ: She eliminates--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --get to you on- I'm sorry, I just want to quickly get you on China because I'm running out of time here. I know you care passionately about what happened in Houston with shuttering that consulate. What did you learn, and will more consulates be closed? SEN. CRUZ: Well, they may well be closed. That consulate was closed because it had been engaged- engaged in espionage. It had been engaged in intellectual property theft. They use it as a base for spying in Houston and throughout the Southwest. And for a long time, I- I have made the case that China poses the greatest geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century. In fact, the last time I did this show was from Hong Kong in October.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SEN. CRUZ: I traveled there. I met with the protesters. There were two million protesters in the street. And you'll recall, MARGARET, I dressed in all black in solidarity with the protesters that were standing up to Beijing and to communist China. And one of the most, in fact, the most significant foreign policy consequence of this pandemic is people are understanding the threat China poses. And in particular, this virus originated because of communist China's deliberate cover up. They arrested, they silenced the heroic Chinese whistleblowers that tried to stop this at the outset. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SEN. CRUZ: And because of that, over 600,000 people are dead, because the Chinese communist government lied. And MARGARET, you know, last year when I said that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator,-- SEN. CRUZ: --I didn't have a lot of allies in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, you didn't have the White House on board with you then. They are now. SEN. CRUZ: They- they are now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. CRUZ: People have woken up on both sides of the aisle to just how dangerous communist China is and their lies are taking away people's lives. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us. FACE THE NATION will be right back.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Representative Jerry Nadler that aired Sunday, January 19, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with House impeachment manager and Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler. He joins us from New York. Mr. Chairman, good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE JERRY NADLER: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the- the White House legal team sent their response last night to the articles of impeachment: abuse of power, obstruction of justice. They, on the first, argue that there was no violation of any law. And on the second point, they argue that the president had the right to refuse to produce documents and witnesses due to executive privilege. How are you going to prosecute this case? REP. NADLER: Well, both of those statements are arrant nonsense. There is ample evidence, overwhelming evidence. Any jury would convict in three minutes flat that the president betrayed his country by breaking the law. The GAO, the General Accountability Office, just came out this week and pointed out that withholding money from Uk- from Ukraine that Congress had appropriated is against the law. But we didn't need them to tell us that. And the reason he did that was in order to extort a foreign government to- to smear his political opponents for his personal benefits and to help try to rig the 2020 election as he worked with the Russians to try to rig the 2016 election. The same pattern. So, there is no question that working with a foreign- working with a foreign power, trying to extort a foreign power to interfere in our election is about as bad as you can imagine. The main fear the framers of the Constitution had, why they put the impeachment clause in the Constitution, was they were afraid of foreign interference in- in our domestic affairs. The second thing they say that he broke no law is absurd. Abuse of power is the central reason for the impeachment clause in the Constitution. It's all over the Federalist Papers. It's all over the debates in the constitutional convention. There is no question about it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- REP. NADLER: And the evidence is overwhelming.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I- I- I want to ask-- REP. NADLER: And the last thing they said is- is--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0 REP. NADLER: --is that- is that the president is entitled to withhold documents. No, he's not. The House of Representatives has the impeachment power under the Constitution. And that includes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REP. NADLER: --and the Supreme Court ruled that in the Nixon case that he has every right- that we must demand documents. He- he can't withhold all the evidence and by the way- and then say there's not enough evidence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, on the question of witnesses, from what we are hearing from Senate Republicans, there will eventually be a vote on whether or not to hear from witnesses. Not a commitment upfront, but an agreement to talk about it and vote on it later. Is there any circumstance in which Democrats would consider, for reciprocity, having Hunter Biden come and testify? REP. NADLER: You know, the question of witnesses in any trial, in any trial, all relevant witnesses must be heard. Whether if- if you're accused of robbing a bank, testi- testimony that I saw him rob the bank or he was somewhere else, he couldn't have robbed the bank, is admissible. It's not negotiable whether you have witnesses. And this whole controversy about whether there should be witnesses is just- is really a question of does the Senate want to have a fair trial or do they- or are they part of the cover up of the president? Any Republican senator who says there should be no witnesses or even that witnesses should be negotiated is part of the cover up. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying no way would Hunter Biden ever be called to testify? REP. NADLER: Well, I'm saying that Hunter Biden has no knowledge of the accusations against the president. Did the president, as we said- as the evidence shows that he did, betray his country by conspiring with a foreign country to- to try to rig the election? Hunter Biden has nothing to say about that. They're- they're asking for Hunter Biden is just more of a smear of Hunter Biden that the president's trying to get the Ukraine to do. But the fact of the matter is, let the chief justice rule on- on-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- REP. NADLER: --the chief justice in the first instance rules on evidence. The Senate can overrule him.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 REP. NADLER: But no chief justice would- would- would think of- of admitting evidence that- that is not relevant-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- REP. NADLER: No trial judge would in any trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about evidence, because Lev Parnas, the business associate of Rudy Giuliani- some of the documents that he turned over were included in the briefs submitted by Democrats just last night. Are- many Republicans say, it shouldn't be admissible at all. Do Democrats want to hear him testify? And given his legal troubles, given his ties to Russian oligarchs, why do you think he is credible? REP. NADLER:\u00a0 Well, he seems to be credible because everything he says corroborates things we knew. New documents that- that he has brought out corrob- from the time, corroborate what he was saying. But the- the main credit, the main thing is all relevant evidence should be admitted. And the president has engaged in a- in a concerted attempt to deny all evidence. Everyone who testified defied the president testifying. I mean, Mike Pompeo ought to testify. John Bolton ought to testify. What is the president hiding? The president says don't let these people testify. If they were- if they had exculpatory evidence, he'd be saying let them testify. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, the White House argues that it sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents. But I want to ask you about-- REP. NADLER: There is no precedent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to ask you about-- REP. NADLER: That is- that is- that is nonsense. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the president's legal team or at least some lawyers who are going to be speaking on behalf of the president, Alan Dershowitz among them, Ken Starr also added as someone who is going to be speaking before the Senate. What do you think of their additions to the team? What does that suggest to you as someone who will be prosecuting? REP. NADLER: I'm not going to comment on their witnesses, except that Ken Starr thinks that,\u00a0 apparently thinks that, asking a foreign government to involve itself in our elections is okay. But the president 20 years ago talking about a private sexual affair, now that's impeachable. I mean, he's- he's- it's ridiculous. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Alan Dershowitz says it's not a constitutional criteria for impeachment, abuse of power. It doesn't meet that standard. REP. NADLER:\u00a0 Well, I was surprised to see Alan Dershowitz say that. That's simply ignorance. If you read all the history of impeachments in the country, if you read the Federalist Papers, if you read the Consti- the- the Constitutional Convention debates from the 1780s, if you read the majority staff report of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974, there's no question about that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. OK.\u00a0 REP. NADLER: It's ridiculous. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Chairman, we'll be watching. Thank you very much for your time this morning.",

            "article_content": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg's career was devoted to empowering and fighting for women. Both in and outside of the Supreme Court, the late justice known as the Notorious RBG fought against sex discrimination and for the right for all to celebrate their love in marriage.\u00a0 Upon news of her death on Friday, millions of women took to social media to express fear that Ginsburg's legacy will be threatened \u2014 and harnessed that fear into creating rallying cry for people to unite, fight and vote.\u00a0 Today is a sad day for women, a sad day for lawyers, and a sad day for justice. She fought tirelessly until the end for justice and the rule of law; and frankly, gave this country more of her than it deserved. Rest well. #RBG I am so sad. We love you Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. You were an incredible leader, attorney, judge, advocate, fighter, mom, grandma. Our country and its women will never be the same.#RBG Imara Jones, creator and producer of TransLash Media, told CBS News she is feeling \"dread\" following Ginsburg's death, which she said comes at a time where there is \"so much division and pettiness.\"\u00a0 \"A dread for the common fight, a dread for the loss of a strong voice in women's rights. I mean, to say that she was a strong voice in women's rights understates her impact,\" she said. \"A large reason why women have achieved the rights we have is literally because of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\"\u00a0 Jones said one of the most notable aspects of Ginsburg's career was her understanding that all women, not just cisgender white women, deserve equality.\u00a0 \"She fully understands this link between the rights of cis women and trans women,\" Jones said. \"The way that gender is coded in the law and that if we begin to separate the rights of any woman, we actually undermine the rights of all women.\"\u00a0 During a year of tremendous loss this one cuts deep. Not only was Justice Ginsburg a champion of the rights of all women... \"She was civil but at the same time she was a warrior,\" Jones continued \"... And because she was able to hold those two things at the same time, she managed to revolutionize law in the United States and to expand equal protections to women in a way that was unprecedented before her life.\"\u00a0 This, Jones said, is largely why Ginsburg's death has turned into a rallying cry for people to vote. Many of the women CBS News spoke with expressed fear that the Supreme Court's conservative majority will roll back equality protections. \"The danger here is that we end up having a very dark moment for women,\" Jones said. Via Garcia, who identifies as a lesbian woman of color, told CBS News she was \"shocked\" when she found out about Ginsburg's death on TikTok \u2014 and \"then the panic and fear set in.\" \"RBG helped so much, she helped continue to uphold Roe v. Wade, helped with getting marriage equality in the U.S. and has been such an icon during these scary times,\" Garcia said. \"I'm hoping it all stays the same and that they don't get overturned. It's the Supreme Court. Everyone assumes the laws passed will never be overturned, so for everyone's sake, let's hope that is true.\" \u00a0 Despite the fear she is feeling, Garcia told CBS News that it's up to the masses to continue fighting for the issues that Ginsburg spent decades addressing.\u00a0 \"It is our time to fight, this is our future and the future of the next generation,\" she said. \"If we don't fight to keep things the way they are going, it'll be a huge back-tracking of rights.\" Ginsburg, who died at 87 due to complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer,\u00a0fought for women\u00a0long before she joined the Supreme Court in 1993. In the 1970s, she worked with the American Civil Liberties Union to litigate sex discrimination cases, helped launch the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, and advocated for the Equal Rights Amendment.\u00a0 When she joined the Supreme Court \u2014 becoming only the second woman in U.S. history to do so \u2014 she regularly ruled in favor of progressive issues, including for abortion access and LGBTQ rights and against the disenfranchisement of people of color.\u00a0 As an ACLU lawyer, Justice Ginsburg argued her first Supreme Court case against sex discrimination in 1973, in front of exclusively male justices.She succeeded, winning that case and four others she argued before SCOTUS. Part of Ginsburg's fame stems from her iconic quotes\u00a0on these issues. In the documentary \"RBG,\" Ginsburg sad, \"I ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.\" \u00a0 Bailee Earl told CBS News that, despite Ginsburg's death feeling \"like the final nail in the coffin,\" people owe it to her and each other to protect her legacy and \"maintain that momentum.\"\u00a0 \"Our political system is broken, and has been for a long time, but everything has been coming to a head over the past few years,\" she said. \"RBG felt like the last line of defense against an increasingly hostile sect of Republicans who are intent on undoing pretty much anything with Barack Obama's name on it.\"\u00a0 \"We have a level of privilege as U.S. citizens that can't be ignored,\" Earl said. \"There are women all over the world in more dire situations, but admitting that does not mean that we need to sit down, shut up, and say 'thank you' to those in power for rights that so many fought tooth and nail to secure.\" \"We can't all be on the Supreme Court, but we can all refuse to back down in the face of inequity,\" Earl added. Vigils popped up throughout the U.S. on Friday night and Saturday, with people turning out to pay their respects to the late justice. Near a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. in Denver on Friday night, Colorado State Representative Leslie Herod told CBS Denver that \"Justice Ginsburg spoke to generations of women, generations of activists, generations of people who care for this country and want to fight to make it better.\" Herod and many others at the vigil expressed to CBS Denver that they feel it's now the people's turn to fight.\u00a0 \"Fight. Fight like hell for this country,\" Herod said. \"Fight for what she stood for, and never go back.\" Celebrities, including actress Kerry Washington, tweeted out sentiments that people should use Ginsburg's death as motivation to vote in the upcoming election.\u00a0 \"Her rest is earned,\" Washington tweeted. \"It is our turn to fight.\"\u00a0 She encouraged her followers to \"fight for her like she fought for us,\" as they prepare to cast their ballots in November. Her rest is earned. It is our turn to fight. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the country \"lost a giant,\" but that \"we can, and must, fight.\" \"Now is not the time for cynicism or hopelessness. There is and continues to be political possibility to preserve our democracy & move forward.  It will require each & every one of us, from the streets to the Senate, to grow in courage, strength, and strategy. But it is possible,\" she tweeted. \"You do not need to, nor should you, ignore your fears \u2014   there is plenty to be afraid of \u2014   but we have possibilities before us...We must get to work. Everyone matters. Everyone has something to give.\" Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Attorneys representing President Trump asked the Supreme Court to shield his tax and business records from investigators on Tuesday, arguing in a pair of high-profile cases that subpoenas from Congress and state authorities should be quashed given his responsibilities as head of the executive branch. The court heard oral arguments in the cases over teleconference as justices continue to work remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. The disputes focus on requests for documents from Mr. Trump's accounting firm and several financial institutions as part of investigations by three Houses committees and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance into the president's business dealings. During the first round of questioning on Tuesday, the president's personal attorney and a lawyer for the Justice Department, which is backing the president, asserted that the congressional subpoenas served no legislative purpose and were therefore invalid. They warned that upholding the subpoenas from the House committees would effectively give Congress the green light to investigate the private lives of their political opponents. \"I think it is very hard to imagine that that House is ever going to have the power ... to subpoena the records of the president,\" Patrick Strawbridge, appearing on behalf of the president, said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts. \"The House has limited powers to regulate the presidency itself,\" he added. Strawbridge asserted in questioning from Justice Brett Kavanaugh that the Congressional subpoenas were meant not to aid in lawmaking, but serve as a \"dragnet\" to uncover alleged wrongdoing of the president. Jeffrey Wall, principal deputy solicitor general, agreed, saying the subpoenas \"don't match up with what the committees say they're doing.\" The four liberal justices were deeply skeptical of the argument put forth by the president's attorneys. Justice Elena Kagan noted that previous disputes between the legislative and executive branches are typically resolved by both sides making accommodations, and questioned why the court should rule that the president's personal records can be shielded from a congressional subpoena. \"What it seems to me you're asking us to do is to put a kind of 10-ton weight on the scales between the president and Congress,\" Kagan said. But Wall argued the danger came not from the court intervening, but rather from overly broad congressional subpoenas that \"will harm and undermine the presidency of the United States.\" \"Not just this president. The institution of the presidency going forward,\" Wall said. Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, pushed back on the claim that the subpoenas were targeting the president to damage him politically. He argued there is nothing novel about the subpoenas seeking Mr. Trump's records and said Congress is conducting its oversight responsibilities to determine whether new legislation concerning financial disclosures and government ethics is needed. \"There is no responsible claim here that all that's going on is harassment,\" Letter told the justices, saying the House committees were seeking the records to inform their legislative duties. The conservative justices peppered Letter with questions about what, if any, limits there are on congressional subpoenas, and Letter struggled to address several hypothetical scenarios. Justice Samuel Alito said he was \"baffled\" by some of Letter's responses, adding that he \"can't think of a single example of a subpoena that wouldn't meet\" the requirements the House had set for itself. Letter attempted to allay the concerns of another of the court's conservatives, Justice Clarence Thomas, who worried that Congress' subpoena power may go unchecked. \"Not a single thing is required of the president or the White House,\" Letter said, to which Thomas uncharacteristically replied, \"I think we all know it's about the president.\" A ruling from the Supreme Court is expected by late June, in the heart of the presidential campaign, and will have implications for the separation of powers. Mr. Trump has fought vehemently to protect his tax returns despite promising to make them public during the 2016 presidential campaign. A loss at the Supreme Court could bring an end to those efforts. The justices first heard arguments in a case that consolidated suits over congressional subpoenas issued to Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, and two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One. The Democrat-led House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to Mazars in April 2019 requesting eight years of financial records related to Mr. Trump and his business entities as part of an investigation into whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his presidency, as well as whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest and is complying with the Constitution's Emoluments Clauses. But Mr. Trump sought to block Mazars from complying with the subpoena and sued his longtime accounting firm in federal district court in Washington. The district court, however, sided with congressional investigators. A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the subpoena as constitutional, ruling it had a \"legitimate legislative purpose.\" The second, similar dispute involves three subpoenas issued by the Democrat-led House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees to Deutsche Bank and Capital One.\u00a0 The Financial Services Committee subpoenaed Capital One for account records for Mr. Trump's business entities as part of an investigation into money laundering and foreign influence. The same panel and the Intelligence Committee also issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank for financial records for Mr. Trump's business entities, as well as for the president and his three children, dating back to January 2010. The president and his family sued the banks in April 2019 to challenge enforcement of the subpoenas, claiming they exceeded Congress's constitutional and statutory authority. The federal district court in New York, however, denied the request to block compliance. In December, a divided panel of judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the banks can turn over Mr. Trump's financial information and found the committees had legitimate legislative purposes for issuing the subpoenas. The third case involves a grand-jury subpoena issued by Vance, the Manhattan DA, to Mazars as part of a criminal investigation into Mr. Trump's business dealings and hush-money payments made to two women who allegedly had affairs with the president years before the 2016 election. Vance is seeking business records and tax returns dating back to 2011. Mr. Trump sued in federal court in September, arguing he is immune to criminal proceedings while in office, but the district court ruled against him. The 2nd Circuit ruled the president's claims of immunity \"do not bar the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non-privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the president.\" The Justice Department is backing Mr. Trump in the trio of cases. During Tuesday's arguments, Mr. Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said the Constitution grants the president immunity from demands for records and testimony by local authorities. \"Temporary presidential immunity is constitutionally required,\" Sekulow said, arguing that validating Vance's subpoena would \"weaponize 2,300 local DAs\" and allow them to \"harass, distract and interfere with a sitting president.\" In their brief for the court, the president's legal team wrote that \"politically motivated subpoenas like this one are a perfect illustration of why a sitting president should be categorically immune from state criminal process.\" Conservative and liberal justices questioned the president's claim of \"absolute immunity\" from state investigations, seemingly skeptical of a blanket ruling shielding the president in non-federal cases. \"You're asking for broader immunity than anyone else gets,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\u00a0 Carey Dunne, general counsel for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, proposed that the president's claim of immunity poses great danger to the power and processes of state grand juries, telling Justice Clarence Thomas that such an interpretation \"completely upends the way a grand jury process is supposed to work.\" Justice Samuel Alito, who seemed most amenable to the president's arguments, asked whether the release of the president's records could threaten his privacy. \"There are prosecutors who leak all sorts of information,\" Alito added. Dunne explained that secrecy rules prevent disclosure of confidential information, and said he is \"not aware of any real kind of pattern\" of leaking. The disputes are a test of the Supreme Court's new conservative majority for critics who scrutinize its independence. Mr. Trump has named two justices to the high court, Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, whose confirmation in October 2018 shifted the court rightward. Somewhat surprisingly, both justices expressed varying levels of skepticism of the president's arguments in their questioning on Tuesday. Late last month, the court asked lawyers for both sides to submit additional legal briefs addressing whether the cases raise a political question that should not be adjudicated by the courts.",

            "article_content": "Davos, Switzerland \u2013 Nearly 50 years after abortion was legalized in the United States, a wave of restrictions, bans and court cases have made the future of abortion access less certain than ever. Wednesday marks the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. While attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Planned Parenthood acting president Alexis McGill Johnson spoke with CBS News in an exclusive interview about the state of abortion access in the United States. \"Here we are talking about the fourth industrial revolution and yet we are still talking about the impact of all of these onerous restrictions and bans on access to safe and legal abortion in the States,\" Johnson said on Wednesday morning. \"I think there's a perfect illustration of this, is the idea that there's actually a tale of two cities right now, the idea that \u2026 in one state there's a girl who's literally opening up her imagination, her ability to think about her future in a totally different way, and in another state and city she's actually fighting just to get access to basic, basic health care.\" This year could prove to be a landmark year for abortion access. In March, the Supreme Court will hear arguments for June Medical Services v. Gee\u00a0\u2014 the first time it will hear a case on abortion practices since the addition of the high court's two new conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0 \"We're already living in a world where there are abortion deserts, where it's difficult to access. When you layer on this case, which, if it doesn't overturn Roe will have the impact of ... effectively gutting Roe, the work that we have to do is really push back,\" Johnson said.\" At the center of June Medical Services v. Gee is Act 620, Louisiana's \"Unsafe Abortion Protection Act,\" a 2014 state law not currently in effect. Similar to a Texas law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016, Louisiana's law requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles away. If the law is allowed to be implemented, all of Louisiana's abortion clinics would close, as first reported by CBS News. Last year, state legislatures introduced an unprecedented number of abortion restrictions and bans. State lawmakers introduced over 300 anti-abortion measures in 2019, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization. Twelve states passed bans on the procedure, including a near-total ban on the procedure in Alabama. Though all have been blocked by federal judges, many other restrictions have gone into effect, including mandatory waiting periods and other measures designed to dissuade women from choosing an abortion.\u00a0 In 2020, Johnson said to expect \"more of the same.\" \"We expect to see more of the targeted restrictions against abortion providers, limiting their ability to provide access to services or we will see more intense scrutiny and burdens put, placed \u2026 on the person seeking the abortion,\" Johnson said.\u00a0 This legislative session, lawmakers in South Carolina will look at a six-week ban on the procedure while politicians in Tennessee and Ohio are set to consider near-total bans on the procedure. While at Davos, Johnson said she is discussing how these restrictions impact the workforce. \"We know that if we want women to succeed in business, if we want to increase the level of participation of women at the CEO level or the C-suite level, it's incredibly important for women to be able to control their reproductive health because we know that access to controlling and planning when \u2026\u00a0 you will be pregnant, also impacts your ability to engage in the economy,\" Johnson said. The following is the extended interview with Planned Parenthood acting president Alexis McGill Johnson and CBS News reporter Kate Smith. It has been lightly edited for clarity: Kate Smith: What are you hoping to bring back from what you're learning here for Planned Parenthood? Alexis McGill Johnson: Well you know it's so interesting. There are a number of tracks on healthcare systems and innovation within healthcare systems and I feel like that to me is this special unique place for Planned Parenthood.\u00a0 The opportunity to both kind of think how we're going to engage in healthcare delivery for our health centers and our patients. And then also, make sure that we are engaging with our business community as well to talk to them about the impact of all of these restrictions on the workforce of the future. So what do you want to bring back? Anything you've heard that's particularly interesting? There have been a number of sessions on data, and ensuring that we are using the access to data in a way that's really helping us think about how we're solving for impact, how we are engaging across a number of platforms. The theme of the conference is the fourth industrial revolution and so all the ways in which technology is going to disrupt and engage and how we get in front of that disruption has been really exciting. Today is the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in United States. What is the status of abortion and reproductive health in the United States today? Well, here's the irony, right? I'm actually 47 years old, so I'm as old as Roe. And here we are talking about the fourth industrial revolution and yet we are still talking about the impact of all of these onerous restrictions and bans on access to safe and legal abortion in the States. I often talk about it in terms of healthcare shouldn't be dictated by our zip code, and I think there's a perfect illustration of that.\u00a0 There's actually a tale of two cities right now in the United States. Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles has actually just opened five health centers \u2013 five wellbeing centers inside of high schools where young girls are walking in and getting access to amazing information about their reproductive health, as well as access to contraception. They don't need parental consent and it's actually free because of MediCal.\u00a0 In the state of Missouri, a young woman might be driving 200 miles to St. Louis to get access to abortion service and she might have to listen to a state-mandated script, and then come back to actually have the procedure and all the while there may be some person in the state health department who's actually tracking her menstrual cycle in an Excel file.\u00a0 So the idea that in one state, there is a girl who's literally opening up her imagination, her ability to think about her future in a totally different way, and in another state and city she's actually fighting just to get access to basic, basic health care and I think that's the state of reproductive rights right now. As an organization, how do you combat the idea that there's completely fragmented access to reproductive healthcare in the United States? There is fragmented access in the sense that, again, state by state, people have different experiences accessing healthcare. We've had 300 [restrictions] just last year. We've had 180 judges who've been confirmed over the last few years.\u00a0 So we are engaged in that fragmented access, but I do feel like we are more aligned in terms of our kind of relationship with our partners on the ground. We are really building out relationships in a very deliberate way with independent providers, with our reproductive justice communities and engaging in figuring out how our advocacy can be strengthened as a movement when we move forward together. There's new data today from Kaiser that says that 49% of people support so-called \"fetal heartbeat\" bans, bans on abortion after six weeks, and 50% oppose them. It's about half and half. What do you make of that? We also know that almost eight out of 10 Americans support Roe as the law of the land and there's no state in the United States where people feel as though it should be overturned.\u00a0 I think that what's happened is that people, largely the conservative and the anti-abortion community, have been effective in trying to take this away from the choice that the woman should be making in concert with her partner, with her doctor, with her pastor, with her religious provider, whomever, and put it in the hands of the state legislator.\u00a0 When you drill down deeply into that, when you talk about the stories that people are actually going through when they're making these decisions, you see people retrench back from that. Even though Americans do support Roe v. Wade, many of them support many of the restrictions that could make Roe v. Wade effectively useless. I mean how do you combat that? How do you look at that? We're already living in a world where there are abortion deserts, where it is difficult to access. When you layer on this case, which, if it doesn't overturn Roe, it will have the impact of effectively gutting Roe, the work that we have to do is to really push back to our states.\u00a0 If Roe's overturned, that means it goes back to the states, and we need to make sure that state by state we are fighting for access in every state legislature. I think that's the long game. 2020, in November, whether or not we, get a pro-choice White House and a pro-choice Senate and hold our amazing pro-choice House, that will all be wonderful if that happens, that that trifecta happens.\u00a0 If it doesn't, we will still continue to have to fight with all of these and contend with all these Supreme Court cases that are winding their way up that will have the impact of effectively limiting access. For the Supreme Court case in March, are you worried? Yes, absolutely, because the only reason they would take a case that was identical to Whole Women's Health is because the court makeup has changed. If you know we have Justice Kavanaugh on the bench \u2013 and we're very clear on where he is on this issue \u2013 that will really be concerning for us.\u00a0 Our plan, Planned Parenthood, we're at our best when we were both kind of looking forward and pushing back at the same time. That's a kind of unique strength that we have. While we are here engaged at Davos, learning all we can about how to provide health care delivery to those who are in the most marginalized communities, we are also thinking about how we are going to transfer those skills in the U.S. and ensure that we are mapping out strategies that every person who desires access to abortion will be able to get one. If the Supreme Court were to uphold the law at the center of the Louisiana case that we're going to see in March, what would be the impact? I think what it will do is actually embolden state legislatures across the country to enact these similar bans and TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws around abortion providers that will then eventually impact our ability as abortion providers to provide access to abortion. If Roe is gutted or overturned to the point where access is banned in those states, we're talking about 25 million women of reproductive age who will be limited with their access. Do these kinds of restrictions and regulations make Roe effectively useless? Yes. I think it's very similar to what we saw with the Voting Rights Act. You have a federal enforcement of the federal protection of voting and yet, all of these limitations that are being put in, these voter ID laws, these limitations to actually accessing or exercising your right to vote, it's a very similar model and in fact it's one of the reasons why I've been so heartened to hear a few candidates really adopt strategies that look at things like pre-clearance, things that actually may make a difference on the federal level while we wait to see what the courts bring back to us. What can people expect to see from Planned Parenthood moving into the 2020 election? We've just announced a $45 million spend, which is unprecedented and historic for us to engage over five million voters, undecided voters. We will be out state by state engaging, turning out, educating and ensuring that they understand what's at stake in this election. Planned Parenthood has received criticism for spending so much money in elections, especially when they receive taxpayer dollars for non-abortion services. How do you justify spending so much money on an election? We are a healthcare provider, but we also have to defend access to the health care that we provide. The monies that we are raising are going into federal PAC dollars. These are not resources that would be going into any entity that would be engaged in providing health care. Moving into 2020, what can we expect to see from a regulatory standpoint for state-level abortion restrictions. I think we expect to see more of the same, we expect to see more of the targeted restrictions against abortion providers, limiting their ability to provide access to service or we will see more intense scrutiny and burdens placed on the person seeking the abortion. Last year we saw an unprecedented number of abortion bans and restrictions. This year, you say we're going to see more of the same. Does it ever feel like Planned Parenthood is losing this battle? This isn't about Planned Parenthood. This is about the millions of people that we serve and when you actually look at the the state of support for Roe, the 77% of Americans who actually believe that Roe should be the law of the land, you have to wonder why it's not translating.\u00a0 To me, the case is that there's a vocal minority who control the levers of power and our work is to really shift those levers of power in 2020 to ensure that the will of the people actually remains the law of land. One of the biggest themes of Davos is always corporate consciousness. How can companies tap into their stakeholders, not just their shareholders, and align their values better with the people that surround them. So, how can Planned Parenthood tap into that? There's always been a conversation around gender equity. We know that if we want women to succeed in business, if we want to increase the level of participation of women at the CEO level or the C suite level, it's incredibly important for them to be able to control their reproductive health.\u00a0 We know that access to controlling and planning when and where you will be pregnant also impacts your ability to to engage in the economy. We also know that the impact on the workforce, that the workforce of the future as women continue to gain ground in a number of these fields including technology, will be incredibly important for these conversations.\u00a0 So the CEOs are not unaware of it. In fact, 180 of them signed a letter in July of last year, advocating for greater access to contraception, so I think they are aligned. It really is important for them to not just talk the talk but ensure that they are also walking the walk and continue to advocate for these policies to increase access across the board.\u00a0 Is that something that we can expect more of as more of these bans and restrictions roll through? I think, you know, the conversation here is around public-private partnership and it's also about engaging in relationships with with our various governments and states. I really do hope that CEOs will look at opportunities to engage more directly in these conversations and to be more vocal because their workforce is demanding that of them as well.",

            "article_content": "The lead defense attorney for Michael Flynn said Tuesday that she has asked President Trump not to pardon her client. \u00a0 Though she was reticent about discussing her communications with the White House during a federal court hearing, Sydney Powell admitted that she had spoken with President Trump and his legal adviser recently about the status of the former national security adviser's legal troubles. Tuesday's hearing comes after a summer of appeals court battles which determined that the presiding lower court judge, Emmet Sullivan, does not have to immediately approve Attorney General Bill Barr's request to dismiss the charges against Flynn. Instead, Sullivan may proceed with his own review of the matter, the appeals court decided. While a presidential pardon would end Flynn's years-long legal saga, it would come months after the government had already moved to dismiss the criminal charges.\u00a0 However, before that decision by the Justice Department, the president had said in March that he was \"strongly considering\" a full pardon for Flynn. When Powell was first asked by Sullivan whether or not she had spoken with Mr. Trump about the case, she replied, \"I have not your honor, while the case is pending pre-motion to dismiss or otherwise \u2014 other than an update as to what happened in it.\"\u00a0 Confused by her answer, Sullivan repeated his question. This time, Powell declined to answer.\u00a0 \"I would think that any conversations that I had with the president would be protected by executive privilege,\" she said. \"But you don't work for the government,\" Sullivan pointed out.\u00a0 Powell maintained that she did not view executive privilege as limited only to those who work for the government. Under further questioning, she acknowledged that she had spoken in person with Mr. Trump and his legal counsel, Jenna Ellis, in the past couple of weeks to update them on Flynn's case, and to ask that \"he not issue a pardon.\"\u00a0 She couldn't recall the number of times she has spoken with the president, noting that the New York Times has reported she has spoken with him on five occasions. But she made clear that she had only spoken with Mr. Trump about the pending litigation in Flynn's case on one occasion. \u00a0 When asked whether or not she had asked the president to instruct Barr to replace the prosecutors on the case, she replied, \"Oh heavens, no.\" \"I never discussed this case with the president until recently, when I asked him not to issue a pardon and gave him a general update on the status of the litigation,\" Powell maintained.\u00a0 During the nearly six-hour hearing, she railed against the proceedings that have continued against Flynn, calling them \"a hideous abuse of power that continues to this very minute.\" Former Judge John Gleeson, appointed by Sullivan to argue in opposition to the government's move to dismiss the charges against Flynn, said the government of twisting itself\u00a0 into \"contortions\" to appease Flynn's friends in high places in the government, including the President. He reiterated his position that Sullivan, as the presiding judge, has a duty to review the matter before him in full, and not simply \"rubber stamp\" the government's request. \"Once a prosecution has commenced, once the government brings a criminal charge by indictment or information into your courtroom, the power to dismiss it is qualified. You are not only entitled but you are obligated to demand the reasons and to evaluate the reasons,\" Gleeson said. \"You are not required to act like you were born yesterday.\" While Gleeson repeated his argument that the government actions were rooted in political bias and pressure from the White House, prosecutor Kenneth Kohl, from the District of Columbia U.S. attorney's office, rejected that claim. \"I have been around the courthouse for three decades. I am the senior ranking career person right now, and I wanted to appear today because the allegations against our office that we would somehow operate or act with a corrupt political motive just are not true,\" Kohl said. \"I have never seen it in my entire career in our office and it didn't happen here. I am here to say that the U.S. attorney's office decision to dismiss this case was the right call, for the right reasons.\" Flynn originally pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, shortly after the 2016 presidential election. The case against Flynn stemmed from the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election, but was later prosecuted by special counsel Robert Mueller's office.\u00a0 With a new legal team in place, Flynn moved to withdraw his guilty plea in January, after accusing the government of acting in \"bad faith,\" and for withholding exculpatory evidence pertinent to his case. Less than six months later Barr announced that the department would dismiss new charges, after determining that the FBI's interview of Flynn was not conducted for any \"legitimate investigative basis.\" Under his original plea agreement, Flynn cooperated with federal investigators, which led to a delay in his original sentencing date in December 2018 before Judge Sullivan.\u00a0 Sullivan made no rulings after the hearing, and has taken the matter under advisement, but has promised to make his decision with \"dispatch.\"",

            "article_content": "More than two years after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee brought the panel's investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference to a\u00a0close, the committee has released\u00a0transcripts of 57 closed-door interviews with witnesses in the saga that captivated \u2014 and divided \u2014 Washington for months. The transcripts span more than 6,000 pages and include interviews with some of the key figures in the committee's Russia probe, including Donald Trump, Jr., Hope Hicks, Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. They offer the most granular look to date at some of the central characters and controversies surrounding President Trump, his 2016 presidential campaign and the government officials who investigated both. Their release comes several days after Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell wrote a letter to Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, the committee's chairman, saying the transcripts had been reviewed for classified material and were ready to be made public. Schiff blamed the White House for the delay in releasing the transcripts publicly. \"These transcripts should have been released long before now, but the White House held up their release to the public by refusing to allow the Intelligence Community to make redactions on the basis of classified information, rather than White House political interests,\" Schiff said in a statement Thursday. \"Only now, and during a deadly pandemic, has the President released his hold on this damning information and evidence.\" In the early months of the Trump administration in 2017, journalists, camera crews and photographers packed the basement of the Capitol, where a daily battle was waged outside the committee's secure spaces over incremental leaks about which witnesses were due to appear and what those who already testified had said. Democrats would express public concern about what had been uncovered, occasionally accusing witnesses of being uncooperative and Republicans of being uninterested in the truth. Republicans lambasted Democrats for weaponizing leaks and distorting burgeoning findings with innuendo. Partisanship on the historically bipartisan committee\u00a0skyrocketed, and\u00a0turned toxic. In April of 2018, the committee\u00a0released\u00a0a redacted report drafted by Republicans summarizing the committee's findings from its year-long investigation. The report was accompanied by the Democrats' dissenting minority views, detailed in a 98-page document. Republicans said they had found \"no evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians,\" and declared the case closed, even as parallel investigations by special counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller\u00a0and the\u00a0Senate Intelligence Committee\u00a0continued. (Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia but described a pattern of interactions between the two; the Senate committee is expected to issue its\u00a0final volume\u00a0of findings on the matter later this year.) Five months later, in September of 2018, both Republicans and Democrats on the committee voted to publicly release the witness transcripts, with a small handful of exceptions and pending a classification review by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Months later, the review process appeared to be stalled as the committee, by then led by the Democrats,\u00a0objected\u00a0to ODNI sharing a subset of those transcripts with the White House. Schiff said the transcripts were the property of the committee and that the White House should not be given the opportunity to claim \"overly expansive\" privilege to \"claw back\" information that had been provided to Congress. The impasse persisted as\u00a0impeachment hearings\u00a0into Mr. Trump began and leadership at ODNI was shuffled. It appeared to lift on May 4, when Grenell informed Schiff that the review process had been completed and the transcripts were ready for release. \"Pursuant to your guidance,\" Grenell wrote, the contested transcripts \"have not been shared with the White House.\"",

            "article_content": "House Democrats can sue in order to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a congressional subpoena, according to a ruling by a federal appeals court Friday. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in a 7-2 decision, ruled the House reserves the right to force White House officials to testify. The court rejected the Justice Department's separation of powers argument that the executive branch must be protected from the power of the congressional branch. It determined that the committee has the standing \"to seek enforcement in federal court of its duly issued subpoena in the performance of constitutional responsibilities.\"\u00a0 \"Preserving the power of a House of Congress to ensure compliance with its subpoena ... enables it to carry out its constitutional responsibilities, which include serving as an essential check on the president and executive branch,\" the majority opinion by Judge Judith Rogers stated. The court left open the possibility that McGahn could assert executive privilege in responding to some of Congress' questions. The full en banc court's ruling was a partial one, and it remanded McGahn's other claims to the three-judge panel for consideration. Democrats initially subpoenaed McGahn in light of his role in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which examined whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice by attempting to halt the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0 Friday's ruling is the latest development in the ongoing battle between House Democrats and the White House for information and testimony related to the president's conduct in office. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler welcomed the decision. \"The court rejected President Trump's sweeping claim that committees of the House have no standing before the courts to seek redress of the institutional injury caused when lawfully issued subpoenas are ignored,\" House Judiciary Chairman Nadler said in a statement. \"Today's decision confirms the Judiciary's ability to resolve these disputes. \"We look forward to the favorable resolution of the remaining issues before the DC Circuit in short order,\" Nadler continued, adding, \"[T]oday's decision strikes a blow against the wall of impunity that President Trump has tried to build for himself. And it reaffirms the core principle behind the Supreme Court's rulings last month:\u00a0 No one\u2014not even the president\u2014is above the law.\" Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement that the department \"strongly\" disagrees with the partial ruling, but noted that the parts of the case remained to be argued before the appeals panel, saying, \"we intend to vigorously press those arguments.\" McGahn left the White House in December 2018 and was replaced by current White House counsel Pat Cipollone.\u00a0 Clare Hymes contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 In a legal brief ahead of his Senate trial, President Trump's legal team argues that the articles of impeachment passed by the House are \"an affront to the Constitution\" and should be rejected by the Senate. The\u00a0110-page brief\u00a0was written by Mr. Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who are leading his impeachment defense. The White House filed it with the Senate ahead of a noon deadline.\u00a0 The document lays out many of the same assertions that appeared a six-page brief the president's team filed over the weekend, largely that the \"flimsy\" impeachment articles \"allege no crime or violation of law whatsoever\" and don't warrant his removal from office. \"The diluted standard asserted here would permanently weaken the presidency and forever alter the balance among the branches of government in a manner that offends the constitutional design established by the founders,\" the brief reads.\u00a0 The 13-page executive summary argues Democrats have no evidence to support their claims and have \"perverted\" the impeachment process for political purposes. \"The Senate should speedily reject these deficient articles of impeachment and acquit the president,\" the executive summary reads. \"The only threat to the Constitution that House Democrats have brought to light is their own degradation of the impeachment process and trampling of the separation of powers. Their fixation on damaging the president has trivialized the momentous act of impeachment, debased the standards of impeachable conduct, and perverted the power of impeachment by turning it into a partisan, election-year political tool.\"\u00a0 The lawyers argued the Democrats' \"novel theory of 'abuse of power' does not state an impeachable offense\" under the Constitution, referring to the first impeachment article passed by the House in December. The article charges the president with using the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations targeting his political opponents. \"House Democrats' novel conception of 'abuse of power' as a supposedly impeachable offense is constitutionally defective,\" the brief reads. \"It supplants the framers' standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'\"\u00a0 The White House also argued that the second article of impeachment \u2014 obstruction of Congress \u2014 fails to rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Democrats charged the president for blocking witnesses from testifying and withholding evidence in defiance of subpoenas issued during the House impeachment inquiry. \"House Democrats' obstruction of Congress' claim is frivolous and dangerous,\" the brief reads. \"House Democrats propose removing the president from office because he asserted legal rights and privileges of the executive branch against defective subpoenas \u2014 based on advice from the Department of Justice. Accepting that theory would do lasting damage to the separation of powers.\" The House managers prosecuting the case against the president will have the opportunity to respond to the White House's brief before\u00a0the Senate trial, which is expected to kick off Tuesday afternoon. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will preside over the proceedings.\u00a0 It remains to be seen whether enough senators will vote to call witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, who has said he would testify under subpoena.\u00a0 \"They didn't want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!\" the president tweeted Monday morning. House investigators requested Bolton's testimony in the early stages of the impeachment inquiry, and he declined to appear for a deposition or testify publicly.",

In the appearance with Charlamagne, the host asked Biden if he believes Democrats take black voters for granted, and Biden noted that he had overwhelmingly won the black vote\u00a0in the South Carolina primary.\u00a0 \"I won every single county. I won the largest share of the black vote that anybody had, including Barack,\" he said. But despite Biden's past victories, Johnson said the Biden campaign has \"more work\" to do.\u00a0 \"We cannot take the black vote for granted. It is the vote that brought him this far \u2014 I think he recognizes that, and there has to be stronger preparation when you go on platforms like 'The Breakfast Club,' because it is an aggressive platform, but it's also a platform where many a millennial and younger African American voters listen to, and it will and can leave an impression.\" After Johnson's interview, Biden expressed regret about his remarks, saying he \"should not have been so cavalier\" on the show. \"I've never, never, ever taken the African American community for granted,\" he said.\u00a0 Biden's senior adviser Symone D. Sanders wrote on Twitter that his comments \"were in jest.\" \"He was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump's any day. Period,\" she said.\u00a0 MORE: \"I shouldn't have been such a wise guy,\" @JoeBiden said later in the call with the @usblackchambers \"I shouldn't have been so cavalier. ... No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background.\" Johnson also spoke about the NAACP's We Are Done Dying campaign that encourages people to contact their representatives if they are frustrated by the disparity of deaths and economic inequality suffered by the African American community.\u00a0 According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"as of April 18, when comparing to residents who live in COVID-NET counties, non-Hispanic Black people were disproportionately hospitalized with COVID-19.\" The NAACP's campaign was launched in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but Johnson said its need has been tragically reaffirmed by the shooting deaths of African Americans Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor.\u00a0 \"Recent incidents are reminiscent of an atrocious era of hate and domestic terrorism where police officers and white protesters routinely brutalized African-Americans,\" reads the organization's website. \"The senseless death displays the continuance of systematic racism and privilege granted to white people in America.\" Johnson said he wishes public health experts, not politicians, would lead a national conversation about the disproportionate effect the pandemic has taken on the communities of color.\u00a0 \"We are losing individuals for reasons that can be avoided,\" he said.",

MCMASTER: Hey Michael, the honor's mine is great to be with you.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORRELL: Let me start with a couple of points for our listeners. First, I want to congratulate you on your new book, Battlegrounds: 'The Fight to Defend the Free World.' I've read it. It's terrific. I think it's a must read for anyone interested in national security. And I actually see it as a reference book for understanding the key issues. And I see myself pulling it down off the shelf from time to time. When I'm thinking about something, I want to have to talk about something, when I'm writing something. I think it's a very important contribution to the literature on the threats and challenges we face as a nation. So thank you. Thank you very much for writing it. GEN. MCMASTER: Well, Michael, thanks so much. I mean it, somebody with your background, experience and knowledge to to endorse it like that. That means a lot to me that you judge it to have been worthwhile. Thank you. MICHAEL MORRELL: Second, having you with us to talk about your book is a perfect way for us to kick off what is for us,\u00a0 going to be a new series on the key national security issues facing the United States. The series, which we're going to work very hard to be nonpartisan, will run between the election and the inauguration. And finally, I should mention to my listeners that this episode is going to run the day after the election, but that you and I are taping it the Friday before the election. So you and I have no idea what's going to happen on Election Day. So people should just know that as they're as they're listening to our conversation. And I think that's actually a good thing for our conversation, because what I want to do at the end of the day is get your sense of what is going to face the president who is sworn in on January 20th, no matter who that person happens to be. MICHAEL MORRELL: H.R. before we get to the individual issues that I want to walk through with you, I'd love to ask you why you decided to write the book that you did. You obviously could have written a very different kind of book. And I'm sure that there were publishers who were encouraging you to do that. But you chose not to do that. You chose to write a very serious look at the threats and challenges that face us as a nation. Why did you take the route that you did? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, Michael, thank you. I served in the Army for thirty four years. So as I transitioned to what is my only second career in my adult life, I made out probably quite predictably, a mission statement for myself. And that was in my second career to try to deepen our understanding of the most crucial challenges we face as a way to better inform the American people about foreign policy and national security issues, and with the hope that if we learn more about these challenges that we face, we can demand better. Demand a better foreign policy from our elected leaders. But then also, I hope that the book and the work that I'm doing around the book will help bring Americans back together. Right. Because I don't think any of these issues should be partisan in nature. What I'm hoping for is that a deeper understanding of these challenges we face. And I think what should be our common commitment to try to build a better future for generations to come will help bring our country back together, at least around foreign policy and national security issues. MICHAEL MORRELL: H.R., what are the main themes of the book? What do you want readers to walk away remembering? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, what are the themes that runs through the book is this idea of strategic narcissism. I think this is one of the reasons why our competence, our ability to compete, at least in the post-Cold War period, has been significantly diminished. And by strategic narcissism, I mean, our tendency to define the world only in relation to us and then to assume that what we decide to do or decide not to do is decisive to achieving a favorable outcome. And of course, you know, Michael, with your long experience with intelligence, this is flawed because it's self-referential and it doesn't acknowledge, you know, the degree to which others have agency and influence and authorship over the future. So the book is then an argument, an argument for cultivating with my friend and great historian Zachary Shore has termed strategic empathy. And this is an effort, an effort to understand better what drives and constrains the other. Especially adversaries, rivals and enemies and what drives and constrains the other often times is ideology and emotion and aspirations. So the theme in the book that also is important is an effort to understand how the recent past produced the present as the first step in making a projection into the future. So the book is an argument for the understanding of history and appreciation for the complex causality of events and a focus on understanding these crucial challenges we're facing from the perspective from the perspective of others. MICHAEL MORRELL: You know, that's one of the that's one of the main jobs of the intelligence community. Right? Is to is to give our decision makers the point of view of the other guy. The guy sitting across the table from you, the guy sitting across the battlefield from you. But what's the other guy thinking? What are his constraints? What are his interests? And that's extraordinarily important. Right? GEN. MCMASTER:\u00a0 Of course, it's not a new idea. It goes back to Sun Tzu, but I think it's we started to neglect the importance of this, especially in the post-Cold War period, a period that I describe as a period of over optimism. Over optimism that led to complacency and a bit of hubris. And this over optimism was in large measure a set up, I think a set of for significant disappointments in the two thousands disappointments, of course, associated with the mass murder attacks of September 11th, 2001, but also the unanticipated length and difficulty of wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq and, of course, followed by a financial crisis. And so I think it was in the two thousands that this emotional impetus behind our foreign policy shifted from overoptimism to pessimism and from maybe a tendency to under appreciate the risks and costs of action, to a tendency to underappreciate the risks and costs of inaction. And I think that strategic narcissism is the cause, really, in both cases. MICHAEL MORRELL: You know, the other thing that strikes me when you talk about the importance of history is I always thought sitting in deputies meetings that it would have been incredibly valuable to actually take a few minutes and every deputies meetings or principals meetings to talk about the history of the issue, just to review how you got from point A to point B, and we never did that in multiple administrations in which I served, but I always thought that that would have been really valuable. GEN. MCMASTER: \u00a0Well, Michael, you're absolutely right about that. I'll tell you, one of the one of the great gifts I had, I think before earlier my career was the opportunity to read things, study and write history. And the first book I wrote was Dereliction of Duty, which is a story about how and why Vietnam became an American war.\u00a0 And one of the lessons I learned from the study of that history was that it was important to understand problems and challenges holistically before leaping into action. When I came in as national security adviser, I did my best to at least avoid making the same mistakes and we put in place a principle small group framing session. I know that's a mouthful, but as we developed these strategies for the most crucial challenges we were facing, we began with this framing session that was organized around a five page paper that included only really the description of the challenge. How we got to where we are, a bit of the history of it, and then an inventory of our vital interests that were at stake, view of that challenge through the lens of those vital interests and draft overarching goals and more specific objectives, followed by assumptions.\u00a0 Assumptions about the degree to which we and like-minded partners have agency or influence over this challenge. Then an inventory of obstacles to progress and opportunities that we could exploit. And that's it. Then we had a discussion about the nature of the challenge. First, the policy coordinating committee, which, you know, are the real workers who are going to work on this project. They're listening in. So they're getting, they're hearing at the cabinet level, a discussion about the nature of the problem and then a refinement of it. Once that part of the meeting was done, then we shifted to a discussion of what are your ideas? How do we integrate the elements of national power and efforts of like-minded partners to overcome these obstacles and exploit these opportunities? Then they got to hear the Treasury secretary say what we have. We have economic and financial tools available. But those ought to be combined with diplomacy and maybe law enforcement efforts. And then you get this rich discussion that then the policy coordinating committee can really run with. So I think that, I hope that's a process that will be sustained. I don't think my successor hung onto it. It will have to be resurrected at some point if it is deemed as useful by a future national security adviser. MICHAEL MORRELL: I'm Michael Morrell today, we have with us H.R. McMaster, a Senior Fellow at both Stanford University's Hoover Institution and its Graduate School of Business. A career U.S. Army officer and national security adviser to President Trump. OK, so what I'd love to do is go through the individual issues. And what I'd like to do is just throw one out, get you to frame it. What's the threat or challenge that we face? What's the history? How did we get here? What's our interest that's at stake? And how do you think we as a nation need to go about dealing with it? Let's start with the big one. Let's start with the big enchilada, China. GEN. MCMASTER: I think China is a great example of strategic narcissism at work, and especially this assumption that we clung to for too long, that China, having been welcomed into the international order, would play by the rules, would liberalize its economy, and as it prospered, it would liberalize its form of government. Of course, that's not true. That's not true because we undervalue the degree to which emotions and ideology drive and constrain the Chinese Communist Party. And what I would argue in battlegrounds is that the party is driven mainly by fear, fear of losing its exclusive grip on power and an associated ambition. The ambition to achieve national rejuvenation for China to take center stage in the world again after the tragedy, as they portrayed as the century of humiliation. It is that combination of fear and aspiration that is driving the party's effort to extend and tighten its exclusive grip on power internally. This is why there are over a million people in concentration camps in Xinjiang and there's a campaign of cultural genocide ongoing.\u00a0 This is why the party is extending their repressive arm to Hong Kong and perfecting their technologically enabled Orwellian surveillance police state. This is what we're seeing and then what is even more troubling, I think, is the parties now effort to export its authoritarian mercantilist model.\u00a0 Through a number of strategies that aim to create servile relationships with countries and then ultimately through economic means, as well as the growth in the People's Liberation Army's capabilities to establish areas of privacy across the new Pacific region that exclude the United States and then it challenged the United States in the free world globally. If China succeeds, I mean, our world will be less free, less prosperous and less safe. So the stakes are high and it's past time for us to recognize the need to compete effectively against this this very integrated and pernicious form of aggression that the parties engaged in. MICHAEL MORRELL: What would an effective China strategy look like to you? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, I think the Trump administration, if it gets credit for anything, should get credit for a fundamental shift in our policy toward China. One that was long overdue and one that I think is fundamentally sound and this is the idea that we have to compete. And it was under the strategy of of cooperation and engagement that the Chinese Communist Party was emboldened. Competition doesn't need to lead to confrontation. In fact, quite the opposite. And I think we have returned to arenas of competition involving countering more effectively China's campaign of sustained industrial espionage against us, countering a range of China's unfair trade and economic practices, doing so in large measure through effective international cooperation, for example, establishing better standards for infrastructure investment internationally, the law enforcement actions and investigations that have gone on against APT10.\u00a0 The main hacking arm of the Chinese Communist Party, I think have been very effective as well, combined with sanctions and other actions against the aggressive arms of the party. But really, I think the most important thing for us to do, and I argue this in a chapter battlegrounds entitled Turning Weakness into Strength is to take what the Chinese Communist Party sees as sources of weakness potentially for them and turn those into our greatest strengths. What does the party fear? The party fears that the people, the Chinese people, might want to have a say in how they're governed so we should strengthen our democratic processes. The party fears rule of law. We should strengthen rule of law in the United States and with countries that are working to strengthen rule of law in their countries, the party fears freedom of press, freedom of the expression. We need to strengthen our authoritative sources of information and recognize that investigative journalism is a great counter to some of these pernicious strategies that the parties are pursuing. So I think that part of it is defensive, but part of it is more introspective and trying to maintain our competitive advantages. MICHAEL MORRELL: This is Intelligence Matters. I'm Michael Morrell. We're talking with former national security adviser H.R. McMaster. So Russia, how do you think about Russia? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, Russia is a significant threat to us because Putin again, is examining the assumptions of previous policies. Putin is not going to become like the Grinch on Christmas Eve. Right, his heart is not going to get too big as the size gets bigger and he's not going to decide, OK, well maybe the future of Russia does lie more with the West and treat the United States and Europe and others differently. Putin is driven by a sense of honor lost after the breakup of the Soviet Union. He is also driven by this associated desire to restore Russia to national greatness. He's also cognizant, though, of the fact that he cannot compete with this on our own terms. And so what his theory of victory is, is to drag us all down and then to be the last man standing and the means that he's using to do this. I describe the Chinese approach of cooption, coercion and concealment. And I use alliteration in the Russian chapters as well.\u00a0 It is a campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial to try to disrupt us, to disrupt our effective governance, to disrupt us economically and to use economic coercion when he can, such as he has done in Europe effectively from time to time and with energy dependence. Then to deny even his most egregious acts, especially the sustained campaign of cyber enabled information warfare against us, which is designed to polarize us, to pit us against each other, to reduce our confidence in who we are as a people and in our democratic institutions and principles and processes. Russia is a dangerous threat for for these reasons. And the best way to counter the first step is to pull the curtain back on this activity, to educate ourselves about it, to be less susceptible to Russian information, to not be our own worst enemies, as I think both political parties in many instances have because they compromise and they compromised our principles to score some partisan political points and in doing so, make themselves vulnerable to Russian disinformation and propaganda. MICHAEL MORRELL: Then what about raising the cost to him of doing this? Is that an option here in terms of deterring him? GEN. MCMASTER: Absolutely. This is what I advocated for in battlegrounds is that we have to impose costs on the Kremlin, on Putin, that exceed those that he factors in at the beginning of his decision making process. It was my last day really in an Oval Office meeting, it was the day that President Trump decided to impose significant costs on Russia in response to the attempted\u00a0 poisoning, murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with with a banned military grade nerve agent and an act that put thousands of UK citizens at risk. And it was at that on that occasion that we expelled you over 60 undeclared intelligence agents that hits Putin where it matters. Because these are agents that were critical to his sustained campaign of subversion against us. And we impose significant costs, additional costs on Russia through sanctions and other actions, the closing of the San Francisco consulate, as you know, Michael, was a major intelligence collection platform for the Russians here in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. So, that was significant and I think that sent a strong message. Now, after Navalny's poisoning, I'd like to see us do the same thing, you know, and as he's infiltrating more little green men now into Belarus and as he continues to enable the serial episodes of mass homicide, that is the Syrian civil war, to support Hawthorne's way perpetuating violence in Libya.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORRELL: I'm Michael Morell. We're talking with H.R. McMaster, Former National Security Adviser to President Trump and author of the just published book Battlegrounds: 'The Fight to Defend the Free World.' By the way, if you missed any of today's show, you can listen to it as a podcast. Just search Intelligence Matters wherever you get your podcasts. Let's talk about North Korea. Give us your sense on North Korea? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, thanks, Michael. Of course, it's important for us to recognize going in right that North Korea is the only communist hereditary dictatorship in the world. And it is the nature of the Kim family regime that we have to take into account when we're considering the danger that the regime poses to the world if it does possess the most destructive weapons on Earth. The Kim family regime is driven mainly by this drive to remain in power. It is, of course, known as the hermit kingdom. It is a gulag state that fears any kind of opening to the world. And it is a regime that across now three generations of dictators has been committed to unifying the Korean peninsula under the so-called red banner. And I think as we look at North Korea's pursuit of the most destructive weapons on Earth, we have to be at least open to the possibility that it wants those weapons to coerce the United States off the peninsula as the first step in the forcible reunification of the peninsula. And, of course, that would that would be the form of a destructive war. GEN. MCMASTER: It's also important, I think, for us to recognize that it is highly unlikely that North Korea wants nuclear weapons just to deter us. North Korea already had a very significant deterrence capability with its conventional weapons. And the fact that it's so many thousands of artillery pieces are within the range of of Seoul, South Korea. And then also, I think it's important to recognize that every act of aggression on the Korean peninsula since the North invaded the South in June of 1950 has been initiated by the north. The other aspect of this problem, Michael, that is very important to consider is that if North Korea gets the weapon is recognized as a as a nuclear power, like who doesn't get one after that? Right. This Japan starts to have conversation with South Korea. By the way, North Korea never met a weapon it didn't try to sell to somebody excluding its nuclear program until the Israeli Defense Force bombed that facility in 2007. So it's very dangerous. I think it's dangerous as well because of the ideology that drives this regime. It's a warped ideology. This is the Zushi ideology which has turned deprivation into a sign of virtue and racial superiority. And the North Korean people have gone through generations of brainwashing. So this is a big problem, Michael. I think that the approach that is in place now, the strategy of maximum pressure, it's the best course of action. I think we have to test the thesis that maximum pressure can convince Kim Jong un that he is safer without the weapons than he is with them. I think it will be important for whoever is sworn in on January 20th that they recognize that we should not repeat the failed pattern of previous efforts, not allow North Korea to draw us into negotiations with an act of aggression and with the demands of big payoff up front just for the privilege of talking with them. To not again, engage in long, drawn out negotiations that delivers a weak agreement that he immediately breaks again. MICHAEL MORRELL: You've said something here that I think is really important, because I think the conventional wisdom is that he wants these weapons for deterrence. Right. That he's worried about us attacking him. But you're arguing that it's more than that. That this gets to the heart of what North Korea has always wanted, which is to reunify the peninsula, which I think is a really important point here that changes how you think about how you have to deal with him? GEN. MCMASTER: This is an argument, Michael, for strategic empathy. Right? To view these complex challenges from the perspective of the other and unless you do that,\u00a0 you're susceptible to mirror imaging. And, of course, my research for the book, Dereliction of Duty, you know that sensitized me to this. It was in the run up to the Vietnam War where some of those who were planning the Vietnam strategy development, the strategy actually referred to the reasonable man theory of English common law and assumed that Ho Chi Minh would respond as the theoretical reasonable man. Would respond without taking into consideration the role that culture and ideology played in driving and constraining the North Vietnamese leadership. MICHAEL MORRELL: Do you think at the end of the day it's possible to convince him that he would be better off, that he would be more secure without these weapons? GEN. MCMASTER: I do think it's possible, and the reason I think it's possible because we've never really put maximum pressure on the north. And so we have this opportunity now thanks really to the tremendous work by Ambassador Nikki Haley when she was at the U.N. As you know, Michael, these U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea are unprecedented and reach. The key now, though, is to enforce them. Of course, the key country that needs to enforce them is China. And I think if China doesn't enforce them, if China continues to be complicit with illicit financial flows into and out of the country, to continue to provide energy and other materials to the north that are limited by these sanctions. Then I think it's time for us to consider secondary sanctions and maybe on Chinese financial institutions. GEN. MCMASTER: I think as we see the smuggling of coal and the transshipment of coal and oil and fuel, I think that under Article two, I think the president could use Article two authority to interdict those ships. As you know, Michael, this is something we can't really talk about. There are other means of putting pressure on the north. I think that we haven't done it yet. I think we have to at least test the thesis because the alternatives are so bleak of either accepting North Korea as a nuclear power and coping with that threat or a war. Right. That would be very costly, I think it's worth pursuing. MICHAEL MORRELL: We still have more to discuss with General McMaster and we'll be right back with our final segment.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORRELL: We're back with more intelligence matters, I'm Michael Morrell. Our guest is H.R. McMaster, Senior Fellow at both Stanford University's Hoover Institution and its Graduate School of Business. So, sir, let me ask you about another tough one, Iran. GEN. MCMASTER: On Iran, what I tell the story of in Battlegrounds, Michael, is we have to view the problem of Iran with two fundamental considerations foremost in our minds. The first is the ideology of the revolution and how that drives Iranian leadership and the Iranian leadership is the Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. We have this fantasy I think that the reformers, the Republicans, within Iraq are going to prevail. They lost, the revolutionaries are in charge. The hardliners are in charge. And whenever they put this forward, the shop window of Minister Zarif, their Foreign Minister or President Rouhani, that's all you're getting is the shop window. That ideology is it drives the Iranian regime to continue its four decade long proxy war against the Great Satan, the United States, the little Satan, Israel, the Arab monarchies and the West broadly. And so we have to consider the ideology of the regime and and this 40 year long proxy war. GEN. MCMASTER: What I argue for in the book is to force the Iranian regime to make a choice. You can either be treated like a normal nation or you can continue to wage this proxy war, to support terrorist organizations and keep the Middle East enmeshed in this perpetual state of sectarian civil war. The choice is yours, and to impose that choice, I think what we should not do is lift the arms embargo to the regime. What we should not do is lift any of the sanctions. In fact, we should impose the costs on the regime to constrain the resources they have available to continue their proxy wars against us, but then also ultimately maybe to convince the Iranian people. That they ought to have a government in place and I'm not talking about like a 2003 regime change, but a government in place that shifts away from its permanent hostility to the United States, Israel and the West. I think that's the only path that I see forward. I think our policies ought to aim to effect that change in the regimes permanent hostility. And until it does any agreement with them, it can't be trusted and any agreement with them that allows them to escape. Making that choice like the Iran nuclear deal did, I think is to our disadvantage. MICHAEL MORRELL: So you don't see the regime changing policy on its own. Do you think that has to be forced internally by the Iranian people? Is that fair? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, Michael, I think on Iran, it's important to keep two considerations in mind in crafting a strategy toward Iran. First of all, that it's the ideology of the regime that drives their hostile behavior toward us. And we have to recognize that it's the Supreme Leader, it's the Guardian Council, its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who are in charge. Right. There was a struggle, you know, across the history of Iran since the revolution in 1979 between the Republicans and the revolutionaries. Hey, the revolutionaries won. And and we have to recognize that the second consideration is that this regime has waged a four decade long proxy war against the Great Satan, us, the little Satan, Israel, the Arab monarchies and the West generally. We have to craft our strategy in recognition of this regime's permanent hostility to us. Of course, I think the best way to approach it in the title of the chapter in Battlegrounds is forcing a choice, forcing the regime to make a choice of either being a responsible nation and then being treated as such or suffering the consequences. And this is why I think it's very important to keep the arms embargo in place. I think it's very important to keep the sanctions in place on the regime to, in the short term, reduce the resources it has available to wage this proxy war and in the long term, hopefully convince the Iranian people to demand a change in the nature of the government such that it ceases as permanent hostility. MICHAEL MORRELL: Okay, Islamic extremism, it's waned a bit in the threat, but it's still there. From West Africa, to the Middle East, to South Asia, to Southeast Asia. How do you think about that problem long term?\u00a0 GEN. MCMASTER: I think the reason that we haven't had another attack on the scale of the most devastating terrorist attack in history of September 11th, 2001, is our tremendous intelligence professionals, our diplomats, our military who's been engaged against this threat from jihadist terrorist organizations since 9/11. What I'm concerned about, Michael, is that these groups, I think are more dangerous today than they were maybe even on September 10th, 2001. And that's because, of course, those who committed the mass murder attacks against us on 9/11 were the mujahideen alumni of the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Well, now the al-Qaida alumni, the ISIS alumni, the Lashkar-e-Taiba alumni are orders of magnitude greater and they have access to more and more destructive capabilities. And the reason we've been safe is because we've been engaged and now we have this narrative of ending endless wars and disengaging. Well, I think what Americans need to know is that we are engaged so we can enable others to bear the brunt of this fight. I mean, this disengagement from Afghanistan, I think is a tragedy. The way that we've gone about this, I think we should recognize the sacrifices of our longest war and in particular that 10 of our courageous servicemen, soldiers, gave their lives for our country, our security this year. But we have to also recognize that 30 Afghan soldiers and police a day die defending the freedoms that they've enjoyed since the defeat of the Taliban in 2001 a removal of the Taliban from power. So I think that we need to make a sustained argument to the American people for engagement with this problem of jihadist terrorism. Because if we don't, Michael, we'll go back to 1998. Remember when we after the embassy bombings, we fired a few cruise missiles and called it a day. Right, that didn't work out. MICHAEL MORRELL: The last issue I want to ask you about is Venezuela, which I know you care about. My understanding is that when you arrived at the White House, you were going over the issues and you kind of stumbled on Venezuela and said, hey, you know what's going on there? That doesn't look like we're paying attention to this, talk about Venezuela and why it's important? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, it's immensely important because this is a humanitarian catastrophe in Venezuela. It's a humanitarian catastrophe that's brought on by an authoritarian regime that is denying the Venezuelan people a say in how they're governed. When we looked at the problem and the nature of the Maduro regime and the Chavista movement, we concluded that this was, again, a corrupt government that is using criminalized patronage networks to effect control of its people. It uses these motorcycle gangs and militias to overwhelm any kind of opposition. It ended the Constitution. So we said what's should our goal be? Our goal should be to work with others, to work with like-minded countries, to effect a restoration of constitutional rule in Venezuela. And to do that, we felt as if we had to pursue three objectives. One of those objectives would be to try to strengthen the opposition. Right. To help the opposition come together. I think you saw that with the rise of Bolsonaro. You know, who was really from the people. You know, he's not a member of the Caracas Polo Club, for example. I think he's somebody who can gain some traction with those who have been disadvantaged now so significantly under Ch\u00e1vez, and now Maduro. GEN. MCMASTER: The second objective would be for the people to be able to attribute their grievances back to the government, not to blame the Yankees, you know, for example. And the third related to that would be to try to galvanize really popular support for restoration of constitutional government. I think the measures we put in place were sound. Of course, they have proven inadequate. And I think we thought that economic sanctions would maybe have a significant effect. But the reason they haven't had a bigger effect is there's a huge black market, illicit economy that's run by Maduro. He uses that to sustain this criminalized patronage network and these gangs of thugs who really prevent any real opposition from gaining traction. But I think I'm proud of what we did in this period of time. We worked very closely with partners, especially in the Western Hemisphere, Mexico, under the foreign minister of the great Luis Videgaray, who was a wonderful partner, took a leading role in much of the work that we did. We try'd to get the Organization of American States and others to do more. But it was really the community of like-minded nations Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Panama, Argentina. We worked very closely together on this problem and I think remain committed to trying to effect a restoration of constitutional government in Venezuela. MICHAEL MORRELL: You've been fantastic with your time. I just want to ask you two more questions, we have a couple of minutes left, so we'll need to be quick here. MICHAEL MORRELL: The first is that in order to deal with all of these problems that you've talked about, you know, we need a healthy national security toolkit. Healthy diplomacy, healthy intelligence capabilities, healthy military capabilities. What's your assessment sort of overall of where we are with our national security toolkit? GEN. MCMASTER: I think we're in good shape thanks to the extremely dedicated civil servants and military professionals, intelligence professionals who we have across our government. But I think what is needed more than anything is a higher degree of what I argue in Battlegrounds is, strategic competence, and that's the ability to integrate the elements of national power so that they're applied in a way that are synergistic. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I think at times we get it right, but most often we get it wrong. And our approach to these complex problems is fragmented. It's inconsistent. It's as I mentioned, you know, based on flawed assumptions about the nature of the problem. I think what I would like to see as well these days is even more of a concerted effort to foster multinational cooperation as I write in Battlegrounds. I mean, none of these problems are solvable by any one country. So it's very important for us to create the right venues for us to come together. Not only to work on a discrete issue or event together, but really to think about these complex challenges. To frame them together and then to apply our competitive advantages between our like minded countries. So that we do have a synergistic effect and and so that we can build a better future for generations to come. MICHAEL MORRELL: The last question, I think anybody who's listened to the podcast up to this point is going to think, wow, that is a hard, tough list. I wonder at the end of the day, if you're optimistic or if you are pessimistic that we're going to get this right going forward. GEN. MCMASTER: Michael, I'm optimistic about it. I'm optimistic about it even as we emerge from this\u00a0 triple crisis. Of the pandemic, the recession associated with it and the divides in our society, laid bare by George Floyds murder and the protests and civil unrest that followed it. I think what's great about our democracy is we are self-correcting. The American people have a say in how they're governed. They can demand better. And the reason I wrote Battlegrounds is I think if the American people understand these challenges, they will demand a better foreign policy from from our elected leaders. You know, our founders knew that our democracy was going to require continuous nurturing. It's still true today. And I believe that we do have significant problems at home. But we also have to confront these challenges abroad because we know from the COVID-19 pandemic that problems that develop abroad can only be dealt with at an exorbitant price once they reach our shores. So the argument of battlegrounds is an argument for sustained engagement with the world. MICHAEL MORRELL: The book is Battlegrounds: 'The Fight to Defend the Free World.' The author is H.R. McMaster. General, thank you very much for joining us today. GEN. MCMASTER: Michael, thank you for the privilege of being with you. And thanks for your service.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Republican Senator Susan Collins says she is working with a \"fairly small group\" of GOP senators to allow witnesses in the impending impeachment trial of President Trump. Collins, who is one of the more moderate Republicans in the Senate, is running for re-election in a closely watched Senate race this year. According to the Bangor Daily News, Collins told reporters Friday that she was working with this cadre of fellow senators to ensure that House impeachment managers and the president's lawyers would be able to call witnesses in the trial, saying \"we should be completely open to calling witnesses.\" \"I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement on how to proceed with the trial that will allow the opportunity for both the House and the president's counsel if they choose to do so,\" Collins said. Collins' remarks followed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's\u00a0announcement\u00a0that the House will be voting next week on a resolution to designate impeachment managers \u2014 who will prosecute the case against Mr. Trump \u2014 and to deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Pelosi has been withholding the articles from the Senate, saying she needs to see the rules for the trial set by the Senate before the House delivers the articles. Democrats maintain that the Senate needs to hear from new witnesses and admit new evidence to ensure a fair trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't want to include new witnesses and documents in the vote on the rules for the Senate trial. He'd prefer to vote on the rules and then hear the opening arguments from the House impeachment managers and President Trump's defense team before voting on calling witnesses or considering new evidence.\u00a0 McConnell\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he has enough GOP support to move forward with the approach he prefers. The vote on the resolution determining the rules of the trial will, according to McConnell, mirrors the procedures used in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Under the resolution, House impeachment managers and the president's defense team would deliver opening statements before the Senate would vote on whether to call witnesses or consider new evidence. Senate Democrats want to call four witnesses from the administration, among them, former national security adviser John Bolton. Bolton said earlier this week that he's \"prepared to testify\" before the Senate if he's subpoenaed. But that won't happen if the president prevails. In an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Mr. Trump said he could invoke executive privilege to keep Bolton from testifying \u2014 \"I think you have to for the sake of the office,\" Mr. Trump told Ingraham when she asked if he would invoke the privilege to stop Bolton.\u00a0 But there are witnesses the president wants to hear from, too, like the whistleblower who prompted the impeachment inquiry, as well as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter. Most Senate Republicans are less likely to want to hear from them.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the president's legal team for impeachment appears to be set. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone will be the president's lead counsel, and Mr. Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow will also defend the president in the Senate. White House counsel deputies Patrick Philbin and Mike Purpura will also aid the defense team.\u00a0 Without having the articles of impeachment, McConnell has yet to disclose what dates a Senate trial will take place. Whatever the case, a trial will take place in the heat of the 2020 Democratic primary season, with the Iowa caucuses just weeks away. Several Democratic senators will have to take time away from the campaign trail to serve as jurors in the political trial.\u00a0 \u2014 CBS News' Paula Reid contributed to this report\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "best female R&B/pop artistNew York \u2014 The BET Awards served as an extension of the voices of black people protesting in the streets about the inequalities black people face daily, as artists used their performances to highlight the Black Lives Matter movement, civil rights and lives lost because of the actions of police officers, including George Floyd's. DaBaby, with his face pressed against the ground as an officer's knee crippled his neck - replicating the last moments of Floyd's life - rapped a verse from the Black Lives Matter remix of his hit song \"Rockstar.\" His performance also featured images from protests, a reflection of the current world in the wake of Floyd's death and the death of others, including Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.  Sunday's show, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic, featured a number of highly produced, well-crafted and pre-taped performances.\u00a0 It kicked off with black artists rapping and singing anthems about the black experience and fighting for equal rights.  Twelve-year-old sensation Keedron Bryant, who turned heads on social media with his passionate performance about being a young black man in today's world, started the show with an a cappella performance of his poignant song \"I Just Wanna Live,\" which earned him a record deal. That was followed by an all-star performance of Public Enemy's 1989 anthem \"Fight the Power,\" featuring Nas, black Thought, Rapsody and YG adding new lyrics to the song, even namedropping Taylor and others.  Michelle Obama highlighted Beyonc\u00e9's commitment to the black community before presenting her with the humanitarian award, saying, \"You can see it in everything she does, from her music that gives voice to black joy and black pain, to her activism that demands justice for black lives.\"  Beyonc\u00e9 used her speech to encourage viewers to vote \"like our life depends on it\" in the upcoming election.   \"I want to dedicate this award to all of my brothers out there, all of my sisters out there inspiring me, marching and fighting for change. Your voices are being heard and you're proving to our ancestors that their struggles were not in vain. Now we have one more thing we need to do to walk in our true power, and that is to vote,\" she said. \"There are people banking on us staying at home during local elections and primaries happening in states across the country. We have to vote like our life depends on it, because it does.\"  Sunday's show celebrated BET's 20th awards show and BET's 40th year as a network. The three-hour event, which aired on CBS for the first time, was hosted by comedian, actress and TV personality Amanda Seales, who starred in several skits, including one about women who identify as \"Karen,\" a common stereotype and term for racist and privileged white women.  Other artists were political during their performances, including Roddy Ricch, who wore a Black Lives Matter shirt while he rapped, Alicia Keys, Anderson Paak and Jay Rock, as well as brothers SiR and D Smoke, who performed with their mother Jackie Gouch\u00e9.  Lil Wayne paid tribute to NBA icon Kobe Bryant, who died in January, with a performance of his 2009 song \"Kobe Bryant,\" weaving in new lyrics. Wayne Brady, in a glittery suit, rolled around on top of a piano as he sang a medley of Little Richard hits.  Nipsey Hussle, who was named best male hip-hop artist and earned the humanitarian award at last year's BET Awards, won video of the year for \"Higher,\" a clip he filmed with DJ Khaled and John Legend shortly before he died .  \"This is for Nipsey Hussle and hip-hop,\" Khaled said in a taped video. \"Nipsey Hussle, thank you for working with me on this 'Higher' record. I appreciate you. Nipsey's family, we love you.\"  The BET Awards, one of the first awards shows to air virtually, featured performances that were sharp with artsy stage production, giving extra life to the songs being performed. It was a welcome break from the \"living room\" and homebound performances hundreds of artists have shared on social media since the pandemic hit in March.  Chloe x Halle, who have successfully performed for various TV shows and events during the pandemic while promoting their new album, gave an epic performance of their songs \"Do It\" and \"Forgive Me.\" R&B star Summer Walker, who played guitar and sang, was also impressive during her performance, which featured Usher.   Megan Thee Stallion went to the desert with background dancers as she twerked and rapped her No. 1 hit \"Savage.\" She won best female hip-hop artist, beating out Cardi B and Nicki Minaj.  \"Oh my God, I probably recorded this video like 10 times. It feels so crazy doing this from my house,\" she said. \"I used to watch the BET Awards all the time thinking, 'One day that's going to be me going up there accepting my award' - and now it is.\"  Though the BET Awards are technically about handing out trophies, the awards were an afterthought. During the live telecast, Ricch won album of the year for his debut \"Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial\"; Lizzo was named best female R&B/pop artist; and Burna Boy won best international act. Overall, Chris Brown, Beyonc\u00e9 and Ricch were the night's big winners, taking home two honors each. Beyonc\u00e9 won the BET HER award for \"Brown Skin Girl,\" shared with daughter Blue Ivy Carter as well as Wizkid and Saint JHN. The song also won Beyonc\u00e9 and Blue Ivy a Soul Train Music Award last year. -- BET and CBS News are both part of ViacomCBS",

            "article_content": "President Trump on Friday became the first sitting president to speak at the annual March for Life rally \u2014 a visible show of support for those who want to restrict abortion access. The event comes six weeks before Supreme Court arguments in one of the most important abortion cases since Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide.  Mr. Trump has in the past called himself \"very pro-choice,\" but since becoming president has identified as \"pro-life\" and pushed policies that support efforts to limit abortion.  \"From the appointment of pro-life judges and federal workers, to cutting taxpayer funding for abortions here and abroad, to calling for an end to late-term abortions, President Trump and his administration have been consistent champions for life and their support for the March for Life has been unwavering,\" said Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, in a statement announcing the appearance. On the campaign trail in March 2016, Mr. Trump even said that \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women who receive abortions if the procedure were to become illegal, an idea he hasn't revisited since winning the election, after the idea was criticized even by conservatives.\u00a0 Mr. Trump announced he'd be attending the rally on Wednesday, the 47th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.\u00a0 Until this week, the highest-ranking White House official to attend March for Life was Vice President Mike Pence, who has gone every year since 2017. Other presidents have delivered remarks over the phone, but never attended in person. Friday's event will begin with a rally at noon at the National Mall, where a group of speakers, including Mr. Trump, will address the crowd. Attendees will then march down Constitution Avenue and end at the steps of the Supreme Court.  Abortion and access to the procedure have emerged as a major issue in the 2020 election. Planned Parenthood's political arm announced it plans to spend a record $45 million to elect politicians who support abortion access, while the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion advocacy group, plans to spend $52 million, the most it has ever spent on a single election.  The state lawmaker from Louisiana who wrote the bill at the center of the upcoming Supreme Court case will also be speaking. Representative Katrina Jackson introduced the state's \"Unsafe Abortion Protection Act,\" a 2014 law not currently in effect that requires abortion-providing doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. If the Supreme Court allows the law to go into effect, abortion access could be entirely eliminated in Louisiana.  In an exclusive interview with CBS News, Planned Parenthood's acting president Alexis McGill Johnson said she was worried about the upcoming case and warned that other states may follow. \"I think what it will do is actually emboldened state legislatures across the country to enact these similar bans and TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws around abortion providers,\" Johnson said on Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland, noting that the impact would \"effectively gut Roe.\" In a tweet Wednesday evening, Johnson addressed Mr. Trump's attendance at March for Life, writing, \"further confirmation that the sitting President of the United States is determined to end the American people's ability to access abortion.\" New data released on Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the majority of Americans supported abortion access. According to the report, 79% of those surveyed said they do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned and 63% said they personally knew someone who had an abortion. \"There's a vocal minority who control the levers of power and our work is to really shift those levers of power in 2020 to ensure that the will of the people actually remains the law of land,\" Johnson said. Support for abortion, however, depends on the trimester. A 2018 Gallup poll found six in 10 U.S. adults think abortion should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy. That support drops to 28% for abortions in the second trimester and 13% in the third trimester.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Manhattan's chief prosecutor can obtain troves of President Trump's business records and tax returns, a momentous defeat for the president in his efforts to shield his personal financial information from state investigators. The high court ruled 7-2 in favor of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who is conducting a criminal investigation into the president's business dealings and hush-money payments made to two women who allegedly had affairs with the president years before he was elected. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the high court by Mr. Trump, joined the majority, while Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The justices sent the dispute back to the lower courts for further proceedings. \"Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. \"We reaffirm that principle today and hold that the President is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need.\" Vance is seeking business records and tax returns dating back to 2011 from Mazars USA, Mr. Trump's longtime accounting firm. But the president and his attorneys had rebuffed Vance's efforts to obtain his financial information, arguing the president has \"absolute immunity\" from state criminal proceedings while in office. The high court, however, rejected Mr. Trump's assertion of absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas. In a statement after the ruling, Vance hailed the decision as \"a tremendous victory for our nation's system of justice and its founding principle that no one \u2014 not even a president \u2014 is above the law.\"\u00a0 \"Our investigation, which was delayed for almost a year by this lawsuit, will resume, guided as always by the grand jury's solemn obligation to follow the law and the facts, wherever they may lead,\" the district attorney said. Jay Sekulow, the president's personal attorney, said in a statement the legal team \"will now proceed to raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts.\" The White House said in a statement that with its ruling, the high court \"protected the president's financial records from intrusive subpoenas from a partisan district attorney.\" \"As the Court determined, the New York district attorney has not yet established his ability to secure access to those records,\" the White House said. \"Instead, further proceedings are required in the lower court in which the President can raise additional arguments, including constitutional protections, against this frivolous and politically motivated subpoena.\" Mr. Trump has gone to great lengths to shield his business records and tax returns from public view, mounting legal challenges to subpoenas issued by Vance and a trio of Democrat-led congressional committees for his personal information. While the president vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign to release his tax returns once an IRS audit was complete, he has not done so, raising questions from his political opponents as to whether the records would shed light on his vast business dealings. While the Supreme Court's ruling paves the way for Mazars to turn over the records sought by the Manhattan district attorney, it's unlikely that information will become public in the near future due to rules regarding secrecy of grand jury proceedings. The president has suffered numerous defeats in the federal courts in his efforts to block the subpoenas issued by Vance as part of his investigation. In November, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Mr. Trump's claims of immunity \"do not bar the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non-privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the president.\" The justices heard arguments in the case remotely by telephone in May, as the coronavirus pandemic forced the court to adjust the way it conducts its business. In addition to weighing the constitutionality of the subpoenas from Vance, the high court also considered the subpoenas from House Democrats for several years of Mr. Trump's financial records. In that legal battle, the Supreme Court sent the cases back to the lower courts, further ensuring the president's financial records will not be made public before the November election. The president reacted to the rulings on Twitter, saying the investigations were \"all a political prosecution.\" \"I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!\" he tweeted.\u00a0 The cases pitting Mr. Trump against congressional and state investigators were a test of the Supreme Court's new conservative majority, which has come under scrutiny from opponents who question whether they will exert independence from the president. Mr. Trump tapped two justices to the high court, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, shifting the high court rightward.",

            "article_content": "A company working with President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is defending a nearly $3 million loan it received from the federal\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief fund for small businesses, responding to criticism and a lawsuit accusing it of receiving preferential treatment. Phunware was eligible for the low-interest loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, which is aimed at businesses with 500 or fewer workers. The digital data company said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Monday that on March 27 it furloughed 34 full-time employees and three interns, leaving it with 54 full-time employees and one intern. Phunware's $2.85 million loan was nearly 14 times the current PPP average of $206,000.\u00a0 Former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters became Phunware's board chair on March 30. The company said in its statement Monday she was not involved in the PPP loan application. Phunware also said it has had a relationship with JPMorgan Chase since April 2017. It applied for the PPP loan through the bank on April 8 and received the money two days later. \"The company was pleased to have completed the application process with its lender without needing her involvement and has not compensated her, nor any other director for this outcome,\" the Phunware statement said. \"During this period, all board member cash compensation has been halted.\" The Austin American-Statesman reported Friday that Phunware tried several other banks before securing the loan through Chase, citing Phunware Chief Operating Officer Randall Crowder as its source for the information. \"While the company will work with its advisers to ensure its eligibility given changing guidelines, it currently believes that it remains fully eligible and compliant,\" Phunware said Monday of its low-interest PPP loan. Phunware also said it \"expects to have to repay its PPP loan at maturity, with loan proceeds in the interim being used for payroll costs, rent, utilities and employee retention.\" An expectation of repayment at loan maturity suggests Phunware may not meet one of the government's key requirements for complete loan forgiveness: using 75% of PPP loan funds to rehire furloughed workers and keep the employees on a company's payroll for eight weeks.\u00a0 Phunware was named in a federal lawsuit filed Friday in Illinois by a small business named Sha-Poppin Gourmet Popcorn, which applied for, but did not receive, a PPP loan. The suit accuses the company of receiving \"the white glove treatment from Chase.\" The lawsuit also names Ruth's Chris Steak House and JPMorgan Chase. Ruth's Chris, a national restaurant chain, initially accepted a $20 million PPP loan, but announced last week that it was returning the funding. JPMorgan Chase declined to\u00a0comment on the lawsuit.\u00a0 In its press release, Phunware said it \"intends to defend itself vigorously against the frivolous lawsuit claiming that by virtue of a privileged banking relationship it somehow harmed an unsuccessful applicant.\"\u00a0 \"Phunware had no control over any decisions of its lender, nor the SBA, in accepting its application,\" the company said. Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski declined to comment to CBS MoneyWatch on the Sha-Poppin lawsuit. Instead, he pointed in an email to development work he said the company has done for a division of CBS.

            "article_content": "The Democratic presidential debate circuit heads to Nevada tonight, three days before the state's caucuses on February 22. Beyond notoriously Nevada-specific issues (like Yucca Mountain),\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says candidates could face questions about communities in the\u00a0most diverse state so far\u00a0of the early nominating contests, where myriad outside groups have sought to capitalize on the campaign spotlight.  Latinx organizing and advocacy groups like Mi Familia Vota have been questioning candidates over the role of Latinos in their campaigns and potential presidencies, interviewing\u00a0Elizabeth Warren just this week\u00a0as she campaigned in the nearly one-third Hispanic state.\u00a0  AARP\u00a0has co-sponsored polling\u00a0in the state, which doesn't conduct many surveys, and where more than half\u00a0of 2016 caucus-goers\u00a0were 45 years of age or older. The Human Rights Campaign has ramped up a targeted volunteer and GOTV effort ahead of the caucus in Nevada, with paid staff on the ground organizing an estimated 127,000 LGBTQ caucus-goers throughout the state.\u00a0  In this special\u00a0DEBATE\u00a0edition of\u00a0Trail Markers, the\u00a0CBS News Political Unit\u00a0gives a rundown of what to expect from each of the candidates and other political news of the day.  JOE BIDEN  CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson:\u00a0While Joe Biden in recent weeks has focused on primarily contrasting himself with Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, his campaign \u2014 like others \u2014has been targeting Mike Bloomberg online.  On Wednesday morning, the Biden team released\u00a0an online video\u00a0criticizing Bloomberg's record. On a press call today, a senior Biden official said voters can expect to see this \"very sharp contrast\" on the debate stage as well.\u00a0  Visiting picketing hotel workers in Las Vegas, Biden previewed a potential one-liner for this evening: \"The truth is he's basically been a Republican his whole life. The fact of the matter is he didn't endorse Barack or me when we ran. This is a guy using Barack's pictures like, you know, they're good buddies. I'm going to talk about his record.\"\u00a0  In Nevada this week, Biden has focused his stump speech on health care and gun issues, which present two more potential points of contrast with Sanders. He questions the total price tag of \"Medicare for All\" proposals and tells his crowds he is defending President Obama's legacy by protecting the Affordable Care Act from attacks originating inside the White House and from pro-Medicare-for-All Democrats.\u00a0  On guns, Biden raises Sanders' votes against the Brady gun background check bill and his vote to exempt gun manufacturers from lawsuits. In powerful moments on the trail this week, Biden has brought up Sanders' gun record while referencing the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 dead.  WHAT TO WATCH: Can Biden project this intensity on stage tonight?  MIKE BLOOMBERG  CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry:\u00a0Mike Bloomberg makes his presidential debate stage debut in Las Vegas tonight. After a surge in his poll numbers amid an unprecedented amount of ad spending, he's expecting the knives to be out, since his fellow Democrats have already begun launching attacks at him before the candidates have taken the stage. Bloomberg, who qualified for the debate yesterday, is spending the day focused on debate prep, since he and his campaign know he's likely to be the prime target tonight.  While the campaign has kept quiet about its specific lines of attack, there are hints that the billionaire businessman has done his research. Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey offered a little insight on what to expect when he tweeted Tuesday that the opposition research on Sanders was \"damaging\" and \"perhaps even disqualifying.\"\u00a0  The campaign has made it no secret that a primary match-up with the Vermont senator is what they've counted on, and tonight, we can expect fireworks as the two face off with each other in person for the first time.\u00a0  Bloomberg's campaign hasn't discussed how long the former New York mayor has been preparing for the debate, but CBS News has learned through a campaign aide that he's been practicing in mock debate sessions with a mix of current campaign staffers and advisers who have worked with Bloomberg in the past, playing the roles of each of the candidates.\u00a0 His debate sessions are being run by Bradley Tusk, who ran Bloomberg's 2009 mayoral race and currently serves as an outside adviser.\u00a0 This will be the first time Bloomberg has appeared on a debate stage since October 2009.  WHAT TO WATCH: How will Bloomberg parry the attacks from every candidate on stage for his massive spending and controversial record on many hot-button topics? Will his debate performance affect his rise in the polls?  PETE BUTTIGIEG  CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman:\u00a0After the first two nominating contests, Buttigieg has a narrow delegate lead over Sanders. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana polled well in Iowa and New Hampshire, but his success there has not appeared to give him much of a boost in the next two states to vote, Nevada and South Carolina, both of which have more diverse electorates.\u00a0  In the week leading up to the Nevada caucuses, Buttigieg has drawn contrasts with Sanders, although not as sharply as in the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\u00a0  \"I mean, look, Senator Sanders, I think speaks to a lot of ideals that we all share,\" Buttigieg said at a Las Vegas town hall on Tuesday. \"But right now we've got to make sure we're drawing as many people as we can into our coalition.\"  Buttigieg also focused on Bloomberg at a CNN town hall and accused him of trying to buy the nomination.\u00a0  \"Look, my campaign wouldn't exist if all that mattered was how much money and fame you start with and how you get yourself on the air,\" Buttigieg said Tuesday night. \"We built this thing from, from nothing, and we built it by having those conversations and letting voters pick apart what you have to say, and to try to just go around that by throwing colossal sums of money on television shows you what's wrong with our system.\"  WHAT TO WATCH: Will Buttigieg criticize Bloomberg on spending millions of dollars in the presidential race? Can he make an effective appeal to minority voters?  AMY KLOBUCHAR  CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson:\u00a0With another $12 million in her campaign coffers since the last debate in New Hampshire, Klobuchar is still introducing herself to voters in Nevada. Rather than using her television ads to talk about specific issues in depth, she runs through her bio in an effort to raise her name ID in the state.\u00a0  As has been the case in previous debates, Klobuchar's team sees the debates as her greatest opportunity to make a positive impression \u2014 and earned media is free and has been very effective for her recently. Case in point, her third-place finish in New Hampshire, which her team credits to her highly lauded debate performance.  In previous debates, Klobuchar has taken every opportunity to jump in when two other candidates start to bicker, to state her belief that American voters are exhausted by the infighting. She uses these moments to pitch her plan \"to bridge the divides\" that separate Americans, boosting her message of success through passing bipartisan bills in the Senate. As her biggest rivals preview their attacks on Bloomberg in his debate debut tonight, it'll be interesting to see whether Klobuchar will insert herself to stop the \"noise\" or let the others fight it out with the former New York mayor.  And how will try to connect with minorities? This is currently a weak area of support for her campaign, which says that diverse voters throughout the country do not know her yet.  WHAT TO WATCH: How will she target her message to the almost 30% of Latinos, almost 10% of African-Americans and 8% of Asian-Americans in Nevada?  BERNIE SANDERS CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte:\u00a0 This debate feels like it could be the most consequential for Sanders to date. National polling has him ahead, putting him in his best position since Biden entered the race last summer. Sanders took New Hampshire and the popular vote in Iowa. Now, he's poised to perform well in Nevada and is rising in South Carolina.\u00a0 Then, there's Super Tuesday, where in California alone there are more delegates at play than twice the first four states combined. Sanders is leading there, too. Over the course of President's Day weekend, Sanders addressed some 50,000 supporters in Super Tuesday states. The 78-year-old democratic socialist is now the front-runner. Sanders has been fortified by his grassroots support of passionate followers and has benefited from the lack of a single moderate opponent. The heart attack he suffered in the fall does not appear to have affected his campaign, although the information the electorate has about his health remains incomplete, since the 78-year-old candidate has steadfastly refused to release his medical records. After his heart attack, Sanders emerged with an endorsement from progressive rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the largest fourth-quarter fundraising in the field.\u00a0 Critics have hammered Sanders' policies are too far left and say he'll alienate moderates. But given that there has been no single moderate to emerge from the pack, Sanders seems to have a solid path to winning the Democratic nomination, as an internal Bloomberg memo pointed out today. In response to the memo, Sanders' national campaign co-chair Sen. Nina Turner told CBS News, \"It's no surprise that Bloomberg and his team are sounding the alarm about the realities of the Sanders' campaign\u2014it is a multi-racial, multi-generational justice movement that can't be bought by the billionaire class. I'm glad he got the people's memo!\"  Sanders is very strong when he has a foil. For much of this race it has been \"the establishment,\" which Sanders defines on the stump as the media, Republicans, and even neoliberal, traditional Democrats. His supporters roar in support when he rails against \"the corporate elite\" and \"billionaire class\" that, in his words, are \"getting pretty nervous\" about his campaign's success.\u00a0 This bloc, according to Sanders and his supporters, is not only the biggest problem in American politics but his biggest obstacle to winning the nomination.  Bloomberg and others have said that Sanders' hasn't done enough to calm supporters and surrogates online, which can be projected into a larger critique in his ability to unite the party, should he win the nomination. At the same time, Sanders' platform is unmistakably pro-working class and anti-elite, something he will surely emphasize when debating Bloomberg.\u00a0  WHAT TO WATCH: How will these two foils play inside the debate hall? A candidate who rails against the type of privilege that got one opponent to the stage, or a candidate who has unlimited resources to deploy in the fight against President Trump.\u00a0  ELIZABETH WARREN  CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak:\u00a0Warren needs momentum, and the debate stage in Nevada may offer her a fleeting chance to regain it. In the last debate, Warren spoke less than any candidate who will be on the stage on Wednesday, except\u00a0Bloomberg, who did not debate in New Hampshire. And after coming in third place in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire, attention to Warren has been dwindling, with a national press corps that's now reduced to major outlets.\u00a0  But Warren will also be joined for the first time by the single Democratic candidate she's shown no hesitation to criticize, Bloomberg. Warren, whose campaign message is centered around getting money's taint out of politics, has gone so far as to suggest that the billionaire Bloomberg is running solely to try to avoid paying the wealth tax she's proposed.\u00a0  After Bloomberg made the debate, Warren tweeted that \"at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire.\" That said, Bloomberg has been a target for several of the candidates who will be on the stage, and Warren is likely to be drowned out if she doesn't find a way to get more speaking time.  Meanwhile, Warren has literally lost her voice over the past few days and has been recovering from a cold. In order to get some rest, Warren's events have been briefer than they typically are. But by the time she addressed a culinary union event in Las Vegas Tuesday night, she had mostly regained her voice.  WHAT TO WATCH: Will Warren be able to reenter the conversation when her anti-corruption platform is juxtaposed with Bloomberg's money-first campaign?  NEVADA  In a briefing with reporters late Tuesday, the Nevada State Democratic Party showcased a new \"caucus calculator\" Democrats hope will smooth tabulation and reporting for Nevada in the wake of Iowa Democrats' failure to report any of their caucus results on the night of their voting contest two weeks ago.\u00a0  However,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says\u00a0key questions remain unanswered about the party-run process here in the final days before the caucuses on Saturday, February 22. As first detailed by The Nevada Independent, the tool consists of a series of Google Forms and links to read-only previews of Google Sheets that assist caucus chairs in determining viability and realignment at each precinct.\u00a0  Accessed through links on iPads provided by the party, the tool is supposed to instantly combine volunteers' entries of in-person results at each precinct with early votes already tabulated by the state party, displaying them in spreadsheets accessed through the embedded 4G connections for each tablet.\u00a0  The state party has begun to train volunteers and campaigns on using the tool in person and through training slides\u00a0posted online by the state party. The iPads will be distributed through site leads in the coming days. The tool will not be able to interact with live results until Saturday, the day of the caucuses.\u00a0  Volunteers began practicing with the calculator Tuesday night, party officials said, with some 80 training sessions scheduled through the rest of the week. The party said that results from the four days of early voting are being scanned \"similar to a scantron,\" and the scans would be audited to ensure the results are being recorded accurately.\u00a0  Party officials on Wednesday said they were unaware of any errors in the automatic scanning process. CBS affiliate KLAS reported Tuesday that some ballots for early caucus voting had been invalidated, in\u00a0some cases because they were missing a signature. The party said Tuesday that 65 ballots had been invalidated because voters had not selected the minimum three candidates, as required for early voters. \u00a0  As a backup, officials said precinct chairs will be provided with a printed, anonymized list of ballots for their precincts summarizing the scanned preferences for each caucus-goer. Chairs will not have access that allows them to see original early votes or photocopies.  The state party said Wednesday that 70,000 Democrats had voted early in the state, suggesting turnout could be high on Saturday. In 2016, a total of 84,000 participated in the Nevada caucuses. Some campaigns reported delays in receiving early voting turnout data supplied through a data service called VAN, complaining that the service lagged publicly announced figures. Nevada Democratic Party officials declined to answer questions on this.\u00a0  Multiple campaign aides told CBS News they suspect the delay was due to a manual data entry step in tallying the early votes, when\u00a0preference cards\u00a0were attached to their home precincts. The party also denied reports of iPads crashing at the early vote sites, which some blamed for contributing to hours-long lines at locations throughout the state. \u00a0  The state party has chalked up the delays to unprecedented voter engagement and security checks. But volunteers said a shortage of volunteers, an inefficiently designed process, and poor information-sharing between sites also led to the frustrating wait times.\u00a0  And the party declined to answer most of the specific questions about the reporting process, a key factor in the Iowa results snafu. It did, however deny that the \"caucus calculator\" would play a role in reporting results, despite the fact that it appears to populate a spreadsheet in the state party's cloud with results from caucus sites. In fact, the reporting process is set up to be fairly low-tech.\u00a0  In memos released to the press and in caucus training sessions, chairs have been instructed to report results on the day of the caucuses by calling a \"reporting hotline\" with a secret passphrase and texting a photo of their documents to the state party.

            "article_content": "President Trump, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he'll release a plan for peace in the Middle East at noon on Tuesday. The indicted prime minister is meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House, followed by a White House visit from Netanyahu's political challenger, Benny Gantz, in the same day.\u00a0 It's unclear if the president has talked about the proposal with the Palestinians, obviously key stakeholders in any agreement with the Israelis. Asked if he's consulting with them or the Palestinian president, Mr. Trump said he'll be \"reporting on that tomorrow.\" The president emphasized that he wants the deal to work, but if it doesn't, said \"life goes on.\" Anticipating that the plan will favor Israel, the Palestinians have already indicated that they will not accept the plan. The Israeli meetings come as Mr. Trump's legal team prepares to defend him in the Senate impeachment trial, facing new allegations from former national security adviser John Bolton. Bolton, according to the New York Times, claims the president said he didn't want Ukraine aid released under investigations into the Bidens were produced. The president told reporters Monday he has not seen Bolton's manuscript, but labeled the allegations \" totally false.\"\u00a0 \"I haven't seen the manuscript, but I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton,\" the president told reporters Monday.\u00a0 Mr. Trump had also denied Bolton's claims on Twitter in a move that some suggested might undermine any future claims of executive privilege the president might make. In Davos, the president said he wanted to see Bolton testify, but had concerns about implications for national security.\u00a0 \"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,\" the president tweeted overnight. \"In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the...transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed, in addition to the fact that President Zelensky & the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems. Additionally, I met with President Zelensky at the United Nations...\" Netanyahu has been indicted on charges including bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Israel, and he's also facing his third re-election race in less than a year in March, after the first two proved inconclusive.",

            "article_content": "On election night, 2016, then-President Barack Obama called Donald Trump at about 3 a.m. to congratulate him,even though Mr. Trump had lost the popular vote and took the electoral college by less than 1% in three states. Today, President Trump declines to accept the verdict of the voters despite losing by greater margins to President-elect Joe Biden. Mr. Obama hasn't spoken of the election stand-off until today. We spoke to the 44th president on the release of his new book, \"A Promised Land,\" a memoir of his early years and first term. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: What is your advice in this moment for President Trump? Barack Obama: Well, a president is a public servant. They are temporary occupants of the office, by design. And when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments. My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it's time for you to do the same thing.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: In your view, it is time for him to concede? Barack Obama: Absolutely. Well, I mean, I think it was time for him to concede probably-- the day after the election-- or at the latest, two days after the election. When you look at the numbers objectively, Joe Biden will have won handily. There is no scenario in which any of those states would turn the other way, and certainly not enough to reverse the outcome of the election. More than the courtesy of a concession, the Trump White House is declining to free up the usual funds and facilities for the incoming administration. President-elect Biden is not receiving secret national security briefings as Mr. Trump did when he was president-elect. Scott Pelley: What in your estimation would our adversaries be thinking right now, Russia, China, about the fact that the transition is not moving forward? Barack Obama: Well, I-- look, I think our adversaries have seen us weakened, not just as a consequence of this election, but over the last several years. We have these cleavages in the body politic that they're convinced they can exploit. There's an old adage that partisan politics should stop at the water's edge, right? That, when it comes to our foreign policy, that it is the United States of America, not the divided states of America.\u00a0 We met the former president at a symbol of America's past divisions. The Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery was a hospital in the Civil War. Clara Barton and Walt Whitman cared for patients in the building where the 16th president consoled his wounded. We joined Mr. Obama's peers in the gallery of the presidents to talk about his book. Scott Pelley: I'm curious about the title. I think a lot of people feel that we are farther from a promised land. Barack Obama: Well, I titled it \"The Promised Land\" because even though we may not get there in our lifetimes, even if we experience hardships and disappointments along the way, that I at least still have faith we can create a more perfect union. Not a perfect union, but a more perfect union. Scott Pelley: You write in the book, \"Our democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of a crisis.\" What do you mean? Barack Obama: We have gone through a presidency that disregarded a whole host of basic institutional norms, expectations we had for a president that had been observed by Republicans and Democrats previously. And maybe most importantly, and most disconcertingly, what we've seen is what some people call truth decay, something that's been accelerated by outgoing President Trump, the sense that not only do we not have to tell the truth, but the truth doesn't even matter. Scott Pelley: What are these false claims of widespread election fraud doing to our country right now? Barack Obama: The president doesn't like to lose and-- never admits loss. I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that's a dangerous path. We would never accept that out of our own kids behaving that way if they lost, right? I mean, if my daughters, in any kinda competition, pouted and-- and then accused the other side of cheating when they lost, when there was no evidence of it, we'd scold 'em. I think that there has been this sense over the last several years that literally anything goes and is justified in order to get power. And that's not unique to the United States. There are strong men and dictators around the world who think that, \"I can do anything to stay in power. I can kill people. I can throw them in jail. I can run phony elections. I can suppress journalists.\" But that's not who we're supposed to be. And one of the signals I think that Joe Biden needs to send to the world is that, \"No, those values that we preached, and we believed in, and subscribed in-- we still believe.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: President-elect Biden won in this election more votes than anyone in history. And yet, the 2020 vote wasn't a repudiation of Donald Trump; it was more like an affirmation. He received 71 million votes, 8 million more than he did in 2016. What does that tell you about our country today? Barack Obama: Well, A. it tells us that we're very divided. And as I said, it's not just the politicians now. The voters are divided. It has now become a contest where issues, facts, policies per se don't matter as much as identity and wanting to beat the other guy. You know, that's taken priority. I do think the current media environment adds to that greatly. This democracy doesn't work if we don't have an informed citizenry. This democracy doesn't work if we don't have responsible elected officials at other levels who are willing to call the president when he's not doing something right, call him on it. Scott Pelley: It seems, though, Mr. President, that Americans have gone from disagreeing with one another to hating one another, a problem that this man had. (Pointing to portrait of Abraham Lincoln) Barack Obama: He's a good example of somebody who I think understood deeply the need to be able to see another person's point of view. Scott Pelley: How do we overcome where we are today? Barack Obama: There's no American figure that I admire any more than Abraham Lincoln. But he did end up-- with a civil war on his hands. I think we'd like to avoid that. I do think that a new president can set a new tone. That's not gonna solve all the gridlock in Washington. I think we're gonna have to work with the media and with the tech companies to find ways to inform the public better about the issues and to-- bolster the standards that ensure we can separate truth from fiction. I think that we have to work at a local level. When you start getting to the local level, mayors-- county commissioners, et cetera, they've actually gotta make real decisions. It's not abstractions. It's like, \"We need to fix this road. We need to get this snow plowed. We need to make sure our kids have a safe playground to-- to-- to play in.\" And at that level, I don't think people have that kind of-- visceral hatred. And that's where we have to start in terms of rebuilding the social trust we need for democracy to work. Mr. Obama is speaking after four years of virtual silence on Donald Trump. He followed a traditional commandment largely observed since adams succeeded washington \u2013thou shall not criticize your successor. In \"A Promised Land\" he wonders if that was a mistake. Scott Pelley: In your book, you ask, quote, \"Whether I was too tempered in speaking the truth, too cautious in word or deed.\" Many Americans, Mr. President, believe you were too cautious, too tempered. Barack Obama: Yeah. And-- and-- and I think that' a legitimate and understandable criticism. At the end of the day, I consistently tried to treat my political opposition in the ways I'd want to be treated, To not overreact when, for example, somebody yells, \"You lie,\" in the middle of me giving a joint congressional address.\u00a0 Barack Obama: I understand why there were times where my supporters wanted me to be more pugilistic, to, you know, pop folks in the head and duke it out a little bit more. Scott Pelley: Was it a mistake that you didn't? Barack Obama: Every president brings a certain temperament to office. I think part of the reason I got elected was because I sent a message that fundamentally I believe the American people are good and decent, and that politics doesn't have to be some cage match in-- in which everybody is-- is going at each other's throats and that we can agree without being disagreeable. There have been worse presidential transitions than 2020. The southern states seceded while Lincoln was president-elect. Still, we couldn't help but notice, outside the national portrait gallery, businesses are still boarded up against the fear of political violence.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: What should President Trump do on this next inauguration day? Barack Obama: Look there are a set of traditions that we have followed in the peaceful transfer of power. The outgoing president congratulates the incoming president, instructs the government and the agencies to cooperate with the new government coming in. You invite the president-elect to the Oval Office And then on inauguration day, the president invites the president-elect to the White House and there's a small reception. And then you drive to the inauguration site, and the outgoing president sits there and is part of the audience as the new president is sworn in. And at that point, the outgoing president is a citizen like everybody else and owes the new president the chance to do their best on behalf of the American people. Whether Donald Trump will do the same thing we'll have to see. So far, that's not been his approach. But you know hope springs eternal. There's a promised land out there somewhere. Two hours after Mr. Obama said that, President Trump tweeted from the White House, \"We will win\" even though no state is reporting fraud or errors that could change the outcome. During Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009, unknown to the public, there was intelligence that a terrorist attack was planned. President Obama had, at the podium, instructions he would read to the crowd should there be an evacuation of nearly 2 million people from the National Mall. This is one of the insights in Mr. Obama's new book, \"A Promised Land,\" a memoir of his early years, his historic election, and his first term. We spoke to the 44th president about battles past and present. Scott Pelley: Did you watch the video of George Floyd's strangulation? Barack Obama: Of course. It was heartbreaking. Very rarely, though, did you see it so viscerally and over a stretch of time where the humanity of the victim is so apparent, the pain and the vulnerability of someone so clear. And it was, I think, a moment in which America for a brief moment came face to face with a reality that African Americans in this country I think had understood for quite some time. And I was heartened and inspired by the galvanizing effect that it had on the country as a whole. The fact that it wasn't just Black people. It wasn't just some, quote/unquote, \"liberals\" who were appalled by it, reacted to it, and eventually marched. But it was everybody. And it was a small first step in the kind of reckoning with our past and our present that so often we avoid.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: But Mr. President, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, why is this injustice never overcome? Barack Obama: Well, it, for a couple of reasons. One is that we have a criminal justice system in which we ask oftentimes very young, oftentimes not-very-well-trained officers to go into communities and just keep a lid on things. And, you know, we don't try to get at some of the underlying causes for chronic poverty. So if we're going to actually solve this problem, there are some specific things we can do to make sure that our contracts with police officers don't completely insulate them when they do something wrong, putting money into budgets for training these police officers more effectively, teaching police officers not to escalate but to de-escalate. But it's important for us not to let ourselves off the hook and think this is just a police problem, because those shootings, that devaluation of life is part and parcel with a legacy of discrimination, and Jim Crow, and segregation that we're all responsible for. And if we're gonna actually put an end to racial bias in the criminal justice system, then we're gonna have to work on doing something about racial bias in corporate America and bias in where people can buy homes. And that is a larger project in which all of the good news is all of us can take some responsibility. We-- we can all do better on this front than we've been doing. We joined the president this past Wednesday behind masks and then kept our distance as the U.S. counted 143,000 known COVID infections that day, a new record. Mr. Obama had also faced an outbreak in his first term\u2014a new flu, H1N1. Barack Obama: I was terrified of it and very quickly mobilized a team to figure out, \"How are we gonna take the best possible approach?\" And from the start, I had some very clear criteria which it was, number one, we're gonna follow the science. And the second thing was, \"Let's make sure we're providing good information to the American people.\" But H1N1, was not as contagious nor as lethal as COVID. It ultimately killed 12,000 Americans. Other battles in his book include the financial crisis, passing the affordable care act, the decision to kill Osama bin Laden and leaving eight years of work in the hands of another.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: You begin the book by writing about the day that you left Washington, quote, \"to someone diametrically opposed to everything we stood for.\" Barack Obama: That may be the one thing that Donald Trump and I agree on, is that he doesn't agree with me on anything. I don't see him as the cause for our divisions and the problems with our government. I think he's an accelerant, but they preceded him. and sadly are gonna likely outlast him. Scott Pelley: You write in the book that Republicans had a battle plan to, quote, \"Refuse to work with me, regardless of the circumstances, the issue, or the consequences for the country.\" Now, the same might be said of Democrats in a Republican administration. I wonder if today you think that Democrats and Republicans are no longer capable of compromise. Barack Obama: First of all, I don't think this is just a plague on both their houses here. So, the Democrats opposed George Bush on a whole buncha stuff. But Ted Kennedy worked with George Bush to pass a prescription drug plan for seniors. Nancy Pelosi, who adamantly opposed the war in Iraq, time and again voted, even when her base was angry about it, to make sure that our troops were funded once the decision to send in troops to Iraq went in.\u00a0 Mr. Obama blames gridlock on something old and something new, the Senate's filibuster tradition which allows whatever party is in the minority to block legislation and nontraditional media. Barack Obama: The media landscape has changed. And as a consequence, voters' perceptions have changed. So that I think Democratic and Republican voters have become much more partisan. I would often hear this from Republicans during my presidency, some of these folks have been colleagues of mine. I served in the Senate. Some of them were friends of mine. And they would confess to me and said, \"Look, Mr. President, I know you're right. But if I vote with you on this, I'm gonna get killed. I'll lose my seat.\" Because what had happened is their voter base had soaked in so much information that was demonizing me, demonizing the Affordable Care Act, that it becomes very difficult, even for folks who want to cooperate, to cooperate. And that's why I am somebody who does not blame the current partisanship solely on Donald Trump or solely on social media. You already saw some of these trends taking place early in my presidency. But I do think they've kept on getting worse. The former president also writes about his unlikely rise\u2014including the obstacles at home. Scott Pelley: You're surprisingly honest in the book about your wife's opposition to you running for president in 2008. You quote her as saying, \"The answer is no. I do not want you running for president. God, Barack, when is it going to be enough?\" Did I get the tone right? Barack Obama: It was a little sharper than that, but it was pretty good, Scott. Scott Pelley: And then she walks out of the room. Why did that not stop you? Barack Obama: Look, it's a legitimate question. Keep in mind the context here. We had-- just two years earlier, I'd run for the U.S. Senate in an unlikely race. Two years before that, I had run for Congress.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: In a race you lost. Barack Obama: In a race I lost. A couple years before that, I had run for the state senate. We'd got two young kids. Michelle's still working. And I ask myself in the book, you know, \"How much of this is just megalomania? How much of this is vanity? How much of this is me trying to-- prove something to myself?\" And over time she made a conclusion that, \"I shouldn't stand in the way of this.\" She then-- Scott Pelley: That she should not stand in the way of your ambitions-- Barack Obama: Yeah. Scott Pelley: --to be president? Barack Obama: Yeah. And-- and-- and she did so grudgingly. And the fact that I ended up winning didn't necessarily alleviate her frustration because the toll it takes on families is real.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: I think it's only after you emerge from an all-consuming job that you realize that everything you hold dear is thanks to the one you love. Barack Obama: I think I actually realized that even while I was in the job. The fact that she put up with it and forgave me is\u2014was an act of grace that I am grateful for and I'm not sure I deserved it Today, at the age of 59, Mr. Obama is working on his presidential center. Barack Obama: So this is gonna be on the South Side of Chicago in historic Jackson Park. And it's the place where Michelle and I met, where I first started in public life. His team brought this model to show us. Mr. Obama's foundation has raised, from private donations, a little over half the estimated 500 million dollar cost. It will take about four years once they start. Barack Obama: It's gonna be a place where, you know, we have the standard model Oval Office, and Michelle's dresses, which will be very popular no doubt. But also, you know, a whole host of facilities that allow us to provide classroom training to young people who are interested in public service, and to beautify a park that can serve a whole bunch of young people who've been underserved in the past. In his last moments in the Oval Office Mr. Obama left a note in the president's desk for his successor. It read, in part, \"We are just temporary occupants of this office... It's up to us to leave the... instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.\" Barack Obama: On that last day-- the emotions really focus on the team that you've been working on. And it's very rare outside of maybe wartime where you get a collection of people working together in a sustained way under that kind of pressure and stress. And so there's a melancholy to it. There was also though, and I write about this, a satisfaction in knowing that I had finished the job, I had run my stretch of the race.\u00a0 And I could say unequivocally, despite regrets and disappointments about some things not getting done-- the country was better off when I left than when I got there.\u00a0 Produced by Maria Gavrilovic.

            "article_content": "As protests continue across the country,\u00a0new CBS News polling\u00a0finds 58% of Americans disapprove of President Trump's handling of race relations, while 33% approve.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0Eleanor Watson\u00a0report the polling breaks down further along party lines with 72% of Republicans approving while 92% of Democrats disapprove. African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the president's overall job performance and his handling of race relations.\u00a0 At the same time, more Americans are now saying racial discrimination impacts both treatment by police and chances of getting ahead. Eight in 10 Americans feel discrimination against African-Americans exists today, including half who say there is a lot of discrimination and 31% who say there is some. CBS News polling also found 52% believe white people have a better chance of getting ahead, up from 39% in polling conducted in 2015. At the same time, 57% of Americans now believe police are more likely to use deadly force against a black person.\u00a0 A majority of both white and black people believe race relations in the U.S. are generally bad, with just 17% saying they're getting better. Forty-two percent say they're getting worse, while 39% say they're staying the same. According to previous CBS News polling, more Americans believe the state of race relations is more negative than it was a year ago.\u00a0 More Americans now believe there is more racial discrimination by police than they did in 2016. Four years ago in 2016, 43% of Americans said police are more likely to use deadly force against a black person, and Wednesday's poll shows 57% of Americans now say there is discrimination.\u00a0 In response to the death of George Floyd, a majority of Republicans like most Democrats and independents do not think the force used by the Minneapolis police officer was justified. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden is connecting President Trump's response to the ongoing protests of American police brutality to the protests at Tiananmen Square 31 years ago today in China,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 Those pro-democracy protests against the communist Chinese government in 1989 were also led by young people and Biden is pointing to Mr. Trump's remarks decades ago calling those protests a \"riot\" and commending China for showing \"the power of strength.\" Biden is drawing a parallel with the ongoing police brutality protests in the U.S., characterizing the president's response as the \"language of authoritarians\" in an effort \"to sow hate and division.\" Biden is also trying to foil a common attack line from the president who often accuses Biden of being too soft on China.\u00a0 Later today, Biden is expected to hold a virtual town hall with actor Don Cheadle and young Americans. Local Delaware leaders told Biden earlier this week he needs to do a better job at hearing directly from young people during this time and it appears he is taking their advice. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP Beginning next week, organizers for the Trump campaign will hit the pavement again, resuming in-person organizing for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports Trump Victory \u2013 the joint campaign operation between the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee will \"flip the switch\" on campaign field organizing throughout June, returning to door-knocking and in-person voter registration in reopening states.\u00a0 \"Just as Trump Victory was able to transition to virtual campaigning in less than 24 hours, our teams across the country will seamlessly adapt again just as efficiently,\" RNC National Press Secretary Mandi Merritt told CBS News.\u00a0 GOP volunteers and staff members will adhere to local health and safety guidelines, abiding by capacity limits and exercising social distancing, an RNC official tells CBS News. Though no concrete plans have been made, the campaign hopes to host office openings featuring campaign surrogates, including Donald Trump Jr. in future months.\u00a0 President Trump will headline in-person, private fundraisers next week in Texas and New Jersey limited to about 25 people each. According to a senior campaign official, Trump campaign staff have returned to the Trump headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, this week. While not all staff have returned full time, multiple senior campaign officials have been operating out of the campaign's Virginia locale for nearly a week. Campaign officials tell CBS News they are \"taking appropriate precautions\" when it comes to social distancing and sanitation. President Trump met with his senior campaign advisers Thursday to discuss internal polling and campaign strategy, in a series of meetings spanning well over an hour, according to senior officials in attendance.\u00a0Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0White House producer Fin Gomez\u00a0report the president requested the meetings this past weekend, as demonstrations spread through the nation in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minnesota. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien, the president's polling team, chief of staff Mark Meadows and senior White House officials sat down with the president in the Oval Office to pore over recent poll numbers.\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence did not attend, but poked his head into a wide-ranging discussion with senior communications officials and surrogates that followed in the Cabinet Room. The president appeared in \"high spirits\" according to those in attendance. He asked multiple questions about his campaign surrogates. He wanted to know, namely, who's out carrying the campaign's message on his behalf as he responds to three crises from inside the West Wing.\u00a0 The president talked at length with campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson and RNC senior communications adviser of black media affairs Paris Dennard about the campaign's efforts to \"attract black voters.\" Pierson told the president there was a four-figure uptick in engagement with black voters following Joe Biden's \"You Ain't Black\" comment on \"The Breakfast Club\" radio show.\u00a0 Trump allies tell CBS News the president has expressed interest and concern over recent poll numbers in battleground states. According to a senior campaign official, as he left today's meetings, the president turned back to deliver a final message to attendees five months out from the election: \"We're going to win.\" LIFE AFTER 2020 CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Cory Booker commented on the latest charges against the Minneapolis officers involved in the death of George Floyd in an interview with the Washington Post Thursday. Booker said, \"I think the up charges are very, very good things and give some sign of hope that there will be justice done in a country which has under-prosecuted police officers who have done wrong.\"\u00a0 Asked if Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley should resign following the response to peaceful protesters outside of the White House,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports Booker said, \"I think that there is just a complicity with, with things that \u2013 where people are showing a loyalty to party over, over loyalty to country.\"\u00a0 Booker also talked about the conversations that he had with family members about how to protect himself growing up as a black man in America.\u00a0 \"The conversations I had with my parents and other elders in my family \u2013 and that's not unique to me \u2013 this is an experience that so many African-American men were taught at a very early age to be afraid, to take measures to protect yourself,\" Booker said. \"That just jogging in your neighborhood, reaching for a cell phone, shopping in a mall, all of these things can end up entangling your life.\" CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES TEXAS TRADE SCHOOL STUDENTS \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Today we take a look at how\u00a0trade school students\u00a0on Texas have been affected by the virus \u2013 like\u00a0Cindy Trejo, 36, a medical assistant, who has been able to use her vocational training on the front lines fighting COVID-19, even as her family has been devastated by the virus. Others, like Kia McGuire, a single mother raising three children, had been attending Barbers Inc. Trade School in Beaumont, Texas until her schooling was put on hold for safety precautions. With her schooling delayed,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says McGuire now has to wait out the pandemic to see if the job she had lined up pre-COVID19 will still be waiting for her.\u00a0 ISSUES THAT MATTER JOBS Nearly 1.9 million American workers filed for unemployment benefits last week and another 623,000 filed for benefits under a federal program covering self-employed and gig workers, the Labor Department reported on Thursday says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 While the number of initial jobless claims is still far greater than any weekly number prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been steadily declining for the last nine weeks. More than 42 million Americans have filed traditional unemployment benefits since the pandemic forced businesses to close in mid-March, but some of those people have returned to work.\u00a0 About 21.5 million Americans were still collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, for the week ending May 23, according to the Labor Department. But an analysis from the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute\u00a0finds that looking at all unemployment programs, 37.2 million people are either receiving benefits or have applied for benefits and waiting to hear if they will receive them. That's nearly a quarter of the American workforce.\u00a0 On Friday, the government is expected to report 8 million jobs lost in May, on top of 20 million lost in April. Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projected\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic could shrink the economy by $8 trillion over the next decade. VOTE-BY-MAIL The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the California Democratic Party moved on Wednesday to intervene in two lawsuits from Republicans that would block the state from implementing vote-by-mail initiatives, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar.\u00a0 Last month the National Republican Congressional Committee, the California Republican Party, and the Republican National Committee joined forces in a\u00a0lawsuit against California Governor Gavin Newsom. The GOP-led lawsuit aims to reverse Newsom's executive order to automatically send every registered voter a ballot ahead of the November presidential election.\u00a0 Republicans claim Newsom's order is a power grab and automatically sending registered voters in the state a ballot will lead to increased fraudulent activities. The DCCC and the CA Democratic Party argue that the state's \"decision to implement a primarily all-mail system for the election is not only reasonable, but constitutionally required to ensure all eligible California voters\" can participate in the election safely.\u00a0 The Democrats motion to join Newsom as defendants in the lawsuit was granted Wednesday. \u00a0According to\u00a0a recent survey\u00a0from the California Public Policy Institute, an overwhelming majority of likely California voters (73%) say sending vote-by-mail ballots for the November election to all registered voters is a good idea, while just 24% say it is a bad idea. Among likely Democratic voters in California, 94% support expanding vote-by-mail compared to 63% of independents and just 37% of Republicans who think it is a good idea. Separately, a new\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0finds that most Americans say their family has been financially affected in some way by the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdowns, according to\u00a0CBS News Election & Survey Unit's Fred Backus\u00a0and\u00a0Jennifer De Pinto.\u00a0 Almost one in five Americans describe the impact as a hardship. Larger numbers describe it as inconvenient or difficult but would not go so far as to call it a hardship. Most Americans, however, remain optimistic that jobs will come back.\u00a0 Americans with lower incomes are more likely to feel the effects. A quarter of Americans earning less than $50,000 a year say the financial impact has been a hardship, compared to just 11% of Americans earning $100,000 a year or more. Americans who say the impact is a hardship report having a harder time meeting their bills and obligations:\u00a0 nearly half (45%) say they are not making enough to do so.\u00a0 Most Americans overall think the economic impact of the coronavirus will be felt equally by white communities and communities of color, though 31% think it will impact communities of color more. Blacks are more likely than whites to say it will impact communities of color more.\u00a0 There are partisan differences as well. Fifty-two percent of Democrats think communities of color will be impacted the most. Most Republicans (86%) and independents (68%) think both communities will be impacted equally.\u00a0 Most report no change in optimism when they compare themselves now to before the pandemic. However, Americans with lowest incomes do tend to be more pessimistic than those who earn more. And six in 10 expect jobs in their communities that have been lost during the coronavirus outbreak to come back as the economy improves. Americans of all income levels, in all regions of the country, and in the cities, suburbs, and rural areas alike all have confidence that jobs will return. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE CALIFORNIA Recent Facebook posts by a woman paid by Mike Garcia's campaign, in California's 25th District, show inflammatory comments about the nationwide protests over police brutality. In one of the\u00a0posts, she shared a meme of President Obama that reads, \"How do you know when the virus isn't working anymore? They shift to a racial war.\"\u00a0 The woman, Victoria Redstall, was previously paid $870 by the Garcia campaign for photography and web services. She's also been seen\u00a0introducing Garcia\u00a0at campaign events and conducted an\u00a0interview\u00a0with him in February before his\u00a0March 3\u00a0primary. \u00a0 \"Why aren't these bastards being shot with rubber bullets (or worse)?\u00a0 These aren't protests. - This is Anarchy! Leave our Heroes/Law Enforcement alone,\"\u00a0another post\u00a0reads. In\u00a0one post, she shares an article about protests coming to the Santa Clarita area and says, \"These bastards are now coming to our town...watch out we have a lot more cops here than these scumbags now.\"\u00a0 Garcia's campaign spokesperson Lance Trover told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0Redstall had a brief contract and does not work for the campaign.\u00a0 \"Congressman Garcia vehemently disagrees with Ms. Redstall's comments, and as a first generation American who served our country finds them disgusting and believes they have no place in our dialogue. Once he learned of those he immediately asked they be taken down,\" Trover said.\u00a0 Garcia appeared on a Trump campaign livestream event\u00a0Tuesday night\u00a0and said, \"The reaction that we're seeing in terms of the violence and the looting is not the right answer...Lawful, legal protests are a good thing\u2026Unfortunately, it's taken a turn for a lot more violence in some cases and looting. We are a country of law and order.\"\u00a0 NEW JERSEY In New Jersey's 2nd District, Democratic candidate Amy Kennedy is still dealing with a super PAC, funded by $500,000 from her husband Patrick Kennedy, that spent money to attack her opponent Brigid Callahan Harrison. Patrick Kennedy, a former Rhode Island Congressman, defended his funding of the super PAC to the\u00a0New Jersey Globe, saying that it is needed to combat the \"machine\" in South Jersey \"that doesn't give anyone else a fair shot, but Amy does have a shot because her last name is Kennedy.\"\u00a0 He added that he wishes people \"were half as concerned about where\" Harrison gets her money, and said \"my wife may be beholden to me,\" but that Harrison is \"beholden\" to George Norcross, a businessman that helped fuel Jeff Van Drew's Congressional run as a Democrat. Amy Kennedy has asked the\u00a0Blue Organizing Project\u00a0super PAC, which has spent $75,000 for anti-Harrison ads and $40,000 in polling, to refrain from spending in this race.\u00a0 \"It's great to have a husband who is so passionate about helping me and I am grateful for his unwavering support and encouragement during this campaign,\" she told\u00a0Navarro.\u00a0\"But, what everyone who knows me knows is that, unlike Van Drew, who pledged his undying support to Donald Trump and has spent more time raising money for him than helping the people of South Jersey during this crisis, I will never be beholden to anyone other than the people of South Jersey. \" NEW YORK Nearby in New York, progressive challenger Jamaal Bowman was endorsed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez late Wednesday night. Bowman is looking to unseat Congressman Elliot Engel, a 30-year incumbent that is currently the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Ocasio-Cortez unseated an established Democrat in her 2018 primary win over Joe Crowley, partly by painting her incumbent as absent in the district, a central message in Bowman's campaign.\u00a0 The campaign says it has been able to raise $204,000 in the\u00a0past two days\u00a0and will report $427,000 overall in this last pre-primary fundraising period.\u00a0 \"Eliot Engel's biggest advantage is money, and the fact that we're now competitive with a 31-year incumbent when it comes to fundraising shows just how much trouble he is in,\" Hayes said.\u00a0 Engel's campaign recently said they would not seek an endorsement from The New York Times, due to an op-ed published by Senator Tom Cotton about using the military against protestors.\u00a0 \"No real progressive leader can morally accept the paper's endorsement,\" Engel said in a statement. \"We must stand with those protesting the paper's policy, and reject their consideration until this and all similar columns are struck from the Times archives and an apology is issued by the editorial board and publisher.\" IN THE SENATE Democratic Senate candidate John Hickenlooper did not appear at a virtual ethics hearing Thursday even after a district judge ruled late Wednesday that he cannot block a subpoena to testify, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 Hickenlooper has been called to testify before the Independent Ethics Commission in Colorado about private flights he took while he was governor. The Public Trust Institute, a conservative group, has accused Hickenlooper of violating ethics laws by taking these flights.\u00a0 Hickenlooper has called for in-person hearings in August so he can face his accusers. His team filed an appeal before the virtual hearing's scheduled start time, but the hearing went forward without Hickenlooper present. According to a spokesperson for the commission, the hearing was continued to tomorrow, after finding Hickenlooper in contempt. \u00a0 The Commission indicated it may discuss sanctions tomorrow for the failure to appear.\u00a0 There is also a separate action, filed by the Commission and pending in the district court, to enforce the Commission's subpoena.\u00a0 \"John Hickenlooper has made clear he will testify in person. Today's debacle of a hearing has made clear that WebEx doesn't work for a legal proceeding like this,\" said Melissa Miller, a spokeswoman for Hickenlooper, referring to the video conferencing program. \"We will be opposing the motion to enforce the subpoena.\"",

            "article_content": "Fifty-seven years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s\u00a0\"I Have a Dream\" speech\u00a0at the March on Washington, the families of Black Americans shot or killed by police officers spoke at the same site Friday, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. The families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner and Jacob Blake joined Reverend Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III at the\u00a0Commitment March: Get Your Knee off Our Necks, which drew an estimated thousands.\u00a0 The march, organized by the National Action Network, was calling for racial justice and police reform. Sharpton first announced plans for the march during a\u00a0memorial service\u00a0for\u00a0George Floyd, the 46-year-old father who died at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May. \"George Floyd's story has been the story of Black folks because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed to be is you kept your knee on our neck,\" Sharpton said at the service in June. \"It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say, 'Get your knee off our necks!'\" George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told the crowd Friday he was overwhelmed by the support, and said he wished \"George were here to see this right now.\" His sister, Bridgett Floyd, said, \"we have to be the change.\" The mothers of\u00a0Dontre Hamilton,\u00a0Trayvon Martin\u00a0and\u00a0Ahmaud Arbery\u00a0also spoke.\u00a0 \"Even though we're going through a crisis, even though it looks dark, I want to tell you to be encouraged,\" said Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton. \"Don't stop saying Black lives matter, don't stop protesting,\" she said.\u00a0 In the months since Floyd's death,\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u00a0marches have proliferated across the country. Protesters continue to call for justice for the\u00a0officers charged\u00a0in Floyd's death, and those involved in other controversial cases including the death of\u00a0Breonna Taylor,\u00a0who was shot and killed by officers in her own home in Louisville, and\u00a0Elijah McClain, who died after a police chokehold in Aurora, Colorado, last summer. Protests erupted again this week following the shooting of\u00a0Jacob Blake\u00a0in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was hospitalized after police shot him several times in the back as he opened the door of his parked car. Attorneys for his family say he is\u00a0now paralyzed. Jacob Blake's father speaks at the March on Washington: \"I'm tired of looking at cameras and seeing these young black and brown people suffer\u2026 We are not taking it anymore\" https://t.co/rPUAWLIwhM pic.twitter.com/wW7FGvc2yM Blake's father spoke at the march on Friday, and used it as an opportunity to \"hold court\" against systematic racism in America. \"We're going to have court right now. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Racism against all of us. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty,\" he said. \"\u2026 And we're not taking it anymore.\" \"We're going to stand up, every Black person in the United States is going to stand up,\" he said. \"We're tired. I'm tired of looking at cameras and seeing these young Black and Brown people suffer.\" His words, spoken on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, come 57 years after his own father attended the original March on Washington, according to Blake. \"I have a duty,\" he said. \"I have a duty to support and understand each one \u2014 I love everybody in this crowd, I love you.\" Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris recorded brief remarks for the march that played during the event on Friday. Harris, who tweeted her address Thursday night, said that if civil rights activists from the 1960s were here today, they \"would share in our anger and frustration as we continue to see Black men and women slain in our streets and left behind by an economy and justice system that have too often denied Black folks our dignity and rights.\"\u00a0 \"They would share our anger and pain, but no doubt they would turn it into fuel,\" Harris continued. \"They would be lacing up their shoes, locking arms and continuing right alongside us to continue in this ongoing fight for justice.\" Harris said Americans are once again in a position to make history. \"The road ahead is not going to be easy,\" she said, adding, \"we have an opportunity to make history, right here and right now.\" Other lawmakers spoke about the need to pass legislation crafted to confront racial injustice. Texas Congressman Sheila Jackson Lee asked the crowd, \"how did this happen?\" answering, \"because of institutional racism.\" Lee urged for the passage of her bill H.R. 40, which would establish a commission to \"study and develop reparation proposals for African-Americans.\" Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, demanded that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 be fully restored. The act established federal oversight of election laws in states with a history of racial discrimination, but key sections of the legislation were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. The late\u00a0Congressman John Lewis\u00a0spent much of his life fighting for voting rights and was a champion of the act, which passed in part because of his march in Selma, Alabama. Lewis continued to fight for its restoration until his death in July.\u00a0 \"We are here today because people died, and were denied basic civil rights,\" Beatty said. \"... John Lewis left us with marching orders.\" Reverend Al Sharpton also invoked Lewis in his speech. With a nod to his advocacy of getting into \"good trouble,\" Sharpton said, \"we didn't come to start trouble, we came to stop trouble.\" \"Black lives matter,\" Sharpton said. \"And we won't stop until it matters to everybody.\"  Tim Perry contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When Michigan and Pennsylvania certified their election results this week, they proved that our democratic processes are resilient, capable of withstanding the onslaught of lawsuits and other measures by President Trump and his legal team to toss out votes.\u00a0 But voting rights advocates and activists still worry that even if the president's efforts to undermine the vote in predominantly Black communities didn't succeed, they could still have a negative long-term impact. \u00a0 The Trump team's questioning of the legitimacy of the votes in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Atlanta without presenting any evidence in court of large-scale illegal voting \"really is a dangerous and racialized narrative about voter fraud,\" says Monique Lin-Luse, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which filed a lawsuit against the Trump campaign on behalf of Black voters in Michigan.\u00a0 The message those efforts send is that \"the will of those voters are not to be seen as legitimate; their political will as expressed at the ballot box doesn't have the same weight,\" said Lin-Luse. \"It's antithetical to a functioning democracy where every vote is supposed to count.\" The suit filed by the LDF last week argues that the efforts made by the Trump legal team to pressure local officials not to certify the election results violated provisions in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlaws voter intimidation, threats, and coercion. The president called a Republican member of the Wayne County canvassing board who initially refused to certify the results before ultimately approving them, and then tried to rescind her approval. \"It changes the result of the election in Michigan, if you take out Wayne County,\" Trump campaign lawyer Rudy Guiliani said at a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also invited Republican leaders in the Michigan State Legislature to the White House in a move seen as a possible attempt to interfere with the way in which the state awards electors. But upon the certification of the results by the Michigan State Canvassing Board on Monday, state House Speaker Lee Chatfield, who met with the president, said the legislature \"will uphold the law and respect this result.\" Unverified claims by the Trump team of voter fraud were dismissed by courts. In Pennsylvania, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann excoriated the president's case, which he said offered \"strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.\" He continued, \"In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state.\"\u00a0 It's clear that the systems and infrastructure for the election worked as they should have, too. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\u00a0called the 2020 election \"the most secure in American history.\" (Within days of that statement, Christopher Krebs, the head of the agency, was fired by Mr. Trump, who called his statement \"highly inaccurate.\") While legal and election systems ultimately protected the votes, the continued disparagement of the process by the president could still have an impact on some voters.\u00a0 Election experts and voting rights advocates think the efforts of the president and his campaign to alter the election results shouldn't go unpunished.\u00a0 \"It's not about whether they are successful in overturning the election,\" says Lin-Luse. \"It's important to establish the guardrails on our democracy on our elections.\" \u00a0 \"It would be hard to tell minority voters, particularly African Americans in urban areas who have seen this happen before, who have heard the rhetoric, that they shouldn't be concerned. They should be concerned,\" says David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research and a CBS News contributor.\u00a0 Becker notes that Trump actually improved his numbers in Philadelphia and Detroit in 2020 compared to 2016. Of Pennsylvania and Michigan, he said Mr. Trump \"didn't lose those states because of Black voters in Philadelphia and Detroit...he lost those states because of suburban voters.\" \"Without a racial element to the targeting, it's hard to see how the facts support targeting those areas,\" Becker added. \"It was like, going back in time. I mean, it was literally a scenario where we were watching elected officials argue about whether our votes should count or not,\" said Rev. Charles Williams, pastor of King Solomon Baptist Church in Detroit and president of the Michigan Chapter of National Action Network. \"This is no different than having to count how many pieces of candy that are in the jar before I can vote.\" \u00a0 Heading into the election, a CBS News/BET poll found that Black voters, especially younger voters, were concerned that their vote wouldn't be counted properly. A majority said they worried about intimidation at the polls.\u00a0 Williams says the efforts to undermine the results threatens to worsen underlying fears and could have a lingering impact beyond this election.\u00a0 \"Every election in the Black community, we have to prime and coerce and engage people in such a way that we let them know that their votes [count],\" said Williams. \"There's a high bit of skepticism out there from folks who don't believe that the process is fair. Not that the process is rigged, not that anybody's trying to cheat. But that the process is fair. And it's unfair that cities like Detroit, cities like Milwaukee, cities, like Philadelphia, cities like Atlanta..have to be targeted in such a way where our votes could possibly be thrown out of the window.\"\u00a0 He hopes the events over the past several day push the Biden administration to urge Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The measure would restore provisions in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 that required states with a history of discrimination to seek federal approval to change voting laws.\u00a0 \"We're going to make sure we are putting that message out there loud and clear,\" said Williams. \"But more importantly, we've got to educate our community and make sure that they understand that that can never happen again.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "On election night, 2016, then-President Barack Obama called Donald Trump at about 3 a.m. to congratulate him,even though Mr. Trump had lost the popular vote and took the electoral college by less than 1% in three states. Today, President Trump declines to accept the verdict of the voters despite losing by greater margins to President-elect Joe Biden. Mr. Obama hasn't spoken of the election stand-off until today. We spoke to the 44th president on the release of his new book, \"A Promised Land,\" a memoir of his early years and first term. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: What is your advice in this moment for President Trump? Barack Obama: Well, a president is a public servant. They are temporary occupants of the office, by design. And when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments. My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it's time for you to do the same thing.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: In your view, it is time for him to concede? Barack Obama: Absolutely. Well, I mean, I think it was time for him to concede probably-- the day after the election-- or at the latest, two days after the election. When you look at the numbers objectively, Joe Biden will have won handily. There is no scenario in which any of those states would turn the other way, and certainly not enough to reverse the outcome of the election. More than the courtesy of a concession, the Trump White House is declining to free up the usual funds and facilities for the incoming administration. President-elect Biden is not receiving secret national security briefings as Mr. Trump did when he was president-elect. Scott Pelley: What in your estimation would our adversaries be thinking right now, Russia, China, about the fact that the transition is not moving forward? Barack Obama: Well, I-- look, I think our adversaries have seen us weakened, not just as a consequence of this election, but over the last several years. We have these cleavages in the body politic that they're convinced they can exploit. There's an old adage that partisan politics should stop at the water's edge, right? That, when it comes to our foreign policy, that it is the United States of America, not the divided states of America.\u00a0 We met the former president at a symbol of America's past divisions. The Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery was a hospital in the Civil War. Clara Barton and Walt Whitman cared for patients in the building where the 16th president consoled his wounded. We joined Mr. Obama's peers in the gallery of the presidents to talk about his book. Scott Pelley: I'm curious about the title. I think a lot of people feel that we are farther from a promised land. Barack Obama: Well, I titled it \"The Promised Land\" because even though we may not get there in our lifetimes, even if we experience hardships and disappointments along the way, that I at least still have faith we can create a more perfect union. Not a perfect union, but a more perfect union. Scott Pelley: You write in the book, \"Our democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of a crisis.\" What do you mean? Barack Obama: We have gone through a presidency that disregarded a whole host of basic institutional norms, expectations we had for a president that had been observed by Republicans and Democrats previously. And maybe most importantly, and most disconcertingly, what we've seen is what some people call truth decay, something that's been accelerated by outgoing President Trump, the sense that not only do we not have to tell the truth, but the truth doesn't even matter. Scott Pelley: What are these false claims of widespread election fraud doing to our country right now? Barack Obama: The president doesn't like to lose and-- never admits loss. I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that's a dangerous path. We would never accept that out of our own kids behaving that way if they lost, right? I mean, if my daughters, in any kinda competition, pouted and-- and then accused the other side of cheating when they lost, when there was no evidence of it, we'd scold 'em. I think that there has been this sense over the last several years that literally anything goes and is justified in order to get power. And that's not unique to the United States. There are strong men and dictators around the world who think that, \"I can do anything to stay in power. I can kill people. I can throw them in jail. I can run phony elections. I can suppress journalists.\" But that's not who we're supposed to be. And one of the signals I think that Joe Biden needs to send to the world is that, \"No, those values that we preached, and we believed in, and subscribed in-- we still believe.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: President-elect Biden won in this election more votes than anyone in history. And yet, the 2020 vote wasn't a repudiation of Donald Trump; it was more like an affirmation. He received 71 million votes, 8 million more than he did in 2016. What does that tell you about our country today? Barack Obama: Well, A. it tells us that we're very divided. And as I said, it's not just the politicians now. The voters are divided. It has now become a contest where issues, facts, policies per se don't matter as much as identity and wanting to beat the other guy. You know, that's taken priority. I do think the current media environment adds to that greatly. This democracy doesn't work if we don't have an informed citizenry. This democracy doesn't work if we don't have responsible elected officials at other levels who are willing to call the president when he's not doing something right, call him on it. Scott Pelley: It seems, though, Mr. President, that Americans have gone from disagreeing with one another to hating one another, a problem that this man had. (Pointing to portrait of Abraham Lincoln) Barack Obama: He's a good example of somebody who I think understood deeply the need to be able to see another person's point of view. Scott Pelley: How do we overcome where we are today? Barack Obama: There's no American figure that I admire any more than Abraham Lincoln. But he did end up-- with a civil war on his hands. I think we'd like to avoid that. I do think that a new president can set a new tone. That's not gonna solve all the gridlock in Washington. I think we're gonna have to work with the media and with the tech companies to find ways to inform the public better about the issues and to-- bolster the standards that ensure we can separate truth from fiction. I think that we have to work at a local level. When you start getting to the local level, mayors-- county commissioners, et cetera, they've actually gotta make real decisions. It's not abstractions. It's like, \"We need to fix this road. We need to get this snow plowed. We need to make sure our kids have a safe playground to-- to-- to play in.\" And at that level, I don't think people have that kind of-- visceral hatred. And that's where we have to start in terms of rebuilding the social trust we need for democracy to work. Mr. Obama is speaking after four years of virtual silence on Donald Trump. He followed a traditional commandment largely observed since adams succeeded washington \u2013thou shall not criticize your successor. In \"A Promised Land\" he wonders if that was a mistake. Scott Pelley: In your book, you ask, quote, \"Whether I was too tempered in speaking the truth, too cautious in word or deed.\" Many Americans, Mr. President, believe you were too cautious, too tempered. Barack Obama: Yeah. And-- and-- and I think that' a legitimate and understandable criticism. At the end of the day, I consistently tried to treat my political opposition in the ways I'd want to be treated, To not overreact when, for example, somebody yells, \"You lie,\" in the middle of me giving a joint congressional address.\u00a0 Barack Obama: I understand why there were times where my supporters wanted me to be more pugilistic, to, you know, pop folks in the head and duke it out a little bit more. Scott Pelley: Was it a mistake that you didn't? Barack Obama: Every president brings a certain temperament to office. I think part of the reason I got elected was because I sent a message that fundamentally I believe the American people are good and decent, and that politics doesn't have to be some cage match in-- in which everybody is-- is going at each other's throats and that we can agree without being disagreeable. There have been worse presidential transitions than 2020. The southern states seceded while Lincoln was president-elect. Still, we couldn't help but notice, outside the national portrait gallery, businesses are still boarded up against the fear of political violence.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: What should President Trump do on this next inauguration day? Barack Obama: Look there are a set of traditions that we have followed in the peaceful transfer of power. The outgoing president congratulates the incoming president, instructs the government and the agencies to cooperate with the new government coming in. You invite the president-elect to the Oval Office And then on inauguration day, the president invites the president-elect to the White House and there's a small reception. And then you drive to the inauguration site, and the outgoing president sits there and is part of the audience as the new president is sworn in. And at that point, the outgoing president is a citizen like everybody else and owes the new president the chance to do their best on behalf of the American people. Whether Donald Trump will do the same thing we'll have to see. So far, that's not been his approach. But you know hope springs eternal. There's a promised land out there somewhere. Two hours after Mr. Obama said that, President Trump tweeted from the White House, \"We will win\" even though no state is reporting fraud or errors that could change the outcome. During Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009, unknown to the public, there was intelligence that a terrorist attack was planned. President Obama had, at the podium, instructions he would read to the crowd should there be an evacuation of nearly 2 million people from the National Mall. This is one of the insights in Mr. Obama's new book, \"A Promised Land,\" a memoir of his early years, his historic election, and his first term. We spoke to the 44th president about battles past and present. Scott Pelley: Did you watch the video of George Floyd's strangulation? Barack Obama: Of course. It was heartbreaking. Very rarely, though, did you see it so viscerally and over a stretch of time where the humanity of the victim is so apparent, the pain and the vulnerability of someone so clear. And it was, I think, a moment in which America for a brief moment came face to face with a reality that African Americans in this country I think had understood for quite some time. And I was heartened and inspired by the galvanizing effect that it had on the country as a whole. The fact that it wasn't just Black people. It wasn't just some, quote/unquote, \"liberals\" who were appalled by it, reacted to it, and eventually marched. But it was everybody. And it was a small first step in the kind of reckoning with our past and our present that so often we avoid.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: But Mr. President, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, why is this injustice never overcome? Barack Obama: Well, it, for a couple of reasons. One is that we have a criminal justice system in which we ask oftentimes very young, oftentimes not-very-well-trained officers to go into communities and just keep a lid on things. And, you know, we don't try to get at some of the underlying causes for chronic poverty. So if we're going to actually solve this problem, there are some specific things we can do to make sure that our contracts with police officers don't completely insulate them when they do something wrong, putting money into budgets for training these police officers more effectively, teaching police officers not to escalate but to de-escalate. But it's important for us not to let ourselves off the hook and think this is just a police problem, because those shootings, that devaluation of life is part and parcel with a legacy of discrimination, and Jim Crow, and segregation that we're all responsible for. And if we're gonna actually put an end to racial bias in the criminal justice system, then we're gonna have to work on doing something about racial bias in corporate America and bias in where people can buy homes. And that is a larger project in which all of the good news is all of us can take some responsibility. We-- we can all do better on this front than we've been doing. We joined the president this past Wednesday behind masks and then kept our distance as the U.S. counted 143,000 known COVID infections that day, a new record. Mr. Obama had also faced an outbreak in his first term\u2014a new flu, H1N1. Barack Obama: I was terrified of it and very quickly mobilized a team to figure out, \"How are we gonna take the best possible approach?\" And from the start, I had some very clear criteria which it was, number one, we're gonna follow the science. And the second thing was, \"Let's make sure we're providing good information to the American people.\" But H1N1, was not as contagious nor as lethal as COVID. It ultimately killed 12,000 Americans. Other battles in his book include the financial crisis, passing the affordable care act, the decision to kill Osama bin Laden and leaving eight years of work in the hands of another.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: You begin the book by writing about the day that you left Washington, quote, \"to someone diametrically opposed to everything we stood for.\" Barack Obama: That may be the one thing that Donald Trump and I agree on, is that he doesn't agree with me on anything. I don't see him as the cause for our divisions and the problems with our government. I think he's an accelerant, but they preceded him. and sadly are gonna likely outlast him. Scott Pelley: You write in the book that Republicans had a battle plan to, quote, \"Refuse to work with me, regardless of the circumstances, the issue, or the consequences for the country.\" Now, the same might be said of Democrats in a Republican administration. I wonder if today you think that Democrats and Republicans are no longer capable of compromise. Barack Obama: First of all, I don't think this is just a plague on both their houses here. So, the Democrats opposed George Bush on a whole buncha stuff. But Ted Kennedy worked with George Bush to pass a prescription drug plan for seniors. Nancy Pelosi, who adamantly opposed the war in Iraq, time and again voted, even when her base was angry about it, to make sure that our troops were funded once the decision to send in troops to Iraq went in.\u00a0 Mr. Obama blames gridlock on something old and something new, the Senate's filibuster tradition which allows whatever party is in the minority to block legislation and nontraditional media. Barack Obama: The media landscape has changed. And as a consequence, voters' perceptions have changed. So that I think Democratic and Republican voters have become much more partisan. I would often hear this from Republicans during my presidency, some of these folks have been colleagues of mine. I served in the Senate. Some of them were friends of mine. And they would confess to me and said, \"Look, Mr. President, I know you're right. But if I vote with you on this, I'm gonna get killed. I'll lose my seat.\" Because what had happened is their voter base had soaked in so much information that was demonizing me, demonizing the Affordable Care Act, that it becomes very difficult, even for folks who want to cooperate, to cooperate. And that's why I am somebody who does not blame the current partisanship solely on Donald Trump or solely on social media. You already saw some of these trends taking place early in my presidency. But I do think they've kept on getting worse. The former president also writes about his unlikely rise\u2014including the obstacles at home. Scott Pelley: You're surprisingly honest in the book about your wife's opposition to you running for president in 2008. You quote her as saying, \"The answer is no. I do not want you running for president. God, Barack, when is it going to be enough?\" Did I get the tone right? Barack Obama: It was a little sharper than that, but it was pretty good, Scott. Scott Pelley: And then she walks out of the room. Why did that not stop you? Barack Obama: Look, it's a legitimate question. Keep in mind the context here. We had-- just two years earlier, I'd run for the U.S. Senate in an unlikely race. Two years before that, I had run for Congress.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: In a race you lost. Barack Obama: In a race I lost. A couple years before that, I had run for the state senate. We'd got two young kids. Michelle's still working. And I ask myself in the book, you know, \"How much of this is just megalomania? How much of this is vanity? How much of this is me trying to-- prove something to myself?\" And over time she made a conclusion that, \"I shouldn't stand in the way of this.\" She then-- Scott Pelley: That she should not stand in the way of your ambitions-- Barack Obama: Yeah. Scott Pelley: --to be president? Barack Obama: Yeah. And-- and-- and she did so grudgingly. And the fact that I ended up winning didn't necessarily alleviate her frustration because the toll it takes on families is real.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: I think it's only after you emerge from an all-consuming job that you realize that everything you hold dear is thanks to the one you love. Barack Obama: I think I actually realized that even while I was in the job. The fact that she put up with it and forgave me is\u2014was an act of grace that I am grateful for and I'm not sure I deserved it Today, at the age of 59, Mr. Obama is working on his presidential center. Barack Obama: So this is gonna be on the South Side of Chicago in historic Jackson Park. And it's the place where Michelle and I met, where I first started in public life. His team brought this model to show us. Mr. Obama's foundation has raised, from private donations, a little over half the estimated 500 million dollar cost. It will take about four years once they start. Barack Obama: It's gonna be a place where, you know, we have the standard model Oval Office, and Michelle's dresses, which will be very popular no doubt. But also, you know, a whole host of facilities that allow us to provide classroom training to young people who are interested in public service, and to beautify a park that can serve a whole bunch of young people who've been underserved in the past. In his last moments in the Oval Office Mr. Obama left a note in the president's desk for his successor. It read, in part, \"We are just temporary occupants of this office... It's up to us to leave the... instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.\" Barack Obama: On that last day-- the emotions really focus on the team that you've been working on. And it's very rare outside of maybe wartime where you get a collection of people working together in a sustained way under that kind of pressure and stress. And so there's a melancholy to it. There was also though, and I write about this, a satisfaction in knowing that I had finished the job, I had run my stretch of the race.\u00a0 And I could say unequivocally, despite regrets and disappointments about some things not getting done-- the country was better off when I left than when I got there.\u00a0 Produced by Maria Gavrilovic.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the countdown to Election Day continues and a political fight over President Trump's Supreme Court nominee begins. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. MARGARET BRENNAN: Late Saturday, President Trump introduced his pick to succeed RBG. Meet ACB, a conservative federal appeals court judge, who is also a working mother of seven. AMY CONEY BARRETT: While I am a judge, I'm better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver and birthday party planner. MARGARET BRENNAN: If confirmed, the Supreme Court would shift even further to the right, the prospect of which is making the final days of an already bitter and brutal presidential campaign even more divisive. AMY CONEY BARRETT: I have no illusions that the road ahead of me will be easy. I assure you that I will meet the challenge with both humility and courage. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former White House counsel Don McGahn about Judge Barrett's confirmation, as well as the President's refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses in November. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's the only way we're going to lose is if there's mischief, mischief. And it will have to be on a big scale. So be careful. MARGARET BRENNAN: Delaware Democrat Chris Coons sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he'll weigh in, as will former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Plus, we'll check in with former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb and talk with Doug Parker, the CEO of American Airlines. Their voice to layoff nineteen thousand workers this week as a result of a COVID economy. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning. And welcome to FACE THE NATION. With just over a month until Election Day, Capitol Hill has become the new battleground in a fierce dispute over the makeup of the Supreme Court. Last night, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said he expected to start Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings in just two weeks. President Trump told Fox News that he thinks she'll be confirmed before, and probably long before Election Day. We begin this morning with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who joins us from Washington. Good morning to you. MARK MEADOWS (White House Chief of Staff/@MarkMeadows): Good morning. Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have Republican leaders assured you they can deliver on that timeline? MARK MEADOWS: Well, obviously, I've-- we've been in conversations with Leader McConnell, with Chairman Graham, he is going to put forth a pretty aggressive schedule for hearings and markups that we believe will happen in the middle part of October. And if all goes well, then certainly a-- a-- a vote on the floor sometime before the election. But that's going to be up to Leader McConnell and-- and the team and making sure that all the senators are well informed of the judge's credentials, which are impeccable. But we're-- we're optimistic that we'll be prepared. We'll start delivering the information to the senators tomorrow and then we'll be on Capitol Hill as early as Tuesday. MARGARET BRENNAN: As early as Tuesday. Sir, when I look at some of the data right now in terms of where the country is with the coronavirus, there are four U.S. states, including Wisconsin, that have had record one-day increases. We're going into cold weather. We're headed towards Election Day. Where's the infection rate going to be? MARK MEADOWS: Well, it's hard to tell where the infection rate is going to be. But what I can tell you is the progress with vaccines has just been remarkable. We've had a-- a number of conversations with not only the FDA and those that are involved in making sure that any vaccine is-- is fully vetted and safe. But additionally, some of the clinical trials are in the-- the very late stages of development. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK MEADOWS: And so we're optimistic that what we'll be able to do is hopefully start taking sign up for those vaccines. And so even as we face this unknown virus that came to us from China, we're trying to make sure that we're prepared to do all we can to mitigate the-- the difficult circumstances that a lot of Americans are facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the predictions are not that you could have a vaccine by Election Day, and it is relevant in terms of the infection rate because people have to have confidence to be able to go out and go to the polls. If you look at data from AEI, hospitalizations are no longer declining. In fact, they may be increasing. It doesn't look like this is under control. MARK MEADOWS: Well, the hospitalization rate is-- if you'll look at that data, whether it's from AEI or anywhere else, the hospitalization rate actually has been a-- a good news story over the last several months. To suggest that it is spiking up is-- is not accurate. MARGARET BRENNAN: I said increasing. MARK MEADOWS: But I can-- but-- but-- but I can tell you that, well, you know, one or two increases in certain states, certainly we're going to continue to fight this as those embers pop up in-- in areas. But we're having ongoing discussions with our governors in mitigation risk. There will be an announcement on Monday as it looks at additional testing that the federal government will be providing to all the governors. And so, as the President makes that announcement, I think that will be an encouragement so that everybody can go back to school or back to work and feel like they can do that in a safe manner. MARGARET BRENNAN: You talked about a vaccine. The FDA is supposed to be issuing these stricter guidelines. We've been told to expect that. MARK MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then you-- MARK MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --reportedly called the FDA commissioner and really challenged him on trying to justify doing that. MARK MEADOWS: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not a doctor. Why insert yourself politically into this which-- MARK MEADOWS: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --which feeds these concerns-- MARK MEADOWS: So, Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --about interference? MARK MEADOWS: So, Margaret, obviously your producer didn't do a good job of informing you of exactly what I've done. What we actually have is new guidance that's coming out. My question is, why would that new guidance come out after we've already spent thirty billion dollars in doing that? And my challenge to the FDA is just make sure it's based on science-- science and real numbers. And so as we look at that, we're making very good progress-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would the FDA not be basing it on science and real numbers? Why would you think that they're doing that? MARK MEADOWS: Well, why would you think that we would need new guidance after we've developed vaccines and drugs for-- for decades and then all of a sudden we're-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The FDA said they were going to. MARK MEADOWS: --going to change something in the-- in the last two weeks? The question is why, Margaret. I mean, why would we do that? I'd also look at this. And as we got into that discussion, here's one of the great things that we're looking at. If we're looking at tens of thousands of people that are in these clinical trials, we want to make sure that it's safe. The phase one, phase two indicated that-- that these vaccines that are going through are safe. We're trying to make sure that the guidance we give is not a-- a-- a inhibitor to getting things out fast-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK MEADOWS: --but it also doesn't detract from it. So I'm optimistic that that guidance will come out based on good science-- science and ultimately our FDA guidelines to make sure that all people who take a vaccine can do that with some kind of assurance that the process is meted out properly. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were on another show on this network earlier this week, and-- and you raised questions about the competence of the current FBI Director Chris Wray after he testified that there was no evidence of voter fraud in a major election by mail or otherwise. Is the President confident in Director Wray's leadership? MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think my-- my reference to that particular point said that he couldn't find e-mails at the FBI. And so to opine on whether we have wide scale fraud or not, is-- is not him that's with boots on the ground. You know and I know that there's actually an investigation that the Department of Justice have-- has initiated-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK MEADOWS: --with some ballots being thrown at a wastepaper basket. What we want to make sure of is that every vote counts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nine ballots in Pennsylvania. MARK MEADOWS: But-- but-- nine ballots, but that's what we found. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK MEADOWS: And so we need to make sure that we investigate it. But it's not just the nine ballots in Pennsylvania. It's duplicate ballots in other states. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- MARK MEADOWS: And so to suggest that-- that there is a process that is full of integrity is-- is trying to make a verdict before you've actually heard the case. And that's my-- my problem with Director Wray. They need to investigate it and make sure that-- that the voting populace makes sure that their-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident in him? MARK MEADOWS: --vote counts and no one else's does. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President confident in him? MARK MEADOWS: I beg your pardon? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President confident in him? MARK MEADOWS: Well, I mean, as we look at this, we want to make sure he's doing his job. There are different degrees of confidence in different cabinet members. And certainly he's still there. The-- the minute that the President loses confidence in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK MEADOWS: --any of his Cabinet members, he'll-- they serve at his pleasure, and he will certainly look at replacing them. MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS estimates that at least eighty million Americans are going to vote by mail. That's what they plan to do. But the President said last night the whole ballot scam is going to cause a lot of problems for this country. MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is he publicly undermining confidence in that? MARK MEADOWS: Well, I don't know that he's publicly undermining confidence as much as he's stating the facts. We've got states that are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it's a scam. MARK MEADOWS: Well-- well, we've got states that actually are doing things that you would qualify as a scam when you start to look at allowing mail-in ballots to come in seven, nine days after November 3rd, changing the laws through judges that actually are not legislators. I-- I think that that's a real problem. And so you can call it what you will-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK MEADOWS: --but what you can call it is unusual and unique. And-- and we need to make sure that what we do is-- is protect the ballot process-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. MARK MEADOWS: --to make sure that we're not creating a situation that is ripe with fraud. And he's right to-- to highlight it. The very fact that we're talking about it this morning-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK MEADOWS: --is a good thing that hopefully all states will look at making sure that they make sure that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MARK MEADOWS: --that ballot is sacred. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And it is up to the states to determine those. We'll talk about that ahead on the program. Thank you, Chief. MARK MEADOWS: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He's in Wilmington. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-Delaware/@ChrisCoons): Good morning, Margaret, great to be on with you again. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Mark Meadows' confidence and the timeline in the confirmation of-- of Judge Barrett. You're laughing. It doesn't seem, though, that the Democrats can do much to stop it. Will Democrats do anything to slow it down? Will they boycott hearings? How serious are you about trying to throw sand in the gears? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Margaret, what I was shaking my head about was having just heard Mark Meadows breathlessly trying to support President Trump's desperate efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of this election. We should not be barreling forward with this partisan nomination. There's only thirty-seven days until the election. There is no precedent in American history for a president filling a vacancy this close to an election, where I'll remind you, more than half of the American states are already voting. We should be waiting until after the election. We should honor-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --Justice Ginsburg's dying wish that the people should choose the next president, the next president choose her successor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Eisenhower recess-appointed Brennan twenty-two days before the election, but I understand that was without Senate consent. So I hear your point. But the question was, are Democrats going to do anything to slow this down? Some of your colleagues are saying they won't even meet with the nominee. What will you ask her when you meet with her? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, I'm either going to meet with her in person or by phone, just another way this pandemic has upended the lives of millions of Americans. I'll press her on her previous statements about the Affordable Care Act. President Trump said he would only choose a nominee he was confident would overturn the Affordable Care Act. And as you know, Margaret, that's on the Supreme Court's docket just one week after the election. It defies comprehension why President Trump would continue in his efforts to strip away from the American people pre-existing discrimination protection. There's more than a hundred million Americans who have a pre-existing condition-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --seven million more because they've been infected in this pandemic. And I'll remind you, Margaret, Justice Ginsburg's life's work was protecting us against gender discrimination. And before the ACA, insurance companies could and did discriminate against women just for being women by treating pregnancy as a pre-existing condition, charging women more for access to health insurance. It's amazing to me that Judge Barrett has publicly criticized the decision by Chief Justice Roberts-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --that upheld the constitutionality of the ACA and that President Trump is making it clear-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --a vote for Judge Barrett to be on the Supreme Court is a vote to repeal the ACA and take away health care protection from a majority of Americans during a pandemic. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. Judge Barrett introduced herself to the American public as a mother of seven, as sort of a class mom-- SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes. MARGARET BREANNAN: --a very warm presentation in-- in the public space. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you fight that? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, we don't need to fight that, I can respect the fact that she has a beautiful family, that her clerks and students say she's a very talented professor and judge, that's not what's at issue here. What's at issue is both this rushed and partisan confirmation in which President Trump has told us he's choosing someone who will overturn Roe versus Wade, he's choosing someone who will overturn the ACA, and he's choosing someone who President Trump himself says-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --he will need to put their thumb on the scale so that he can win the next election. He's not confident he'll win it fair and square at the ballot box. He says we have to rush through this nominee so that there's nine justices and one he handpicks to, according to President Trump, support him in his reelection effort. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he said he want-- he believes it'll go to the court and be decided. I understand your points. As you know, with individual cases, judges sometimes are hard to predict, even though you can kind of guess where they stand ideologically. But on the question for her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett has been before your committee before because she-- she was confirmed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. And at the time, Senator Feinstein said to her, and, you know what I'm going to say to you, because it's gone viral, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is of concern.\" To many people that sounded like anti-Catholic bigotry. You are a man of faith. How did that comment land with you? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, Margaret, as you know, millions of Americans rely on our faith to guide us, to give us a framework in which we raise our children and live our lives, a community of meaning and of depth and religious faith should not be at issue here. There isn't a religious test for service in the government, whether it's in the Senate or on the Supreme Court. And if Judge Barrett is confirmed I know that justice-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Should it-- is that a legitimate question? Should that be raised as a factor? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: What should be raised is her opinions, her speeches, her public statements as a professor and a judge, and whether or not she will uphold precedent, as you well know Margaret, Roe versus Wade, Griswold versus Connecticut, these are settled cases that for decades have allowed Americans to have confidence about the role of the state in terms of their private decisions about health care. And the Affordable Care Act is settled law. The Supreme Court has upheld it as being constitutional. That's on the docket a week after this election. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: That's on the ballot, and that's something Judge Barrett has spoken directly about. It is appropriate for us to question her statements, her opinions, her actions as a professor and judge, but not to go into questions of doctrine or faith personally. That's where I'll be focusing my questions on the Affordable Care Act and on what she has said publicly about her views on its constitutionality. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, first, presidential debate is this week. You support Joe Biden. What should we expect? Is this going to be the main argument? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: You should expect that President Trump, who is a very successful reality TV star, is a master of spectacle. He will say whatever it takes in order to distract us from Joe Biden, who will again show us his heart, his compassion, his character. Joe Biden has laid out a clear and strong plan for how to get us out of this pandemic, for how to bring us back together, for how to revive our economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Joe's going to focus on that, and Donald Trump's going to try and distract us however he can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Coons, thank you. We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Part of his job in that role was combating election interference. He's in Montclair, New Jersey. Good morning to you. JEH JOHNSON (Former Homeland Security Secretary): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: It is ultimately up to the states to administer elections. What are your concerns about the integrity and the security of this race? JEH JOHNSON: Well, first, Margaret, it's-- it's disconcerting to see the president and his chief of staff cast doubt on the integrity of our-- our democracy. In fact, mail-in voting is almost as old as-- as the nation. There are states now where the predominant way to vote is by mail. And we-- we managed to have a peaceful election in 1944 during World War II. We managed to have a relatively calm, peaceful election in 1864 when the nation was literally at war with it-- with itself. And so my concern is that the President himself seems to be the one casting doubt on-- on mail-in votes in particular. The documented cases of fraud around mail-in voting is a small fraction of something like one percent. Now, having said that, I think all Americans should plan how they are going to vote. What is unusual about this election is that we're going to have to move something like one hundred million mail-in ballots. And so I would encourage Americans to plan their vote. Vote early, whether it's in person or by mail. I got mine yesterday in the mail, and I plan to return it as soon as possible. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are in New Jersey, which is allowing mail-in this year on a large scale. You know, the President said that he thinks this will end up in the Supreme Court. I understand what you're saying about undermining the overall integrity, but many people would say we've never done this before. It is going to be messy. So is that not a fair question to ask is-- is how can we actually do this? JEH JOHNSON: Well, the reality is, Margaret, that our demo-- one of the special things about our democracy is that whatever power President Trump has evaporates on January 20th at noon. And whoever has two hundred and seventy electoral votes at that moment, and we can talk about the wisdom of the Electoral College, becomes the president and at that moment becomes commander-in-chief, becomes the director of the executive branch, and the-- the other candidate walks off as a private citizen. That's how we've been doing things for almost two hundred and fifty years. And I'm confident that we will continue to do it in that way. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying at noon-- 12:01, on January 20th, the Secret Service would escort out President Trump if he loses, that a peaceful transition of power you are confident will happen? JEH JOHNSON: It's the way our democracy works, Margaret. The President doesn't get to stay in power simply by surrounding himself with the tools and the vestiges of power. Whatever power this President has evaporates at noon on January 20, 2021. And whoever has the requisite number of Electoral-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JEH JOHNSON: --College votes is the next president. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it may be messy getting to that point. The-- the Senate was briefed on election security this week. Senator Mark Warner said, \"\u2026the period immediately before and after the election could be uniquely volatile.\" What does that suggest to you? JEH JOHNSON: Well, the-- in terms of the-- the external threat, the threat from the Russians and others, I-- I agree with what the FBI director said this past week, that we have to be on guard, in particular for disinformation, pushing out extremist views, fake news, which is why I think all Americans should take the trouble to inform themselves about how they're going to exercise their vote and-- and look past the noise. Without a doubt, this election will be unusual because of the number of mail-in ballots, but we've done this before. We've done this since almost the beginning of our democracy. The other unusual thing about this is you have a President who, frankly, is trying to ratchet up the anxiety-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEH JOHNSON: --and the concern about our democracy. I think all Americans have to have history in mind and know that we have a strong constitutional system. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as you know, conservatives have seized on a comment by former Secretary Hillary Clinton when she said, Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out. Since that time, her aides have said that was just specific to election night. But other Democrats have said she shouldn't have said that at all. You think that's damaging? JEH JOHNSON: The way I would put it is this, Margaret, whoever does not win the election should have more respect for the constitution and our democracy rather than his own political fortunes. And we've seen that time and again. For example, the very eloquent concession speech by John McCain-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEH JOHNSON: --in 2008. The-- the candidate has to care more about the democracy than whether or not he or she wins. That's the way I'd put it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, you're a former prosecutor. The Breonna Taylor decision in Louisville is continuing to lead to protests. What do you make of that case? JEH JOHNSON: Well, I hesitate to sit in judgment if I'm not privy to all the evidence. The charge that has been brought up against this particular officer, I think it's wanton endangerment. It's-- it's as if you're acting in a mode of self-defense, but you're firing into a crowded theater indiscriminately. It's hard for me to distinguish that and that charge against that officer and those who fired directly at Breonna Taylor. But we'll know more soon is my hope. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Secretary Johnson, thank you for your insight. And we will be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News estimates this year that at least eighty million people will vote early in person or by mail. That's a big increase from 2016. Make sure you have a plan on how you will vote and where. Go to cbsnews.com/vote. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Up next is former White House counsel Don McGahn. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I want to go now to former White House counsel Don McGahn. He joins us from Owings Mills, Maryland. Thank you for joining us. DON MCGAHN (Former White House Counsel): Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. You know Amy Coney Barrett. You vetted her. You put her on the list of judges in the first place that was considered by President Trump, but he passed her over last time and went with Brett Kavanaugh. What gave you pause then? And are you certain she will be confirmed this time? DON MCGAHN: I think-- I think the President has made an outstanding choice in nominating her. He promised justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia, a great justice. She clerked for Scalia, became a protege of his and I think she's a fantastic judge. There's no reason why the Senate shouldn't confirm her. And I think she's already had a distinguished career on the bench and it will continue on in the Supreme Court. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what gave pause last time? I mean, some-- sometimes it's hard to predict how judges will actually rule on individual cases. But is there something that we should be scrutinizing here in terms of her stance? I mean Democrats are assuming she's against Affordable Care and against Roe versus Wade? Are those fair assumptions? DON MCGAHN: I don't think they're fair assumptions one way or the other. We've heard this for decades in Washington, DC. I remember being a-- a very young law student and hearing this about Robert Bork and hearing this about Clarence Thomas and hearing this about virtually every justice that's been nominated by a Republican. You cannot guarantee results with judges. What you can guarantee is that they are going to approach the task of judging as a judge. They're not going to substitute their own policy views for the will of the people. They're going to try to play it straight and read the law as passed by Congress and as found in the Constitution, not based upon what they think it ought to be, but what it is. I disagree that there is any hesitancy or pause last time. She was a relatively new federal judge. She was placed on a short list. The public found out about the short list because it was publicly announced. So the process has really been transparent. Recall the President, even as a candidate, put out not one, but two lists of judges-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DON MCGAHN: --who could be on the Supreme Court; he's updated it a few times since. So I think that at the time, Brett Kavanaugh was the right person at the right time. And I think Amy-- Judge Amy Barrett is the right person at the right time now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is Senator McConnell rushing this through now? Some people are speculating it's because he thinks Trump might lose or that Republicans want her vote there as the debate over Obamacare begins. Why rush it? DON MCGAHN: I-- I disagree that it's being rushed. I think it actually-- if you look at historical precedent is following regular order. One goes back into history, one goes close to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty short timeline. DON MCGAHN: Most-- well, Frankfurter went through twelve days start to finish. You can say, well, that's ancient history. What about modern times? John Paul Stevens who has become a hero of the left, went through sixteen days, start to finish. Sandra Day O'Connor went through in thirty-three days, start to finish and Ruth Bader Ginsburg went from forty-two days, start to finish. So there is time to do it. It is not outside of the norm. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it's about the election? DON MCGAHN: Well, I certainly think that there's an imminent election and obviously everyone's talking about the election, but I think when the President makes a nomination, he's obligated to do so under the Constitution. This has happened twenty-nine times in our history where there's been an election year-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DON MCGAHN: --nomination, and it's happened before. It'll probably happen again. And even Justice Kennedy, who many hold up as a-- as a model justice was, was confirmed and appointed in an election year in 1988 when President Reagan wasn't even on the ballot. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DON MCGAHN: So this idea that somehow this is out of the norm simply doesn't ring true. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were at the White House, this was your project. And looking at Pew Research-- DON MCGAHN: One of many, but yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of many. Fair. But President Trump-- we'll get to that, President Trump has appointed more federal appeals court judges to date than any recent President. He's not sitting around reading legal briefs. As you talked about, there's a list that was put in front of him of possible choices. You've been working with Mitch McConnell to really have this be a conveyor belt that has helped to confirm these in-- in a high number. But, do you worry that that kind of churn in this process can-- can undermine faith that-- that the court is above the political fray? DON MCGAHN: Well, the court ought to be above the political fray. That's the point of the court. We have three coequal branches and the court is supposed to be removed from it. It's done in a variety of ways. One is life tenure. Two is the confirmation process itself. And the President can't simply pick. It has to do with the advice and consent of the Senate. But I think if you look at the judges President Trump's put on the bench, it's going to go down in history as a-- as a monumental achievement of his presidency. He has put a number of-- of judges on who are immediately qualified, went to top schools, did well in the schools. They went to the clerk at the Supreme Court themselves, they're A list circuit judges, had a stellar careers-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's your list. I know you like it. But-- DON MCGAHN: (AUDIO CUT) pardon? MARGARET BRENNAN: I said it's your list. I know you like it. But-- but-- DON MCGAHN: Oh. Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --so-- so bigger picture, though-- DON MCGAHN: Doesn't change the credentials, though. I mean, just because I like-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I'm not saying that. No. DON MCGAHN: Great. But if you look at the facts-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DON MCGAHN: --it's fantastic judges. There's really no arguing with the-- with the merit of the-- of these nominees. MARGARET BRENNAN Your name appears in the Mueller report five hundred and twenty-nine times. DON MCGAHN: And Amy Barrett's name appears nowhere in the Mueller report. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. DON MCGAHN: And she just got nominated for the Supreme Court. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand, but we're talking about justice and judges. Given the President's challenges with the law and his obligation under the Constitution to-- to take care that the law be faithfully executed, do you think there's a contradiction here? Do you think he deserves four more years in office? DON MCGAHN: I think if you look at his record, he does. He had the economy going wonderfully, he made a number of promises on the campaign trail that he kept. MARGARET BRENNAN: You will vote for him? DON MCGAHN: One is his judicial selection, which he's done. He's set a record number of judges on there-- on the circuit courts and this really matters. And look, there's been-- since the '16 election, he has made this a-- a-- a critical issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DON MCGAHN: He was very transparent on it. It really helped in the 2016 election. And there's been an intervening election and two Supreme Court nominees and confirmations and those who supported Trump's judicial nominations did pretty well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DON MCGAHN: --on re-election. Those who opposed did not. MARGARET BREANNAN: I'm going to-- DON MCGAHN: So the people have spoken not once but twice. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I'm going to take that as a yes for you, from you that you're voting for him again. All right. Don McGahn, thank you this morning for your insight. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Last Sunday, you said there are thirty states where there's an expanding epidemic. We spoke to the White House chief of staff this morning and pointed out to him that-- that hospitalizations are no longer declining. What do we need to be prepared for? What does this trend indicate? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think there's still a question whether or not this is the beginning of an upsurge heading into the fall and the winter or we're seeing sort of a post Labor Day bounce. Clearly, we've seen a rise in cases across the country right now, hospitalizations, as you said, they were declining, they're no longer declining. There's some indication it's starting to rise again, which would be expected now that cases are going up. Whether this is the start of a persistent trend heading into the fall, in the winter, or it's just a temporary upsurge and we level off again, is unclear. I think that there's a lot of concern that we could start to see a real upsurge and this is a continuation of a broader trend underway as we head into the colder months. We were always facing heightened risk of increased spread of coronavirus as we headed into the fall and winter. Now we're there. We're starting to see that increase, and we're taking a lot of infection into a very dangerous season for this virus. MARGARET BRENNAN: The-- the chief of staff talked about his conversation with the FDA and drawing into question their revision to guidance, but he said it will be forthcoming on the vaccine. What did you interpret his comments to mean? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I-- I don't think that this guidance represented a revision in the agency standards or any-- any kind of high-- higher bar. What this was, was an articulation of the principles and standards that the FDA has been using for a long time and, frankly, been communicating to the companies that are developing vaccines. So a lot of these principles have already been communicated to the companies are-- and are, in fact, being followed. And as you know, I'm on the board of Pfizer, but I also talked to a lot of the other clinical development leads and the other companies working on vaccines. And I think that there was widespread agreement that these principles, as they were discussed in the press, were mostly in line with everyone's expectations. And so whether or not the agency issues the guidance, I think this is going to be the basis for which they make decisions. Now, I would prefer that they're able to issue the guidance in its entirety in the way that they envision it because that would provide more transparency around the basis that they're using to judge these vaccines. But whether they release it or they don't, I think these are going to be the principles that govern that process. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what should we expect from a vaccine? Doctor Fauci said this week that it won't be one hundred percent effective. What can Americans expect? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we don't know yet. We don't have the data. There's major trials underway with more than thirty thousand patients in each trial. Pfizer enrolled forty-four thousand, Moderna thirty thousand, J&J just announced a trial with sixty thousand patients. These are major outcomes trials. So we should wait and see what the data ultimately shows. But the expectation is that this vaccine is going to be partially protective, a lot like the flu vaccine, where for certain people it will provide full immunity, but for other people it's not going to provide as much protection. Maybe it will lessen the severity of COVID if they contract the infection. But it's not going to provide what we call sterile immunity, which-- which means you're not going to be able to get infected with COVID. There will be some people who still get infected with COVID. That's the expectation. Now, it could be that the vaccines prove to be much more effective than we expect. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It could be that the vaccines prove to be a lot less effective than we expect. But I think that should be the base case, the-- the basic expectation of individuals. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree with the CDC director that ninety percent of Americans remain susceptible to this virus? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's what the data shows, I mean, CDC has some data that they've developed looking at antibodies across the country, basically layering tests onto normal blood draws being done by LabCorp and Quest to look at how many Americans have antibodies to coronavirus. And so they're deriving some of that information from that very large project that they've undertaken. But other studies seem to indicate about the same thing. About ten percent of Americans have been exposed to this virus. The best modeling that I've seen that suggests that there could be a higher-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --rate of exposure suggests that maybe it's as high as fifteen percent. But most of the models project around ten percent. So it means a lot of the country is still very susceptible to this virus. There's a lot of room for it to run. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And-- and, you know, I ask you that because one of the members of the task force, Doctor Scott Atlas, directly refuted the CDC director. So I just wanted to be on the record clarifying that. There have been a lot of reports out there that even if you get COVID and you survive, that you have related health problems afterwards. What do we know at this point, what the impact of the virus is? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: We don't know the full impact on the virus. What we're seeing in-- in various studies is that there is some long-term sequelae related to the virus, so we don't really understand what their relationship is to the virus itself. The virus does seem to trigger in-- in certain people rarely, but in certain people some kind of autoimmune type of phenomena where you get some persistent symptoms from the virus. And when you're infecting so many people with the virus, as we are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --even a small percentage of patients having some persistent symptoms ends up being a lot of people. And so there's more and more evidence of this. This syndrome hasn't been fully characterized, but there is-- I think there is enough evidence right now to suggest that there are people who are having long-term sequelae from the infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thank you, as always, for your insight. The airline industry is one of the hardest hit this year due to the coronavirus, and we want to go now to the CEO of American Airlines, Doug Parker, who joins us from Fort Worth, Texas. Good morning to you. DOUG PARKER (American Airlines CEO): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You announced Friday that you came to terms with the U.S. Treasury for a five and a half billion dollar loan. You could get another two billion if you need it. How long will this money last? And does it mean you won't have to carry out the nineteen thousand furloughs and job cuts you predict will happen this week? DOUG PARKER: Oh, yeah. Look, there's-- we have plenty of liquidity. This-- this-- that loan is part of the CARES Act from back in March. Some really important legislation, I think, for our country, certainly for our business, for the airline industry. It provided twenty-five billion dollars of loans to airlines. And that loan you're talking about is just the closing of our prorated share of that loan. But it also provided twenty-five billion dollars of payroll support, essentially a pass through-- a pass through to the airlines to pay our people, even though we didn't have full work for them to keep airlines moving, to keep the country moving. That's-- both of those things are really important. The loan program is complete. The payroll support program, unfortunately, expires on October 1st. Back in March, we all thought demand would be back. We wouldn't need support beyond this-- beyond this time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DOUG PARKER: Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. So on October 1st, that program, absent being extended, is going to expire. And indeed, they're going to be hundred thousand aviation professionals who are out of work, who wouldn't be otherwise. That is why we're fighting so hard to get that payroll support extended. MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear, your plan is still this week to lay off, or furlough, nineteen thousand people. DOUG PARKER: Our plan actually is to get Congress and the administration to come together and get the COVID relief package passed that in-- that will include support and an extension of payroll support program-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that is going to happen? DOUG PARKER: We do. There's enormous bipartisan support for it. We have Republicans, Democrats, the administration all saying-- but-- knowing that this is the right program, that it makes sense. That indeed it should be extended because airline employees provide critical infrastructure. And once we furlough those employees, it's really hard, for example, to get pilots back in training. So once-- once-- once we've furloughed-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DOUG PARKER: --and shrunk airlines, our ability to continue to provide services needed to pull the economy back out of this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  DOUG PARKER: --is going to be severely hampered. So, yeah, there's enormous support for it. You know, we have everyone putting us in every bill they have. We just need the bills to be laws. We need-- we need laws not bills. And that's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's-- that's-- DOUG PARKER: --that's what we're trying to-- that's what we're going to do. I'm-- I'm actually confident we can get it done. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm glad you're confident because hopes and as-- as-- as you're laying out there, I mean, Congress is just completely stalled on this. Did the White House give you an assurance that they will step in and give some kind of emergency aid to you if Congress can't deliver by September 30th? DOUG PARKER: The President said he's interested in-- in doing an executive order if it makes sense. We think the better plan is to get legislation passed between now and then. We really do believe it can happen. We're certainly-- there's certainly not much time left, but there's enough time. And again, in some-- oftentimes a deadline like this is what is needed to get action. We're hoping that's the case. We're letting everyone know that this is a real deadline. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DOUG PARKER: Indeed, a hundred thousand aviation professionals are going to be out of work come October 1st. If we don't get people to come together, we're really hopeful they can. Again, we've been told by all sides that they are supportive of this, that it makes complete sense that they're on our side. We just need them to work-- to come together and do what's best for America and for our country and certainly for the airline business. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you laid out, it was taxpayers back in the spring that gave the twenty-five billion to help you make payroll. The bet at the time was that the-- our health professionals would have everything under control by September 30th. And that is just clearly not the case. So-- DOUG PARKER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: What's-- I mean, how much money and for how long becomes the follow up question here, right? I mean, how do you get customers to fly again before there's a vaccine? DOUG PARKER: Well, we're seeing some increase in-- in as-- as customers begin to return to the skies, understanding that indeed it is safe to fly. We're seeing gradual improvement. The biggest thing-- so a vaccine certainly would be really helpful. But, you know, in between there, having quarantines go away, having, you know, having companies bring people back into the office, returning to work. Those types of things have a huge impact on the need for air travel. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DOUG PARKER: We've-- we saw, you know, at American we had our-- revenues were down some eighty-five percent in the second quarter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DOUG PARKER: They're going to be down about seventy-five percent in the third quarter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. DOUG PARKER: They're going to be down at about sixty-five percent in the fourth quarter. And that's better than most companies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DOUG PARKER: But it's still down sixty-five percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DOUG PARKER: So it's gradual return, but having-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. DOUG PARKER: --revenues down sixty-five percent nine months later is a big problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. I'm sorry. I'm out of time. I got to leave it there. Good luck to you, sir. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Georgia has gone Republican in the last seven elections. But this is 2020. CBS national correspondent Mark Strassmann reports. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Make Georgia vote Trump again, that's the President's struggle in a state reliably Republican no more. This Trump stump on Friday pitched Black voters. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. What the hell do you have to lose? MARK STRASSMANN: Nothing, Steven Stalker (ph) says. STEVEN STALKER: Democrats have never, ever done anything for us as a Black people. MARK STRASSMANN: Some Republicans strategists admit to win an election night, the President needs Georgia to wear a MAGA hat. Not this Georgia tech student. MAN #1: Biden at least appears to be making some effort to unite people. MARK STRASSMANN: According to our CBS News Battleground Tracker, Georgia is a toss-up, President Trump just one point ahead. The big issues in a state with a roughly even split among voters in both parties: COVID, the COVID economy, the Supreme Court, and a summer of unrest. WOMAN #1: We're not Democrats that are burning down cities. MARK STRASSMANN: For decades here, the late John Lewis thundered about the importance of voting. Turnout is critical for Joe Biden. On the front lines of Atlanta's suburbs and among the thirty percent of Georgia's registered voters, who are Black. MAN #2 (Biden Campaign Ad): Joe and Kamala uniquely understand. MARK STRASSMANN: This Biden campaign ad targets Black turnout. But in this Atlanta neighborhood, the motivation to get out to vote may be more about President Trump. WOMAN #2: I feel like-- WOMAN #3: I have to vote for Biden-- WOMAN #2: I feel like-- WOMAN #3: --just because we have to. MARK STRASSMANN: Why? WOMAN #3: To get Trump out. MARK STRASSMANN: Voters are only somewhat confident their votes will be counted correctly. More so Republicans than Democrats. WOMAN #2: In person, I didn't trust in the mail stuff. MARK STRASSMANN: A new lawsuit this weekend alleged security issues with voting machines. The third-party vendor is trying to fix it. In toss-up Georgia, this election is the most unsettled debate since sweet tea versus unsweet, in a state where a Democrat for president last won in 1992. Mark Strassmann, CBS News, Atlanta. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. The race is also close in nearby North Carolina, which has gone to Republicans the last two elections. Former Vice President Biden is currently up two points there, with forty-eight percent support. President Trump is at forty-six percent. Just how much of a factor is that Supreme Court battle becoming? CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is in Westchester County, New York, with more on his findings. Anthony, what have you found? ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Good morning, Margaret. Voters tell us they feel like it's raised the stakes in what was already a high-stakes election. One where many in these states tell us they feel like their culture and way of life is at stake. Let me show you this: A majority of voters in both these states feel like it's made the election even more important, especially Democrats feeling that way, but now both parties tell us that they are motivated to vote. Very high levels there. That's critical in an election that will probably all come down to turnout. But, let me remind everybody: Don't forget about the economy. It still outranks the court in many other issues in both of these states. Coronavirus also really important. And the reason that this is so critical, Margaret, is that the President has a lead on who would be better at handling the economy in both of these states, and in many others we've polled. In fact, across the board lately, we have seen a tightening of this race in state after state. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, we know Republicans also want to hold on to their Senate majority. Do we have any indication on whether the fates of these Republican senators in southern states are directly tied to the President's fortunes? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, some of it is, Margaret. Let me start in South Carolina, Republican, reliably Republican state, but here we find that incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham is in a very tight race with Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison. One reason is that while Republicans like the fact that he is close to the President, moderates and independents especially feeling like he agrees with Donald Trump too much. And it's a similar story in North Carolina, where incumbent Thom Tillis is down to Democrat Ta-- Cal Cunningham. Same story. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, given a record number of people are expected to vote by mail, will we know how this race is headed before November 3rd? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Some of it will be in the bank, as they say, because so much-- in fact, a majority of the votes will be cast before Election Day. If you look at two states here, starting with North Carolina, look at how many Democrats over Republicans say that they want to vote by mail or absentee, and then a sizeable number also are going to vote in person early. I suspect that when we get to Election Day, we'll be looking at whether or not Republicans can turn out in large numbers on Election Day maybe to make up that deficit. The fact is that they've done it before in the past, and they say they're going to do it again. But one other wrinkle in this, Margaret, is that Republicans say that they find navigating the voting process very easy in higher numbers than Democrats do, in a race where you're going to have different kinds of voting, that's going to be really important to what those turnout numbers ultimately become. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know, Anthony, you'll keep us honest on this complicated process this election year. Thank you very much. We'll be right back. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden's campaign announced Monday they\u00a0raised $80.8 million in May\u00a0along with the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committee.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports that it's the most the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has raised to date during the 2020 presidential election cycle. According to the campaign, more than half of the donors last month were new contributors, signaling a surge in grassroots momentum, with more than 1.5 million new supporters joining the campaign in the last few weeks. The campaign also said the number of online donors has tripled since February. The average online donation in May was $30 and educators continue to be listed as the largest occupation group for donors.\u00a0 \"I'm humbled and honored that you have put your trust in me as your presumptive Democratic nominee. And I'm incredibly honored by the support I've received from you all,\" Biden wrote in an email to supporters. This cash haul comes as the Biden campaign has been furiously playing fundraising catch-up with President Trump's campaign's powerhouse fundraising. In April, the Biden\u00a0campaign announced it and the DNC raised a combined $60.5 million, just behind the $61.7 million Mr. Trump and the RNC brought in that month. But the incumbent president maintained about a $100 million cash-on-hand advantage that month. \"Just a few months ago, people were ready to write this campaign off. Now, we are making huge dents in Donald Trump's war chest. Every single dollar is going to make sure he is only a one-term president,\" Biden wrote in Monday's email. \u00a0\"Let's keep up that pressure.\" Mr. Trump's campaign has not yet announced its cash haul for May. On Monday, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that the campaign had its single biggest online fundraising day ever the day before by bringing in $14 million to mark the president's birthday. That sum will show up in the second quarter totals.\u00a0 Presidential campaigns and parties face a monthly June 20 filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission. The second fundraising quarter ends on June 30.\u00a0 Meanwhile, ActBlue, which is used by Democrats and progressive groups to raise funds, announced it brought in $178 million through its platform in May. The cash haul came from 5.2 million contributions, making it the third largest month for the number of contributions and unique donors. The average May contribution was just $34. \u00a0According to ActBlue, Senate and House candidates raised $52 million using the platform in May, and twice as many people have given to Senate and House candidates last month as did in May 2018 before the midterm election. Congressional candidates face a second quarter filing with the FEC in mid-July. At the same time, State House and State Senate candidates also raised nearly double the amount of money in May as in April 2020 signaling a growing interest in down-ballot races. This comes as state legislatures are set to play a major role in redistricting following the 2020 census.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Biden called Monday's LGBTQ Supreme Court decision \"a momentous step forward for our country,\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. Heralded as the highest-level politician in 2012 to publicly support same-sex marriage,   Biden said in a statement that \"everyone should be able to live openly, proudly, as their true selves without fear.\" On the trail, Biden frequently spoke out about LGBTQ firings and has been critical of the Trump administration's policies related to LGBTQ Americans, as he did last week after some healthcare protections under the Affordable Care Act were rolled back for LGBTQ Americans. Regarding another social issue, the former VP was endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Monday. The abortion-rights group pressured Biden a year ago to reverse his support of the federal Hyde Amendment, which prevents tax payer dollars to be used for abortions. He switched that position then and today accepted the endorsement, pledging \"to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care, including reproductive health care.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP Ahead of his first rally in over three months, President Trump downplayed the risks of hosting tens of thousands of his supporters in an indoor arena on Saturday night in downtown Tulsa amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"Oklahoma's at a very low number. They've done really fantastic work,\" Mr. Trump told reporters following a roundtable on Monday afternoon. Mr. Trump spoke with Oklahoma Governor Stitt on Monday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. \"We have a 22,000 seat arena, but I think we're also going to take the convention hall next door and that's going to hold 40,000 so we'll have 22,000 plus 40,000 people.\" The location of the rally, the Bank of Oklahoma Arena, fits approximately 20,000 people, but according to their official website, the adjoining Cox Business Center accommodates just under 9,000.\u00a0 \"I can tell you on COVID or coronavirus, whatever you want to call it - plenty of names - tremendous progress is being made,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. This week, Oklahoma counts itself among over a dozen U.S. states battling spikes in new coronavirus cases. State officials on Monday reported 186 new cases of COVID-19, once again marking a new high in daily increases for both the state and Tulsa County. The Oklahoma State Department of Health have reported 1,653 confirmed coronavirus cases in Tulsa County since the pandemic broke out. According to\u00a0Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, each attendee at Mr. Trump's rally will receive a temperature check, hand sanitizer and mask before entry. Masks handed out to rally attendees will be optional, per a campaign spokesperson. The head of the Tulsa Health Department said he wishes an upcoming rally held by the Trump campaign would be postponed amid the surge in new coronavirus cases in the county. In an interview with Tulsa World, Dr. Bruce Dart, director of the Tulsa Health Department, said an indoor rally set to attract tens of thousands of Mr. Trump's supporters \"is a huge risk factor.\"\u00a0 Dart added that \"COVID is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently\u2026I wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn't as large a concern as it is today.\" It is remains unclear if the campaign will implement further social distancing measures both inside and outside the arena, with thousands of overflow expected. ELIZABETH WARREN Over 100 progressive leaders, activists, scholars and celebrities are urging Joe Biden to pick Senator Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says that in a letter to Biden, the groups outlined six arguments for Warren as VP, ranging from her policy ideas to her ability to explain complex government functions. \"Elizabeth Warren has proven herself most prepared to be president if the occasion arises and deeply expert on the overlapping emergencies now plaguing America \u2013 COVID-19, Economic Insecurity, Racial Injustice and Climate Change,\" the letter reads. It also argued that Warren is the best option to unite the party. Among the best-known signers are actors Jane Fonda and Alan Cumming, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and activist Ady Barkan. The letter also pushed back on the idea that Warren's Senate seat would be in jeopardy if she were chosen because Massachusetts has a Republican governor who would appoint her temporary successor. The letter accurately noted that the Democratic super majority in the state House and Senate there could, as it has in the past, vote to change the rule. The letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post, was provided to CBS News by former New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, who spearheaded the effort. He said that he did not speak with Warren or her team about the letter, but that he saw a need for her case to be made. \"She's a once in a generation talent,\" he said. \"But she's pretty humble. That's the Oklahoma side. She's not going to hustle for it, and some of the others will.\"\u00a0 Warren and a group of Democratic lawmakers on Monday introduced a bill to strengthen oversight of the federal government's pandemic response. The Coronavirus Oversight and Recovery Ethics (CORE) Act, which would require the president to inform Congress about the removal of any acting inspector general, comes after Mr. Trump fired or replaced nearly a half dozen watchdogs in April and May. Warren, along with Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Coons as well as Representatives Pramila Jayapal and John Sarbanes, proposed a draft of the bill last month, but officially introduced it Monday with 26 Democratic Members of Congress joining as co-sponsors. The bill would expand the authority of the Congressional Oversight Commission to include the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program and give the Commission subpoena power. It would also require White House task force members working on pandemic aid to disclose their financial interests and ban companies receiving pandemic aid from spending money on lobbying for at least a year. \"Congress must pass our bill in the next relief package to hold the Trump administration \u00a0accountable as they hand out trillions of dollars in response to the COVID-19 crisis,\" Warren said in a statement. The bill would also hold senior executives at companies receiving pandemic aid personally liable if they fail to meet employment requirement LGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that it is illegal for an employer to fire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, delivering a major victory in the fight for civil rights for LGBTQ people,\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn\u00a0reports. The court's 6-3 ruling extends the scope of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion, to include LGBTQ people. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored the majority's opinion, joined the liberal wing of the bench in ruling that \"an employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII.\" Gorsuch wrote, \"Judges are not free to overlook plain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations.\"\u00a0 He continued, \"In Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee's sex when deciding to fire that employee. We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.\"Mr. Trump called the ruling, \"very powerful\" at the White House, Monday afternoon,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. \"We live with the decision of the Supreme Court,\" Mr. Trump said, later adding, \"They have so ruled.\" IN THE HOUSE NEW YORK The state's 16th district is slated to be the most competitive primary to watch next Tuesday. Progressive Jamaal Bowman is looking to unseat 31-year-incumbent Eliot Engel and picked up the endorsement of California Congresswoman Katie Porter on Monday. \u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports\u00a0the campaign also announced they'd raised more than $750,000 in the month of June alone. Engel, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has picked up more Democrat establishment support, with endorsements from Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressmen Adam Schiff of California and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\u00a0 VIRGINIA After an unorthodox drive-thru convention on Saturday, ex-Liberty University employee Bob Good has claimed victory against Congressman Denver Riggleman, winning 58% of the approximately 2,537 delegates who voted in the adapted drive-thru convention vote on Saturday. Pending a challenge to the results from Riggleman, he would be the third House incumbent to be unseated in a primary this cycle. The other two are Dan Lipinski of Illinois and Steve King of Iowa. Saturday's convention was held in the parking lot of Tree of Life Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, near Good's home, where registered delegates voted in their cars. Riggleman, a Republican freshman who faced scrutiny from some local Republicans for officiating a gay wedding, claimed ballot irregularities as the results were being calculated. \"At some point, we really have to look at how these votes were actually counted and what the processes were,\" Riggleman told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0in his first interview since Saturday. \"For only 2,500 people to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people like this is really egregious.\" In response to Riggleman's claim, Good said when results were called, \"That's what losers say.\" Riggleman said he's still weighing his option on whether to challenge the results and claimed Good paid committee members to push for a convention rather than a primary. Democrats anticipated a Good win to make this seat, which Trump won by double digits, more competitive. Good is seen as a poor fundraiser and a more polarizing social conservative that Democrats could campaign against, and four Democrats will have a primary for this seat on June 23: entrepreneur and past 2018 primary candidate R.D. Huffstetler, local school board member John Lesinski, veteran Claire Russo and healthy policy instructor at the University of Virginia Cameron Webb. The last Democrat to win this seat was Tom S.P. Perriello in 2008.\u00a0 IN THE SENATE GEORGIA One Democratic candidate running in Georgia's special senate election is receiving national attention. Reverend Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Atlanta's famous Ebenezer Baptist Church (the church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was once the pastor), received endorsements from five sitting U.S. senators and former presidential candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\u00a0 Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Michael Bennet all announced their support for Warnock, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. In a statement Warnock praised the senators for their leadership and support and said, \"I look forward to joining them in the United States Senate and continuing my service to Georgians and working people.\" Warnock is currently in a crowded special election race for the Senate seat currently held by Senator Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler also faces a Republican primary opponent in her race, Congressman Doug Collins. The special election date is set for November 3 with a potential runoff scheduled for January 5, 2021. KENTUCKY Early in-person voting has started this week in Kentucky for the state's primary next Tuesday, and one contest to watch will be the Democratic Senate primary for who will take on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in November, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath has led the field in fundraising, but in recent weeks Kentucky State Representative Charles Booker has earned the endorsements of the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. McGrath has been criticized in ads from both sides for either being too Democratic or too pro-Trump. Booker's campaign released an ad called \"Real Democrat\" in which he promises to fight for real change. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed McGrath and many of the former presidential candidates like Senators\u00a0Warren and\u00a0Harris supported McGrath when she initially launched her Senate campaign last summer.

            "article_content": "Congressman John Lewis spent much of his life fighting for voting rights and was a champion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It established federal oversight of election laws in states with a history of racial discrimination, but the Supreme Court struck down key sections of the legislation in 2013. Lewis had been pushing to restore parts of the law ever since. The original act passed in part because of his march in Selma, Alabama \u2014 the scene of violence against Black protesters demanding voting rights horrified Americans. Months later, Lewis was there when President Lyndon Johnson signed the act into law. \"The president of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, members of the House and Senate, and the American people heard our cries and responded to our pain and to our suffering,\" Lewis said in 2019. The Voting Rights Act was renewed several times, most recently in 2006 with bipartisan support. But in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated federal oversight of elections, a key part of the law designed to keep tabs over states with a history of discriminating against minority voters. The court decided such oversight was no longer necessary because of changes made by states since 1965. Lewis strongly disagreed and became the lead advocate for fully restoring the law. \"They're saying, in effect, that history cannot repeat itself. But I say, come and walk in my shoes,\" he said in 2013. Vanita Gupta, the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a group Lewis worked with to restore the act, told CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe the Supreme Court's 2013 decision \"devastated the voting rights movement.\" \"Voter suppression is alive and well in the United States of America in 2020,\" she said. \"So today, when you see on the news these long, long lines, why do those long lines exist and why do they only exist in predominantly Black and Brown communities?\" But Senate Republicans have refused to take up the issue of voting rights, arguing states should be left to run their own elections. Just last week, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the Wall Street Journal, \"There's very little tangible evidence of this whole voter-suppression nonsense that the Democrats are promoting.\" Now, Congressional Democrats say they will be stepping up pressure on Republicans. \"The best thing that Senate Republicans can do to honor the legacy, service, sacrifice and sincerity of Congressman Lewis is to pass that Voting Rights Act bill,\" said Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries and other colleagues say that if or when parts of the Voting Rights Act are restored, it should be renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. But the realities of Washington today are such that unless Democrats have full control, passage of that legislation is unlikely anytime soon.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday that she was \"satisfied\" with the response of Joe Biden's presidential campaign to allegations of sexual assault against him, according to\u00a0CBS news campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0CBSNews.com political reporter Grace Segers.\u00a0 The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has been accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault by a former Senate staffer, Tara Reade. Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, although Biden himself has not directly addressed them. \"I do support Joe Biden. I'm satisfied with how he has responded,\" Pelosi said in an interview with CNN's \"New Day.\"\u00a0 She\u00a0announced her endorsement\u00a0of Biden on Monday. CNN pressed Pelosi on Biden's own public silence so far in the face of the allegations. \"You know, it's a matter that he has to deal with, but I am impressed with the people who work for him saying that they absolutely never heard one iota of information about this. Nobody ever brought forth a claim or had anybody else tell them about such a claim,\" Pelosi replied. Pelosi reiterated her support for Biden in her weekly press conference Thursday, saying that she has \"complete respect for the Me Too movement,\" but that she also believes in due process. There is \"due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe\u00a0Biden,\" Pelosi told reporters, noting that his Senate staff had been interviewed, and there was no record of Reade's accusation.\u00a0 Republicans have been calling on the release of Biden's Senate records, in the belief that an official complaint from Reade will be in there. \"I have a great comfort level with the situation as I see it,\" Pelosi said. Meanwhile the Republican House campaign arm kept inboxes full on Thursday, using the sexual assault allegations against Biden to call out targeted House Democrats and candidates. In almost 30 email blasts, the National Republican Congressional Committee bring up a lack of input from a lawmaker on the issue, or past comments about sexual assault during the heat of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.\u00a0 \"A lot of them went on the record demanding survivors be heard, demanding survivors be given a safe place to voice their traumatic issues that have happened to them,\" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Michael McAdams told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"And now they are turning a blind eye to that and completely going back on what they said because the person that the allegations are against is a Democrat.\"\u00a0 Like other Democrats, Congresswoman Dina Titus, one of Biden's earlier endorsers, told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0she didn't think the allegations would have an impact on down-ballot races. \"I'm a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement, every woman needs to tell her story and have it vetted. I believe it's been thoroughly vetted... and all you have to do is look at his record on Violence Against Women, the other things, to show where he stands on this,\" she said. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN CBS News has spoken with Tara Reade several times since she publicized her allegation against Joe Biden on March 25. Since that time, Biden over the past 36 days has not directly addressed Reade's claim,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. While his campaign has called the allegation \"untrue,\" Biden has yet to respond directly.\u00a0 Tonight,\u00a0MSNBC announced\u00a0that Biden himself would respond to the sexual assault allegation for the first time on \"Morning Joe\" on Friday morning. Biden's lack of response has also left other high-profile Democrats in a tough and frustrating spot, several Democratic operatives tell CBS News. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, along with Stacey Abrams, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer have all been asked in interviews about the allegation, but Biden's recent sparse schedule of interviews has not afforded many opportunities to ask him directly.\u00a0 His team for the past two weeks has prioritized local interviews and the campaign has not held a virtual press conference with his usual traveling press corps since April 2. For some Democratic operatives, the focus on the allegation \u2014 and Biden's silence \u2014 is overshadowing his campaign messaging. Regarding the new unemployment numbers today, Biden said in a statement: \"Outrageous? Yes. Surprising? No. These are the latest damning signs of Donald Trump's manifest incompetence.\"\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP The Trump campaign will kick off its first\u00a0television advertising blitz\u00a0of the 2020 campaign cycle Sunday with a seven-day, seven-figure buy focused on the president's response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to campaign officials.\u00a0 A spokesperson called the new advertising campaign \"an inspirational message about the unyielding resolve of Americans\" that \"heralds the great American comeback.\" The advertising campaign represents a departure from more recent attack ads targeting Biden's relationship with China. However, allies to the president tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0that Mr. Trump's re-election efforts will plan to unveil sharper attacks on Biden's \"weak\" stance toward China in the coming weeks.\u00a0 A slew of public polls show the president trailing Biden in battleground states Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, key to Mr. Trump's 2016 electoral win over Hillary Clinton. President Trump dismissed the polling Wednesday night, in an interview with Reuters. \"I don't believe the polls,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I believe the people of this country are smart. And I don't think that they will put a man in who's incompetent.\" President Trump also\u00a0announced Wednesday\u00a0that he planned to travel to Arizona, his first venture outside of Washington since seeing off a hospital ship in Virginia\u00a0more than a month ago, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. While the president sounded hopeful that \"in the not-too-distant-future\" he could return to \"massive rallies,\" no events have been announced outside of\u00a0a stop next week\u00a0at a Honeywell facility\u00a0now producing face masks. The trip will mark the president's\u00a0second visit to Arizona\u00a0this year, a swing state that delivered Trump a\u00a0nearly four-point win\u00a0in 2016.\u00a0 However, early general election polls show Joe Biden leading\u00a0by nearly 10 points\u00a0in the state. And down ballot in Arizona, Democrat Mark Kelly has raised more money than\u00a0any other Senate candidate this cycle\u00a0in his challenge to GOP Senator Martha McSally. \"First of all, I want to say the president's always welcome in Arizona,\" the state's Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said at\u00a0a press conference Wednesday. Asked if authorities would intervene, if Trump's visit drew a crowd of supporters, Ducey added, \"I'm asking people to stay home, stay healthy, and stay connected.\" VEEPSTAKES KAMALA HARRIS Today, the California Senator announced the \"COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act,\" one of several pieces of legislation Harris has introduced amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\u00a0 The task force would bring together health care experts and leaders from all levels of government to confront the racial and ethnic disparities arising from the outbreak.\u00a0 This would also include providing weekly data on patient outcomes disaggregated by race and ethnicity.\u00a0 The bill would also report to Congress the structural inequalities preceding the pandemic and the effect those disparities had on the disproportionate rates of infection. Harris is also calling for a permanent Infectious Disease Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task force after COVID-19 to continue to identify and address any disparities.\u00a0 \"People of color are being infected and dying from coronavirus at astounding rates,\" Harris said in a statement. \"The COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act is a necessary step to fully understand the impact of this virus in the hardest hit communities, and make targeted investments that correspond with their unique needs.\"\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports that legislation introduced by Harris in March,\u00a0The Pandemic Disaster Assistance Act, will be introduced in the House. This plan would expand the ability for FEMA to provide financial assistance to individuals during a pandemic and not just during natural disasters. ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jan Schakowsky on Thursday proposed legislation that would create a government office tasked with preventing shortages of protective equipment, prescription drugs and medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the proposal, a newly formed Emergency Office of Manufacturing for Public Health would be be required to manufacture or contract the manufacturing of products, drugs and medical devices in shortage within a month of the bill's passage. \"We need to radically increase our supply of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to attack the coronavirus crisis head-on. We have an Administration that is failing to lead and failing to ensure health care providers and patients have the resources they need,\" Warren said. The bill has the support of several progressive and medical groups, including the Center for American Progress and Doctors for America, but similar proposals from Warren and Schakowsky in the past have failed to gain traction.\u00a0 GRETCHEN WHITMER Republicans in the Michigan House of Representatives took additional steps to limit Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer's executive emergency powers on Thursday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0Jack Turman. The House also did not extend Michigan's state of emergency, which is set to expire at the end of the day.\u00a0 The House passed a resolution that allows Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield to take legal action against Whitmer and the actions she has taken during the coronavirus pandemic. Whitmer has argued that she does not need the legislature's approval to extend a state of emergency. But Whitmer has indicated that she would like to partner with the legislature to extend the state of emergency in order to provide liability protections for health care workers and first responders.\u00a0 Protesters gathered at the State Capitol in Lansing to voice frustrations about the extension of emergency powers. Democratic State Senator Dayna Polehanki, who\u00a0tweeted a photo\u00a0of armed protesters in the Senate gallery, told CBS News that half of the gathering looked like a Trump rally and the other half expressed concern about Whitmer's stay at home order. The differences between the governor and the legislature over executive emergency powers have been simmering over the past week. Last Friday, the state senate passed two bills that would limit Whitmer's emergency powers. Whitmer threatened to veto any legislation that would take authority away from her or future governors, arguing that executive emergency powers are essential during a crisis. The dispute reached a low point on Wednesday as emails between Whitmer's staff and state Senate Majority Mike Shirkey's staff showed that Republican legislators proposed two one-week extensions to Whitmer's emergency powers in exchange for a public agreement that future stay at home orders will require legislative approval. Whitmer's staff responded with a message from the governor, saying, \"I cannot abrogate my duty to act in an emergency to protect the lives of Michiganders.\" CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE In special election news, Democrat Tricia Zunker, running in Wisconsin's 7th District, was recently endorsed by\u00a0Senator Cory Booker\u00a0and\u00a0EMILY's List. In California's 25th District for Katie Hill's former seat, Hill herself has gotten involved in the race through her PAC. In an\u00a0ad shot\u00a0in front of the White House, Hill encouraged people to return their mail ballots, saying, \"We've seen when we take our vote for granted, we put ourselves and our communities in danger.\"\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says both districts have their special elections on May 12, though California has switched to an all-mail ballot election.\u00a0 ISSUES THAT MATTER EQUAL RIGHTS The Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee on Thursday released a report arguing that \"COVID-19 has amplified existing inequalities and discrimination that have impacted communities of color.\" In the report,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says DPCC Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cite data showing a disproportionate number of coronavirus cases and deaths in people of color.\u00a0 The report outlined several measures Democrats hope to be included in future coronavirus legislation, including guaranteed equitable access to testing across communities, emergency rental assistance and an increase in Paycheck Protection Program access. In addition to releasing demographic breakdowns for COVID-19 testing, the report calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a commission to study inequalities in coronavirus cases and testing.\u00a0 \"We must do more to help communities of color weather this storm,\" Schumer told reporters over the phone. \"This pandemic has heightened many of the terrible health care and economic disparities that communities of color have unfortunately faced for generations.\"\u00a0 JOBS More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance due to the coronavirus pandemic, including another 3.8 million Americans who filed claims last week, according to the Labor Department. Since businesses began to close to slow the spread of the virus six weeks ago, 30.3 million Americans have filed claims. But the number is likely higher because many people have struggled to file unemployment insurance as systems have been bogged down by the staggering number of claims.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says a survey from the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute\u00a0found that for every ten people who successfully filed for benefits, another five to six either could not get through to make a claim or didn't try because it was too difficult to do so.\u00a0 \"Millions of the newly jobless are going without benefits as the unemployment system buckles under the weight of new claims,\" EPI economists Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould wrote. Thursday's Labor Department report also showed that 12.4% of American workers were receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending April 18. Before the pandemic, the highest weekly percentage recorded was 7% back in 1975. The peak during the Great Recession was 5% during two different weeks in May and June of 2009. COST OF VOTING A new report from the\u00a0Brennan Center for Justice\u00a0says the $400 million Congress passed in March to help states cover election costs due to coronavirus is likely far short of what's needed.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says the report examined election costs in five states with different systems: Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. It found that election administration costs from COVID-19 in those five states alone could cost at least $414 million. The Congressional grants could cover less than 10% of what Georgia officials need and about 18% of what officials in Ohio need, according to the report.\u00a0 The bulk of costs are expected to fall on local officials, rather than state governments, the report found. In Ohio and Missouri, local officials are expected to cover more than 90% of the election costs.\u00a0 \"Facing an economic downturn, states may soon tighten their belts further on many services,\" the report says. \"The federal government has the resources to ensure that state and local governments can run free, fair, and safe elections this fall. We urge them to do so as soon as possible.\" \u00a0 The Brennan Center\u00a0previously\u00a0estimated it could cost $2 billion to secure the November election due to coronavirus, but has since said it may cost double that to secure all other elections scheduled this year.\u00a0 STATE-BY-STATE CALIFORNIA The California Republican Party has filed suit against Governor Gavin Newsom to prohibit the practice of ballot collecting or \"ballot harvesting\" during two upcoming special elections in the state, arguing it stands \"in direct conflict\" with social distancing guidelines and Newsom's shelter-in-place mandate to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0 Two weeks ago California Republican Party chairwoman\u00a0Jessica Patterson\u00a0sent Newsom a letter asking him to halt the practice and clarify that his order \"prohibits collection of ballots,\" but she said Newsom did not respond. \"The governor has dodged his responsibility,\" Patterson told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. \"We're hoping the courts will compel him to clarify,\" she added. Newsom's office declined to comment for this story. Ballot harvesting allows party volunteers or campaign workers to collect mail-in ballots from voters and submit them in groups to polling places or election offices. In 2016, California\u00a0expanded the law\u00a0to allow any person to collect a mail-in ballot. Prior law restricted the practice to just relatives of those or those living in the same household as the voter. \u00a0 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who is also named in the lawsuit and is currently pushing for a 50-state, vote-by-mail plan ahead of the November presidential election, told CBS News \"this whole debate is nothing but a pretext that Republicans use to advance their voter suppression agenda.\" Padilla acknowledged, \"Yes, there are numerous public health directives in place\u2026But at the same time, there are fundamental voting rights that are in place and must be protected. There is no conflict. People can reach out to voters and people can exercise multiple ways of voting, while respecting public health directives.\" Patterson argued that voters \"aren't leaving their ballots on the front steps,\" and that the practice of ballot harvesting \"requires an in-person hand off.\" She added \"that would absolutely violate social distancing if someone is coming to your house, and picking up that ballot from you, and you're signing it over to them.\" Wednesday's lawsuit specifically points to upcoming special elections on May 12 in California's 25th Congressional District and the 28th state Senate District. The congressional race for the 25th District is to replace Democrat\u00a0Katie Hill\u00a0who resigned after a sex scandal and a congressional ethics investigation.\u00a0 Christy Smith, a Democratic state assemblywoman, is running against former U.S. Navy fighter pilot and Republican businessman Mike Garcia.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Smith's campaign told CBS News that \"due to public health concerns, we are not collecting ballots from supporters at this time.\" \u00a0Garcia's campaign, who has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CBS News, was involved in ballot harvesting efforts, including recruiting volunteers and encouraging voters to organize ballot harvesting drives at their churches as late as April 10, according to emails sent by Garcia's campaign manager and obtained by CBS News. On April 11, California's stay-at-home order was extended into May, and days later Patterson officially sent her letter to Newsom asking for clarification.\u00a0 A GOP official told CBS News \"a big part of it is you have to prepare.\" The official added \"you have to prepare for what's coming and whether or it's going to be extended.\" Garcia's campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When asked if the National Republican Congressional Committee is okay with Garcia's campaign focusing on ballot harvesting efforts despite calls from party leaders to halt the practice, NRCC Spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair passed along contact information for Newsom's press office and said \"we will give you an answer just as soon as you get an answer from Governor Newsom on if this is illegal or not.\" Patterson said the California Republican Party has currently halted all ballot harvesting efforts and \"following the stay-at-home orders.\" NORTH CAROLINA The federal independent coalition Organizing Together 2020, virtually launched the North Carolina arm of its campaign during a Zoom call Wednesday evening, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. \u00a0With more than 250 attendees on the call,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that nearly three dozen staffers joined hundreds of participants to hear speeches and organization plans for the newly-formed group, Organizing Together North Carolina.\u00a0 The group, which has just shy of 100 staffers, was created in part to begin organizing in North Carolina cities ahead of the general election. In the months ahead of the November election, volunteers and organizers will get to know the different communities and identify the community leaders throughout the state.\u00a0 Paul Tewes, who led the 2008 Iowa campaign for president Obama is a co-founder of Organizing Together 2020. He told the group in his opening remarks on the Zoom call that they all share a common mission: \"We don't like this guy in the White House and we got to get him out.\" Tewes also acknowledged the novelty of organizing amid the COVID-19 outbreak. \"I don't know when the normal hits. I don't think anybody does. But there's a new normal and you're going to be organizing and learning new skills and teaching people down the road the new skills you're picking up because we're organizing in a different time now,\" said Tewes. \"I have a feeling, at least some semblance of this is going to be around through the general election. So, you know what you're doing now and learning now and teaching now is going to be hugely important as we get closer to November.\" Organizing Together 2020 also has coalitions in five other battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A handful of labor unions and progressive organizations have partnered with Organizing Together North Carolina including the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, People for the American Way, and the North Carolina chapter of the National Associated for the Advancement of Colored People.\u00a0 \"Collaborating with Organizing Together North Carolina will be crucial to expanding our voter mobilization efforts statewide and building capacity for this upcoming election cycle,\" said North Carolina NAACP President and co-chair for Organizing Together North Carolina, Rev. Dr. T. Anthony Spearman in an emailed statement. \"Our jacked-up democratic system has allowed gerrymandering and voter suppression to disenfranchise North Carolinians. Together, we can amplify the voices of the vulnerable and fight for a progressive agenda that will move us all forward.\" DELEGATE SITUATIONS LET'S MAKE A DEAL The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have reached a deal to allow Bernie Sanders to fill state-wide delegate slots for the convention even though the rules of the party state these delegates only go to active campaigns, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. According to the rule of the party, at-large and pledged elected official delegates from a state are allocated to candidates whose campaigns are still active at the time of the state convention, and Sanders suspended his campaign before any state conventions took place.\u00a0 With the deal, at-large and PLEO Delegate slots will be filled by supporters of the Biden and Sanders campaigns based on the candidates' respective statewide results. In a press released Thursday morning, the Biden campaign said, \"While Senator Sanders is no longer actively seeking the nomination, the Biden campaign feels strongly that it is in the best interest of the party and the effort to defeat Donald Trump in November to come to an agreement regarding these issues that will ensure representation of Sanders supporters and delegate candidates, both on the floor and in committees.\"\u00a0 The memo from the campaign also says that if New York follows through on not holding a presidential primary, the Biden campaign will ensure Sanders' supporters are represented in some way in the New York delegation at the national convention.",

            "article_content": "Voters say\u00a0the Supreme Court vacancy has added to the already high  stakes of the presidential election.\u00a0 In the battlegrounds of Georgia and North Carolina, most say  it makes the election feel even more important \u2014 it's one more factor in an election in which most voters from both parties think their culture and way of life are at stake.\u00a0 President Trump's voters here think the Democrats want society to change too fast, and Joe Biden's voters think Republicans  want to go back to the past. The court fight may not be changing votes, since most were already locked in, but many describe it as adding even more motivation to the race. Both sides are about equally likely to say they'll vote (and some already have).  In two contests that will turn almost entirely on turnout, that's essential.\u00a0 And as important as the Supreme Court is, voters tell us it is just one of  the major topics on their minds. Issues of race continue to split voters in these fast-growing, changing Southern states, and views on the protests are a major factor, too. The Black voters who make up sizable shares of the electorate here voice agreement  with the Black Lives Matter movement, as do White Democrats, but the president's supporters say too much attention  is being paid to discrimination against Black people today.\u00a0 And it all adds up to a razor-thin horse race: Georgia remains a toss-up, with Mr. Trump up just a point; it favored Biden by a point this summer. North Carolina sees Biden up two; he had a four-point edge this summer.\u00a0 In each state the president has consolidated support, maintains leads with non-college White voters and men, and  is seen as better on the economy. Biden's support remains steady, bolstered by performing well with women and Black voters, and by improving on Democrats' 2016 performance among White women with college degrees.\u00a0 It's a pattern across all the states we've been polling of late as we head into the first debate: Biden has not added to the big leads he had all summer, and things show a general, if slight, tightening toward the president's way overall. Mr. Trump is up comfortably in neighboring South Carolina, but  that state offers some real Senate drama of its own. Amid protests from Democratic leaders citing 2016 precedent, Republican  voters think Mr. Trump should pick the next justice, and when asked why, they choose as the top reason, \"a sitting president's nominee should always get a vote.\" Republicans also overwhelmingly say the Senate should hold a vote on Mr. Trump's nominee before the  election.\u00a0 And about half of voters in these states say they are now more motivated  to vote because of the high court vacancy, but both sides had been intending to vote already, and some already have. Biden and Mr. Trump are running neck-and-neck in these states among voters who say the court is a major factor in their decision. Still, as Senate Democrats face decisions on how to approach things  from here, most voters say the Democrats should consider the nominee on the merits. (The poll was taken before Judge Amy Coney Barrett was named and did not name any specific nominee.) But Democrats' own voters want them to do everything they can to stop  it. When it comes to some of the issues being discussed amid the Supreme Court  debate, in North Carolina, a majority \u2014 55% of likely voters \u2014 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while only 16% say it should be illegal in all cases. A majority approve of the Affordable Care Act, and 75% say health insurance companies should  be required to cover preexisting conditions at the same rates as everyone else.\u00a0 And don't forget the economy. It still outranks the court as a major  factor in vote, largely because it's one thing both parties both agree on as important. (By contrast, Republicans are comparably less concerned about the coronavirus.) Mr. Trump enjoys an advantage on the economy here, as he does in other battleground states. Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina all have Republican senators  up for reelection this year, and Senate control may hinge on these races. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the group is in South Carolina, a reliably Republican state where Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison has pulled almost even with incumbent Republican  Lindsey Graham. We find Graham just a point up, with more South Carolina voters saying he agrees with Mr. Trump too much, rather than the right amount. How Graham handles the confirmation hearings appears to be a wash  for him, with nearly half saying it won't affect their Senate vote if he votes for the nominee. The rest divided on partisan lines. North Carolina presents the Democrats with a pickup opportunity,  with challenger Cal Cunningham still leading Senator Thom Tillis by a wide margin in a race that hasn't changed since the summer. The president, in a tight race of his own here, again looks to be a factor. More North Carolinians think Tillis agrees with Mr. Trump  too much, rather than the right amount.\u00a0 A Tillis vote for Mr. Trump's nominee would please most Republicans and looks  like a slight net-negative among independents in North Carolina. Of the three states we polled this week, Senate Republicans' best  prospects of holding a seat are currently in Georgia, where incumbent David Perdue leads challenger Jon Ossoff by five points. In these states, where Black voters make up large shares of the electorate,  race and partisanship mark sharp divisions in how voters view the protests about police treatment of African Americans.\u00a0 Most Black voters here \u2014 as they do nationwide \u2014 strongly agree with  the ideas of the Black Lives Matter movement and think too little attention is being paid to issues of racial discrimination against Black people.\u00a0 Among White voters in these states, partisanship defines differences.  Most White Democrats agree with Black voters on these issues, but most White Republicans think that too much attention  is being paid to the issue of racial discrimination against Black people, and feel that Joe Biden, as a candidate, pays too much attention to the needs and concerns of Black people, and too little to those of White people.\u00a0 By contrast, about half of White Republicans think more attention  needs to be paid to issues of discrimination against White people.\u00a0 Black voters think Donald Trump is paying too much attention to the  needs and problems of White people and too little to those of Black people. (In contrast, they see Joe Biden as paying the right amount of attention to both groups.)\u00a0 We see a similar racial divide over how the candidates are handling  the recent protests about the treatment of African Americans by police. Most Black voters, as well as most White Democratic voters, approve of Biden's handling of the protests and strongly disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling them. Most White Republicans  strongly approve of Mr. Trump and strongly disapprove of Biden. Most likely voters in Georgia and North Carolina say the protests  will be a major factor in their vote, though it trails the economy in importance. White voters and Black voters factor in the protests in about equal measure, though an electoral connection exists only among White voters. White voters say the protests are  a major factor and overwhelmingly back Mr. Trump's reelection. White voters for whom the protests are less of a factor are more evenly split between Mr. Trump and Biden. (Black voters overwhelmingly support Biden, regardless of the importance they place on protests.) We see a divide among White voters by gender and education on how  Mr. Trump is handling the protests, particularly in North Carolina. Most White voters without a college degree \u2014 in particular men \u2014 approve of the president's approach to the protests. Among White voters with college degrees, we see a gender divide: Men tend to approve of the president's approach, while women tend to disapprove. One thing that cuts across party lines is that most voters, Black  and White, don't think that it is likely that large violent demonstrations accompanied by rioting and looting will come to their town, not even in the suburbs. In Georgia, less than a third say this is even somewhat likely. A big part of that turnout equation: Most of the vote in Georgia  and North Carolina battlegrounds will be cast before November 3.\u00a0 Democrats plan to vote by mail or vote early. As of now, the in-person  vote in North Carolina looks like it will be more Republican, putting pressure on them to turn out, but we've certainly seen that happen in North Carolina in prior years. In both states, Republicans say they find the voting process overall  easier than Democrats do. In North Carolina, seven in 10 Republicans call it very easy, versus four in 10 Democrats who describe it that way. And in Georgia, Republicans calling it very easy outnumber Democrats by 2 to 1. That'll be something to watch  closely as voters navigate their options over the next couple of weeks. And amid all the heated discussion over how to vote and voting methods,  voters are somewhat, if not very, confident that their votes will be counted properly. Democrats are less confident than Republicans. These surveys were conducted  on behalf of CBS News by YouGov between September 22-25, 2020. They are based on representative samples of 1,164 registered voters in Georgia, 1,213 in North Carolina, and 1,080 in South Carolina. Margins of error for registered voters are +/- 3.3 points in  Georgia, +/- 3.6 points in North Carolina, and +/- 3.8 points in South Carolina. Toplines: Georgia North Carolina South Carolina",

            "article_content": "With fewer than 40 days left before the election, President Donald Trump unveiled his second policy plan in as many days as he tried to chip away at his Democratic rival's support among Black and Hispanic voters and in key battleground states.\u00a0At a \"Black Voices for Trump\" event in Atlanta, Georgia, Trump announced what his campaign dubbed a \"Platinum Plan\" laying out his \"promise to Black America\" if he wins a second term, including a push for economic development and loan money and a pledge to designate Juneteenth as a federal holiday. Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, is so named because June 19, 1865, is when slaves were freed in Galveston, Texas.\u00a0The announcement came during a two-day campaign swing that ticked off a long list of boxes, both geographically and with key constituencies.\u00a0He unveiled what aides termed a \"vision\" for health care in North Carolina, where polls show him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden effectively tied. He held a rally in Jacksonville, Florida, one of the most hotly contested battleground states. He courted Hispanic voters near Miami and Black voters in Atlanta. And he held another rally Friday night in Newport News, Virginia. Biden is well ahead of Trump in Virginia, but the location is close to key North Carolina counties that are difficult for the president to visit, according to the campaign, because not all airports can accommodate Air Force One and its landing requirements.\u00a0Trump has tried to contrast his jam-packed schedule with Biden's, who has made just 12 visits outside of Delaware since his August 11 selection of California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, worrying some Democrats with his low-key approach.\u00a0Trump complained in Atlanta that Biden \"never goes out!\" and said losing the November 3 election would sting even worse if he lost to a man who never campaigns.\u00a0Trump also made rare references to the recent killings of Black men and women at the hands of police, which have sparked massive protests across the nation. Trump said the nation grieves for the \"senseless\" deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, while continuing to lash out at demonstrators.\u00a0\"Our hearts break for their families and for all families who have lost a loved one. ... But we can never allow mob rule,\" he said, denouncing the Black Lives Matter movement. \"This is an unusual name for an organization whose ideology and tactics are right now destroying many Black lives,\" Trump charged.\u00a0The plan unveiled Friday included a long list of promises, with few details on how they would be paid for or fulfilled.\u00a0\"If you vote Republican over the next four years, we will create three million new jobs for the Black community, open 500,000 new black-owned businesses, increase access to capital in Black communities by $500 billion,\" he said. The plan also calls for expanding opportunity zones, designating the Ku Klux Klan and antifa as terrorist organizations and creating a national clemency project to \"right wrongful prosecutions and to pardon individuals who have reformed.\"\u00a0Trump claimed that Democrats like Biden have taken Black voters \"for granted.\"\u00a0\"He doesn't know Black Americans like I do,\" Trump added.\u00a0\u00a0Biden issued a statement before Trump spoke.\u00a0\"As president, I will work to advance racial equity across the American economy and build back better,\" he said. \"I promise to fight for Black working families and direct real investments to advance racial equity as part of our nation's economic recovery.\"\u00a0Biden also pointed to the nearly 6,800 Georgians who have died of the coronavirus, which has disproportionately impacted Black and Hispanic communities, as well as Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0On Thursday, Trump unveiled a health care \"vision\" more than three-and-a-half years into his presidency and signed an executive order that included a pledge to protect people with preexisting medical conditions from insurance discrimination \u2014 even though that right is already guaranteed in the Obama-era health law his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn.\u00a0In Virginia on Friday, he said he would extend a moratorium on offshore drilling to the Virginia and North Carolina coasts. But then he told the rally crowd, \"If you want to have oil rigs out there, just let me know, we'll take it off.\"\u00a0Trump has been campaigning with little regard for the virus, which has now killed more than 200,000 people in the United States. At the Atlanta event, there was no effort at social distancing, even though nearly half of the ballroom where the event was held was empty. His rally in Newport News on Friday night drew thousands of supporters despite rainy weather most of the day; most did not wear masks. \u00a0On Friday morning, at his golf club in Doral, Florida, Trump tried to blunt Biden's support among Hispanic voters at a \"Latinos for Trump\" roundtable. Trump's campaign is increasingly confident that his support is growing with the demographic, including in Florida, one of the most competitive 2020 battlegrounds, where elections are often won by a single percentage point.\u00a0An NBC-Marist poll of Florida voters released earlier this month found Latinos in the state about evenly divided between Biden and Trump \u2014 a major change from the same poll in 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton led Trump by a 59% to 36% margin. But a Monmouth University poll also conducted this month found Biden well ahead of Trump among Latino voters in the state, 58% to 32%.\u00a0Because of mounting concerns that Biden's standing is slipping, the campaign has embarked on an urgent effort to try to shore up support among older voters, suburbanites and African Americans to try to make up for losses elsewhere.\u00a0Hispanic voters in Florida tend to be somewhat more Republican-leaning than Hispanic voters nationwide because of the state's Cuban American population, which Trump acknowledged several times in his remarks.",

            "article_content": "The presidential horse race remains unchanged by recent protests \u2014 Joe Biden still leads President Trump by the same margins nationally and in the battleground state of Wisconsin.\u00a0 Here's why: though neither candidate gets rave reviews for what they've said about the demonstrations, Biden is seen by more as trying to calm the situation, while the president is perceived by slightly more as encouraging fighting, rather than calming things down. And the larger notion that violence could come to \"the suburbs\" finds little concern among those who actually reside in the suburbs. Moreover, it's also about the approach to those protests: by more than two to one, voters feel the way to end the them is to make police reforms and address discrimination, not to use law enforcement to punish protesters. Even the president's own backers aren't overly convinced the latter approach is better.\u00a0 Voters see the protests composed of a mix of well-intentioned demonstrators and people out for more destructive aims, but they appear to distinguish between the two: between the peaceful protesters \u2014 with whom, people say they can identify \u2014 and those destroying property, with whom they can't. And eight in 10 people in suburbs feel it's unlikely that violent protests would happen where they live. More generally, it's Biden who leads on who'd make you feel safe. This is a general measure, not specifically about protests, but it speaks to the larger themes the campaigns are using. But if the protests haven't moved the race, something else still could as we head into fall: it's comparisons on the\u00a0economy\u00a0where this race looks more competitive.\u00a0 The economy is a salient item: for those not backing Biden, their worry about what Biden would do on\u00a0economics\u00a0\u2014 not what he'd do on race, or policing \u2014 is foremost in their minds.\u00a0 But Biden does lead on ability to handle coronavirus, and his backers are most concerned about what Trump might do on that if he wins. Among voters who say the protests are a major factor in their vote, Biden and Trump are running about even in Wisconsin \u2014 not much different from last month. Nationally, Biden leads among this group by five points.\u00a0 In Wisconsin and nationally, Biden's handling of recent protests about the treatment of African Americans by police is met with slightly higher approval than President Trump's.\u00a0 More voters in Wisconsin see the intentions of most of the protestors as trying to change police treatment of minorities and raise awareness about racial discrimination. Republicans differ in that they are more inclined to say the protestors are trying to destroy property or overthrow the government. As in many incumbent elections, voters tell us 2020 still very much looks like a referendum on Donald Trump, for good or bad, in this sense:\u00a0 Asked what they're voting on, the retrospective dominates the prospective. It is Trump's performance over the last four years, more so than anything Trump might do with another four, or what Biden might do if he wins, that most people tell us is foremost in their decision. This is especially true for Republicans. Meanwhile Biden's voters are still largely motivated in opposition to Trump, even more so than because they like Biden. While there was some small short-term movement on that right after the convention, the president has returned to being a more central point in their thinking. Most Democrats think things are going badly in America right now and more than eight in 10 of them think President Trump bears \"a lot\" of responsibility for that. Many Republicans feel things are going badly too, but most of them don't hold the president responsible for that. Biden greatly outpaces Mr. Trump on the qualities of having \"the right temperament,\" and \"cares about people.\" Mr. Trump is seen as having more energy. And Biden continues to get more positive reviews than Mr. Trump on how he handles himself personally. Meanwhile, negative reactions to the Trump administration's COVID response continue to shape votes, and public views run counter to many administration's arguments. Even as some questioned the extent of fatalities, it's the\u00a0relative\u00a0measure that matters: More feel the administration's policies are to blame for making the outbreak worse than deserve credit for holding back the extent of it. More say fatalities could have been lower, with earlier planning, than might have been higher were it not for the effective actions taken. And perhaps most ominously, by almost twenty points, more think the outbreak is going to get worse than better this fall. But not all see the virus as totally linked to the economy: only Democrats believe the economy cannot recover until COVID is under control. Republicans overwhelmingly disagree and independents marginally do.\u00a0 Mr. Trump and Biden both come out of their conventions with robust support from their current voters, with almost nine in 10 each saying their support is very strong, with Biden's up a bit more. And with less than two months before the election, motivation to vote is high among both Democratic and Republican voters. Biden maintains his lead over Mr. Trump nationally and is also ahead in Wisconsin, as he was in early August, and his estimate is now 50%. Biden continues to hold a double-digit lead over Mr. Trump with women, and the race remains close among men. In Wisconsin, Biden has a 9-point lead with White women, wider than the 2-point margin Hillary Clinton had in 2016. Mr. Trump maintains his lead with White men but it is narrower than this 2016 margin. On the protests, women voters in Wisconsin (including white women) give Biden more positive marks than Mr. Trump on handling the protests, while men tend to give the president higher marks.\u00a0 We continue to see a divide among White voters by education, with college graduates backing Biden and those without a degree supporting Mr. Trump. However, Mr. Trump's margin among the latter group is substantially smaller than it was four years ago. In Wisconsin, Trump has actually lost more ground among White, non-college voters than among White college graduates, which is a key reason the state\u00a0currently leans Democratic. With eight weeks to go until the election, Republicans are more likely to say their candidate is campaigning enough than Democrats are to say that about theirs. Four in 10 Democrats feel Biden isn't campaigning enough. Half of Independents agree with them. These surveys were conducted on behalf of CBS News by YouGov between September 2-4 2020. They are based on representative samples of 2,493 registered voters nationwide and 1,006 registered voters in Wisconsin. Margins of error for registered voters: National: +/- 2.4 points, Wisconsin +/- 3.7 points. Toplines: Wisconsin toplines:",

The move comes as mammoth protests have swept the United States and the world calling for an end to hundreds of years of racial discrimination against black people.  \"We feel like we're getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference,\" James told the Times.   The organization, called More Than A Vote, aims to encourage African Americans to register to vote and to show up to the polls for the November 3 elections.\u00a0   The group will also fight against any factors that could contribute to African Americans' disenfranchisement.   \"Yes, we want you to go out and vote, but we're also going to give you the tutorial,\" James told the Times. \"We're going to give you the background of how to vote and what they're trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.\"  James, who has more than 135 million followers across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, said he plans to use social media to denounce attempts to limit voting by racial minorities.   \"King James\" himself will finance the project, joined by basketball players Trae Young and Jalen Rose, football player Alvin Kamara and comedian Kevin Hart.  The group plans to collaborate with other get-out-the-vote organizations, the newspaper reported, including When We All Vote and Fair Fight.   The initiative comes as the U.S. grapples with renewed anger over racism and police violence after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who was killed last month when a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. James had expressed his own anger on Instagram, posting Floyd's last words \"I can't breathe.\" But James' voting rights move immediately drew pushback from leading Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who tweeted about James' failure to back protesters there: Defending democracy is vital, but @KingJames only talks loud in the US. On China, not only is he silent, he actively shuts others up. He called @dmorey \"misinformed\" and \"not really educated\" for supporting #HongKong. All he cares about is money, not human rights. Hypocritical. https://t.co/vxVMWIjsjY pic.twitter.com/YJ3fbBnteM The voting movement is not the Los Angeles Laker's first foray into politics. He appeared at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.   Nor is it his first charitable endeavor: He has offered university scholarships through the LeBron James Family Foundation and even set up a school for third through eighth graders in his home state of Ohio.\u00a0   James also heads a production studio producing a documentary about the massacre of approximately 300 African Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921.",

            "article_content": "The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery fought to end segregation, lived to see the election of the country's first black president and echoed the call for \"justice to roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream\" in America.  For more than four decades after the death of his friend and civil rights icon, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the fiery Alabama preacher was on the front line of the battle for equality, with an unforgettable delivery that rivaled King's - and was often more unpredictable. Lowery had a knack for cutting to the core of the country's conscience with commentary steeped in scripture, refusing to back down whether the audience was a Jim Crow racist or a U.S. president.  \"We ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back; when brown can stick around; when yellow will be mellow; when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right,\" Lowery  prayed at President Barack Obama's  inaugural benediction in 2009.  Lowery, 98, died Friday at home in Atlanta, surrounded by family members, they said in a statement. He died from natural causes unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak, the statement said.\u00a0 \"Tonight, the great Reverend Joseph E. Lowery transitioned from earth to eternity,\" The King Center in Atlanta remembered  Lowery in a Friday night tweet. \"He was a champion for civil rights, a challenger of injustice, a dear friend to the King family.\"  Lowery led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for two decades - restoring the organization's financial stability and pressuring businesses not to trade with South Africa's apartheid-era regime - before retiring in 1997.   Considered the dean of civil rights veterans, he lived to celebrate a November 2008 milestone that few of his movement colleagues thought they would ever witness - the election of an African-American president.  At an emotional victory celebration for President-elect Barack Obama in Atlanta, Lowery said, \"America tonight is in the process of being born again.\"  An early and enthusiastic supporter of Obama over then-Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Lowery also gave the benediction at Obama's inauguration.  \"We thank you for the empowering of thy servant, our 44th president, to inspire our nation to believe that, yes, we can work together to achieve a more perfect union,\" he said.  In 2009, Obama awarded Lowery the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.\u00a0 In another high-profile moment, Lowery drew a standing ovation at the 2006 funeral of King's widow, Coretta Scott King, when he criticized the war in Iraq, saying, \"For war, billions more, but no more for the poor.\" The comment also drew head shakes from then-President George Bush and his father, former president George H.W. Bush, who were seated behind the pulpit.  Lowery's involvement in civil rights grew naturally out of his Christian faith. He often preached that racial discrimination in housing, employment and health care was at odds with such fundamental Christian values as human worth and the brotherhood of man.  \"I've never felt your ministry should be totally devoted to making a heavenly home. I thought it should also be devoted to making your home here heavenly,\" he once said.  Lowery remained active in fighting issues such as war, poverty and racism long after retirement, and survived prostate cancer and throat surgery after he beat Jim Crow.  His wife, Evelyn Gibson Lowery, who worked alongside her husband of nearly 70 years and served as head of SCLC/WOMEN, died in 2013.  \"I'll miss you, Uncle Joe. You finally made it up to see Aunt Evelyn again,\" King's daughter, Bernice King, said in a tweet  Friday night.  Lowery was pastor of the Warren Street Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama, in the 1950s when he met King, who then lived in Montgomery, Alabama. Lowery's meetings with King, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy and other civil rights activists led to the SCLC's formation in 1957. The group became a leading force in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s.  Lowery became SCLC president in 1977 following the resignation of Abernathy, who had taken the job after King was assassinated in 1968. He took over an SCLC that was deeply in debt and losing members rapidly. Lowery helped the organization survive and guided it on a new course that embraced more mainstream social and economic policies.  Coretta Scott King once said Lowery \"has led more marches and been in the trenches more than anyone since Martin.\"  He was arrested in 1983 in North Carolina for protesting the dumping of toxic wastes in a predominantly black county and in 1984 in Washington while demonstrating against apartheid.  He recalled a 1979 confrontation in Decatur, Alabama, when he and others were protesting the case of a mentally disabled black man charged with rape. He recalled that bullets whizzed inches above their heads and a group of Klan members confronted them.  \"I could hear them go 'whoosh,'\" Lowery said. \"I'll never forget that. I almost died 24 miles from where I was born.\"  In the mid-1980s, he led a boycott that persuaded the Winn-Dixie grocery chain to stop selling South African canned fruit and frozen fish when that nation was in the grip of apartheid.  He also continued to urge blacks to exercise their hard-won rights by registering to vote.  \"Black people need to understand that the right to vote was not a gift of our political system but came as a result of blood, sweat and tears,\" he said in 1985.  Like King, Lowery juggled his civil rights work with ministry. He pastored United Methodist churches in Atlanta for decades and continued preaching long after retiring.  Born in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1921, Joseph Echols Lowery grew up in a Methodist church where his great-grandfather, the Rev. Howard Echols, was the first black pastor. Lowery's father, a grocery store owner, often protested racism in the community.  After college, Lowery edited a newspaper and taught school in Birmingham, but the idea of becoming a minister \"just kept gnawing and gnawing at me,\" he said. After marrying Evelyn Gibson, a Methodist preacher's daughter, he began his first pastorate in Birmingham in 1948.  In a 1998 interview, Lowery said he was optimistic that true racial equality would one day be achieved.  \"I believe in the final triumph of righteousness,\" he said. \"The Bible says weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\"  A member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Lowery is survived by his three daughters, Yvonne Kennedy, Karen Lowery and Cheryl Lowery.",

            "article_content": "Every four years it can seem like the path to the presidency runs through the same list of well-trodden battleground states. But this time, we're on some newer turf: Democrats are contesting some states in the fast-growing Sun Belt \u2014 notably Arizona \u2014which has been in the Republican column all but once since Eisenhower. And Republicans would love to leverage their White, working-class support in the Upper Midwest to flip Minnesota, which oh-so-narrowly eluded them four years ago to keep its string of Democratic votes unbroken since 1976.\u00a0 Right now that potential trade looks tilted in favor of the Democrats. Let's start in Arizona, where Joe Biden has moved out to a small lead, ahead by three points, an edge that's increased from the tied race we found in July. It was then we first saw concern about COVID and the president's handling of it putting the state in play. Though that virus concern has come off its highs of the summer, it remains for a sizable two-thirds of voters, and is still closely tied to vote: the more concerned voters are, the less likely they are to be voting for President Trump. And in a week that raised more questions about what the president knew about the virus early on, Arizonans feel that the nation's death toll could have been mitigated had plans been made sooner, and more pin blame on the administration for making the outbreak worse than give it credit for what it\u00a0did\u00a0do. Most voters think the administration could still be doing more right now to combat the virus. And so, on balance, Biden comes away with a 13-point lead on who would better handle the outbreak.\u00a0 The economic fallout from the pandemic is certainly affecting things here too: more than half say they've felt at least some financial impact from it, and they're voting for Biden, 57%-32%. But that said, the president is very much in this contest. Much of that starts with continuing, solid support from Republicans, who \u2014 as in other states \u2014 describe a very different state of affairs. For an overwhelming number of them, the president headed off an even-worse outbreak and is doing all he can against it today; his policies are helping the economy recover, and it can recover\u00a0even if the virus isn't contained. It's not that Republicans were immune to the financial impact \u2014 four in 10 report at least some impact \u2014 but to them the president is still making the economy better now, and is better than Biden on handling the virus too. Bolstered by that GOP base, the president is up overall among those who call the economy an important factor. He's narrowly up over Biden on handling the economy, generally, and manufacturing, specifically.\u00a0 It's just that right now, in Arizona, it's not only about the economy. Feelings are dour about the nation's condition, more generally. A mere 18% of Arizona's voters feel confident about the country today (and three times more feel uneasy); 26% describe themselves as optimistic; 10% say they feel \"secure,\" and all of that looks like headwinds for an incumbent, even one with relatively good economic marks against his opponent.\u00a0 More White women have shifted toward Biden since July. He is now running neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump among them. And Biden enjoys a double-digit advantage over the president with White women with a college degree.\u00a0 Sixty-two percent of Latinos are backing Biden, similar to the level of support Hillary Clinton got in 2016.\u00a0 Among each candidate's supporters in Arizona, 96% say they're strong in their support. Given that, the coming weeks here do not look like a campaign about changing minds or swing voters. It looks more like a contest of two partisan factions with very different views of what's happened in America this year \u2014 a contest about motivation and turnout. About 1,600 miles north in Minnesota, we find the Republicans with their work really cut out for them. Biden has a substantial nine-point lead, backed by improvement over Democrats' 2016 performance with college-degree holding voters, particularly college-educated White women. His current percentage is 13 points better than Hillary Clinton's was in 2016 and is closer to what Democrats got in the 2018 midterms.\u00a0 For these women, 61% are voting for Biden mainly to oppose Mr. Trump, higher on that motivation than Biden's voters overall. Even those who think the state's economy is doing well are mostly voting for Biden. And 83% of them dislike how the president handles himself personally, higher than voters overall by double digits. With Biden doing better among women and White women than Democrats did in 2016, it becomes harder for the president to flip the state. Still, for White, non-college voters who helped the president make the state so close last time, Mr. Trump offers some clear advantages. By more than two to one, they think he'd be better on energy exploration, and by large margins on manufacturing, agriculture, and farming \u2014 all important industries in Minnesota \u2014 as well on small business. These voters also believe Biden pays more attention to the concerns of Black voters than to those of White voters. But that may not be enough, as Mr. Trump's margin with the group is less pronounced than it was in 2016. He's at plus-15 with them now, versus plus-27 against Clinton.\u00a0 Three months after the death of George Floyd sparked protests across the country, more than half of Minnesota voters \u2014 an electorate that is overwhelmingly White \u2014 say they agree with the ideas expressed by the Black Lives Matters movement. That's similar to how voters feel nationwide.\u00a0 Majorities across the political spectrum say the recent protests in U.S. cities will be a major factor in their vote for president, but Republicans have different ideas about the best way to end them. While most Minnesota voters think there need to be police reforms that address racial discrimination, just over half of Republicans think the police and law enforcement should be used to punish the protesters.\u00a0 Looking at one of the president's campaign messages on the potential spread of violent protests generally, it doesn't appear to be changing many votes. While nearly half (45%) of Minnesota's suburban voters do feel it is at least somewhat likely that \"large, violent demonstrations, rioting and looting\" may occur where they live, it's Republican suburbanites \u2014 already voting for the president \u2014 who are more likely than Democratic suburbanites to say this. And if it causes concern, it is not changing suburban views on how to deal with the protests: even among those who think such an occurrence is likely, a majority still thinks the way to stop them is through police reform, rather than the police cracking down on the protesters.\u00a0 Partisans also view the goals of the protesters differently. Majorities of Democrats and Republicans agree that the protesters are trying change the way police treat minorities, but most Democrats and independents also think protesters are trying to raise the issue of racial discrimination and act peacefully. Most Republicans don't think the protesters intend to do either. Instead, nearly nine in 10 Republicans think most protestors are trying to destroy property, and seven in 10 Republicans say they believe most protesters are trying to overthrow the government. Like most registered voters across the country, Minnesota voters tend to disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling the protests across U.S. cities, and they say he is encouraging fighting rather than trying to calm the situation. In contrast, voters see Biden as doing the opposite, and most approve his handling of the issue. Republicans see things differently: to them it is Mr. Trump who is trying to calm the situation and Biden who is encouraging fighting. Finally, looking at the\u00a0larger electoral map\u00a0once again, if Democrats do hold Minnesota, it puts some extra pressure on Republicans to hang on to Arizona, since the two states have similar numbers of electoral votes. These surveys were conducted on behalf of CBS News by YouGov between September 9-11 2020. They are based on representative samples of 1,122 registered voters in Arizona and 1,100 in Minnesota.

            "article_content": "Staff members at Planned Parenthood's national Washington, D.C., office say they have unionized and reached an agreement with management to improve workers' rights. The move toward collective bargaining comes as Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights groups have been scrutinized for workplace issues, including a lack of diversity within management. Union leadership told CBS News exclusively that Planned Parenthood's roughly 70 union-eligible D.C. staffers unanimously voted to join SEIU Local 500, a local branch of the second-largest union in the U.S. Under the agreement, Planned Parenthood management will \"address equity in the workplace, codify benefits, and provide members a voice in organizational decision making.\"\u00a0 The agreement between Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its D.C. staffers comes after nearly four years of negotiations that began under the organization's former president Cecile Richards, union leaders told CBS News. After announcing their intention to unionize in September 2016, negotiations stalled following President Trump's election when Planned Parenthood found itself playing defense against an unprecedented wave of abortion restrictions. The organization's D.C. office unionized to \"ensure Planned Parenthood's long-term security and build collective power for the workers who make it possible for the organization to successfully carry out its mission,\" said Aaron Wilder, a member of the bargaining unit leadership team and regional campaign manager at Planned Parenthood. \"We are the doers: the employees who come to the job every day to tirelessly fight for Planned Parenthood patients and reproductive rights,\" Wilder said in an email to CBS News. \"The PPFA national office fully believes in the rights of staff to organize and unionize, and supports the DC and Miami unions,\" said Melanie Newman, a Planned Parenthood spokesperson, in an email to CBS News. The organization's move towards unionization comes after accusations of poor working environments and unfair treatment of Black staffers at some of the country's most prominent reproductive health organizations, including Planned Parenthood. NARAL, an abortion-rights group, was accused last month of failing to include enough people of color in senior-level management positions, including its board. At Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, the group's largest affiliate, allegations of abusive behavior and racial discrimination resulted in the ouster of its chief executive officer. \"The things that have been highlighted at some of our affiliates, well, the national office isn't immune,\" said a Planned Parenthood employee and member of its union leadership who asked not to be named. \"White supremacy rears its ugly head everywhere we go, even in progressive and nonprofit spaces.\" The employee said the \"union provides that layer of protections for people to be able to speak out and to address these issues.\" The chief executives at both Planned Parenthood and NARAL have apologized for a lack of diversity within their senior ranks and promised to make changes to address the issue. \"We have real work ahead of us to ensure staff feel safe and valued, particularly our staff of color who are asked to represent and advocate for the mission, while often quietly shouldering the accountability work inside,\" said Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood's president, in a tweet last month, addressing those accusations. \"They do that work quietly because speaking up often comes at a personal cost. Too many people of color, particularly Black women, face unfair backlash for speaking truth to power.\" Planned Parenthood's D.C. staffers are the organization's second federal office to reach a collective bargaining agreement; the group's federal Miami bureau unionized in 2018. A handful of Planned Parenthood's roughly 50 affiliates have also unionized.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Almost a majority of Americans disapprove of President Trump's response to the protests and the events in Minneapolis, according to a\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0released Tuesday. The new poll also found that 56% of Americans believe the president tweets divide the country, not unite, report\u00a0CBS News associate producers Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0Sarah Ewall-Wice. The CBS News polling shows that voters have seen more of the president lately than of Joe Biden. About 19% of Americans haven't heard enough about Mr. Trump's response whereas about 42% said they have not heard enough from Biden. Despite his lack of visibility, Biden leads Mr. Trump by 4 points in a head-to-head national matchup in the poll released on Tuesday. Biden has had a 2 to 6 point lead over Mr. Trump since February.\u00a0 This comes as\u00a0CBS News\u00a0found 57% believe police treat white people better than black people, including nearly 8 out of 10 black people. At the same time, separate\u00a0polling by Monmouth University\u00a0found 57% now believe that when faced with a \"difficult or dangerous situation,\" police are more likely to use excessive force if the culprit is black, up from 34% in 2016, and overall, 76% of Americans say that racial and ethnic discrimination in the United States is a big problem, while just 7% say it is not. That poll also found 53% say race relations have gotten worse under Mr. Trump, while just 10% say they have gotten better.\u00a0 Meanwhile, as parts of the country reopen,\u00a0CBS News polling\u00a0found 57% believe states reopening over the next few months will make the coronavirus outbreak worse, while only 16% say it will make it better and 27% believe it will have no effect. Americans also continue to believe the virus has a disproportionate impact on minority communities, with 57% saying it will have \"a lot\" of impact on black communities and 52% saying it will have \"a lot\" of impact on Hispanic communities. Only 28% said it would have \"a lot\" of impact on white communities. The majority of Americans still believe the priority should be staying home to stop the spread with 63% to the 37% who believe the priority should be on the economy. Even as stay-at-home restrictions ease, 54% say they'll only go to some public places if they feel safe.\u00a0 Only 19% said they'd go to as many public places as before if those places open. \u00a0 JOE BIDEN In his speech from Philadelphia, Biden\u00a0said\u00a0the president was \"part of the problem\" and not the solution in defeating the \"formidable enemies\" of systemic racism and the pandemic health effects, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0CBSNews.com digital politics reporter Grace Segers. Biden said the anger after George Floyd's death is understandable but he also said this could be a time for unity. If elected, he admitted he would not \"get it right all the time\" but he pledged to not traffic in fear and to not \"fan the flames of hate\" or \"use them for political gain.\" The former vice president also ripped Mr. Trump, recommending the president read the Bible he displayed on Monday evening and then telling him to pick up a Constitution to take in the First Amendment. Biden said the country needs more than \"talk\" and needs to vow \"an era of action\" to reverse systemic racism. He said Congress and leaders must make a \"down payment\" on this effort for better policing, adding his voice for the call to ban police chokeholds. Biden may attend George Floyd's funeral next week in Texas, Floyd family attorney Ben Crump told\u00a0CBS News producer Chris St. Peter. Crump said Biden is welcome to attend and they are awaiting final plans from the campaign. PRESIDENT TRUMP In the wake of Mr. Trump calling himself \"your president of law and order,\" the president's allies cheered. While Republicans remained largely silent as the White House deployed law enforcement to clear out protesters ahead of his photo op before historic St. John's Church, most Trump Republicans offered their approval. Jason Miller, former senior adviser on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, said he found the president's \"symbolic move\" of walking across Lafayette Park to St. John's Church reminiscent of President George W. Bush's visit to the rubble beneath the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. \"Showing that we weren't going to be afraid to retake ground that was ours before, from some act of illegality or terrorism,\" Miller remarked. \"President Trump made that happen last night by appearing in the same place we saw images of the church on fire and absolute chaos the night before.\" Longtime Trump ally and Republican GOP chairman Steve Stepanek called the President's photo-op outside St. John's a \"positive\" step in restoring order. \"The President said enough is enough. It's going to stop, and it stops right here.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Trump campaign co-chair, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, however, spoke out against the president's first venture outside White House grounds in 48 hours. \"If your question is should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo op, the answer is no,\" Scott told Politico. Republican donor and Trump supporter Dan Eberhart told CBS News that the president did not reach out to all Americans on Monday, but instead addressed the \"Bible Belt,\" in an effort to appear as a strong leader that won't cow to the protests surrounding his home.\u00a0 \"The president takes the protests and destruction around the White House as a personal attack against him,\" Eberhart said. \"The left has been protesting against his presidency from the first day in office. In this instance, he promised justice for Floyd's family, but it did not make a difference. From his perspective, the protests are because he's the president.\" The Trump campaign took shots at Biden's address to the nation, today. \"Joe Biden's campaign made it clear that they stand with the rioters, the people burning businesses in minority communities and causing mayhem, by donating to post bail for those arrested,\" Trump campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson wrote. \"He has obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.\" The President tweeted out his response. \"Sleepy Joe has been in politics for 40 years, and did nothing,\" the President wrote. \"Now he pretends to have the answers. He doesn't even know the questions. Weakness will never beat anarchists, looters or thugs, and Joe has been politically weak all of his life. LAW & ORDER!\" TAMMY DUCKWORTH Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois blasted Mr. Trump's Rose Garden address on threatening to\u00a0deploy the military\u00a0to quell protests across the nation if local officials cannot eradicate the violence.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Duckworth also addressed peaceful protesters outside the White House being driven out by tear gas so the president could participate in an apparent photo op outside St. John's Episcopal Church. \"Tear-gassing peaceful protesters is not leadership, it's cowardice,\" Duckworth said in a statement. \"Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial.\" Duckworth added that leaders need to listen to citizens advocating for justice and to \"not silence them with force.\" GRETCHEN WHITMER Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer testified before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday on the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The governor said she was grateful for the support the federal government has provided thus far, but she also outlined some challenges the state has faced in obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing supplies. The Democratic governor said that when the state is expecting shipments of supplies from the federal government, the shipment does not \"reflect what we are planning for.\" Whitmer said Michigan has the capacity to conduct more tests per day, but added that the lack of a national strategy around testing has inhibited the state from reaching its testing capability. \"Until there's a centralized procurement and allocation with real time information about what's coming so that we can do our planning, it's going to be hard for us to hit those numbers that, that we all know are, are necessary to understanding how fast COVID-19 is so we can prevent the spread,\" Whitmer said. Representative David McKinley of West Virginia, a Republican, grilled Whitmer on waiting until March 26 to request a major disaster declaration from the president and on her state's coronavirus response in nursing homes. Whitmer replied, \"I'm not going to go toe-to-toe with you on every allegation that you've alleged.\" Whitmer continued, \"The United States lost valuable time in the early days of COVID-19, when we could have been planning, when there could have been a national strategy, when the use of the DPA could have been used not for meat production, but for swabs, which we still don't have enough of.\" The Michigan Republican Party criticized Whitmer's testimony as \"another platform to bash the Trump administration's coronavirus response.\" Michigan Republican Party Chairman Laura Cox said, \"Despite her partisan testimony before Capitol Hill today, Michiganders know the truth about Governor Whitmer's actions.\" Cox added, \"She has used this pandemic to raise her national profile at the expense of the people of our state who are suffering.\" CORY BOOKER Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said he and Harris will be releasing a comprehensive police reform proposal in the coming days, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The proposal, Booker says, takes into account the work of the Congressional Black Caucus and will be centered around police accountability. In his remarks on the Senate floor, Booker said the proposal will create an accountability, and give \"back faith to the people that have lost it.\" He continued in his remarks, \"I confess to you even something that's hard to admit, that the spirit and courage and grit being shown by the people on streets, not in the comfortable halls of the Senate\u2014I want to tell you right now that that is not enough. It is essential, but it is not enough. These things are necessary but not sufficient.\" PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH President George W. Bush said he is \"anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd,\" in his first statement released Tuesday on the death of the Minneapolis man in police custody, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The forty-third president noted he has resisted speaking out on the matter because he does not wish to lecture. \"It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures \u2014   and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths,\" Mr. Bush. \"It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy \u2014 in a long series of similar tragedies \u2014 raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society?\" In stark contrast to Mr. Trump's remarks Monday from the Rose Garden, the former president called for leaders to listen to the aggrieved. \"Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America \u2014 or how it becomes a better place.\" Mr. Bush wrote \"The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way \u2014 the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice.\" EDUCATION Recent college graduate Emily Knell was a weekend away from starting a new job helping struggling elementary students when the coronavirus pandemic put the next phase of her life on hold. \"They cannot really give me any answers as to when I can expect to go back to work,\" she said. \u00a0\"And since I didn't technically start, I can't get unemployment. I haven't had a paycheck since February.\" Knell, who graduated early from Penn State University last summer and moved home to work and pay off student loans before graduate school, said she's now working one day a week for her father and has deferred her student loans. She said the virus has thrown her life into a state of \"limbo.\" Millions of students graduating are beginning a new phase of their lives as the coronavirus pandemic shattered the world around them. They're facing the worst job market since the Great Depression, and some companies have even been forced to revoke internships and full-time job offers. CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the life of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Pennsylvania, over a dozen interviews with students graduating or who recently graduated from college pieced together a mosaic of stories about change, disappointment and uncertainty. New graduates have moved back home mid-semester, lost job opportunities or otherwise had their plans altered by the pandemic. Although change is inherent in graduation at every level, for members of the Class of 2020, the pandemic presents an entirely new level of uncertainty.\u00a0 Read more of their stories\u00a0here\u00a0from\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0on CBSNews.com.\u00a0 PARTY PLANNING In the latest development of an\u00a0ongoing saga\u00a0about the Republican National Convention being held in Charlotte this fall,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports\u00a0that North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters Tuesday that the likelihood of the gathering being hosted in Charlotte depends on the willingness of the GOP to scale back. \"They have demanded a full 19,000-person crowd at the inside arena in Charlotte. We've continued to say we want to talk with you about a scaled-down convention but we cannot guarantee you that at the end of August, you can have a full arena,\" said Cooper during a press conference Tuesday. \"And we're still waiting for answers to our health questions about how they would take steps to protect people about social distancing and facemasks and we have not heard a response from that.\" The press conference came minutes after RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted a statement saying that the RNC has \"an obligation\" to delegates and the president to visit \"multiple cities and states\" that have expressed interest in hosting the event. \"We have now communicated to Governor Cooper's office multiple times that we would like to showcase Charlotte and the wonderful state of North Carolina to the world by hosting the convention we contracted for nearly two years ago,\"\u00a0tweeted\u00a0McDaniel. \"It is unfortunate the Governor is dragging his feet on giving us any guidance as to how to move forward with plans to safely conduct our convention\u2026\" Congressional members from both Carolinas joined the North Carolina Republican Party and a state North Carolina representative on Tuesday morning to call on Cooper to outline clear steps for the RNC to take as it plans for the Charlotte-based convention. Republican leaders have called on the Democratic governor to greenlight the party's proposal by tomorrow, June 3.\u00a0 President Trump tweeted\u00a0Tuesday night that North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper \"forced\" him to seek another state for the convention. \u00a0Mr. Trump tweeted\u00a0\"Roy Cooper and his representatives refuse to guarantee that we can have use of the Spectrum Arena\" and he said Cooper is still in \"shelter-in-place mode.\" Mr. Trump added that the convention would bring in \"millions of dollars\" and \"would have showcased beautiful North Carolina to the World.\" \u00a0 DELEGATE SITUATIONS As the country grapples with the coronavirus and nationwide protests, seven states and D.C. are holding presidential primaries on Tuesday with 479 delegates up for grabs, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee, but he is still 460 delegates away from clinching the nomination, according to the current CBS News delegate estimate. Vote tallies will start coming in Tuesday evening, but final results may require a few days or longer given that many states are using vote-by-mail and some counties have already warned it will take a couple of days to count ballots. Biden picked up early wins in Indiana, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, CBS News projected. The early results give him at least 129 more delegates, putting him at 1,683 delegates total out of the 1,991 needed to officially clinch the Democratic nomination. The states holding presidential primaries Tuesday night are Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Dakota.     PAC ATTACK The Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA is out with a new television ad today that features video from Mr. Trump's remarks Monday from the Rose Garden as protesters were violently cleared from the park outside the White House, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. \u00a0The minute-long ad titled \"Antithetical\" will run as part of a seven-figure weekly ad buy in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \u00a0In it, Mr. Trump claims to be a president of \"law and order\" and an \"ally of all peaceful protesters,\" but the video shows people with their hands up being tear gassed and shoved by law enforcement officers in full tactical gear. It also uses clips from interviews of both retired lieutenant general Russel Honor\u00e9 and Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington slamming the President and his use of St. John's Church for a photo-op. \u00a0Priorities USA plans to spend $200 million by the end of the year. At the same time, the anti-Trump PAC The Lincoln Project just started airing its latest ad taking aim at the president, titled \"Treason,\" which focuses on the confederate flag appearing at past Trump events, as well as uses the President's comments on the Charlottesville rally in 2017. According to data from Kantar/CMAG, the ad first aired Tuesday morning in the battleground state of North Carolina. In the past two days, The Lincoln Project has spent more than $500,000 on ad buys in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and DC. NEVADA The Republican National Committee and Nevada's Republican party\u00a0have sued a Nevada county for public records they say could shed light on deliberation over changes to the county's upcoming all-mail primary. The decision by Clark County, Nevada's largest by population, to send mail ballots to all registered voters had been trumpeted last month by Democrats\u00a0as a victory. But Republicans have decried the move as a \"shady\u00a0backroom deal,\" prompting the GOP to send a letter to Nevada's attorney general in late May\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0over a \"potential Nevada open public meeting violation and election irregularities.\" In an email to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, county spokesperson Dan Kulin said, \"This lawsuit is based upon suspicions not facts and we expect to prevail.\" Democrats late Monday also\u00a0dismissed news of the lawsuit\u00a0as \"just more of the same from Trump and Republicans,\" denouncing the court filing as \"continuing their campaign of disinformation to undermine the integrity of the election process.\" PENNSYLVANIA Pennsylvania's primary election on Tuesday is offering a glimpse into the preferences of Democrats and Republicans for voting during a pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Nearly 20 times as many voters as in the 2016 primary in the state have applied for mail-in voting, allowed without an excuse for the first time in the state. The battleground state has about 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, and Democrats have vastly outnumbered Republicans for mail-in ballot requests, according to Pennsylvania State Department data. Nearly a third of registered Democrats have applied to vote-by-mail, but only about 16% of Republicans have. As the deadline to vote by mail approached in the state, elections lawyers and county officials warned that many residents who applied to vote by mail would receive their ballots with too little time to get them back to elections offices by June 2. Governor Tom Wolf on Monday issued an executive order delaying the deadline for mail-in ballots to arrive by a week in six counties, including the populous Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. The Department of State has approved polling place cuts of up to 60% across Pennsylvania, but by nearly 90 percent in the Allegheny County. At the Fulton Elementary School in Pittsburgh's 11th Ward, a line snaked down the street by late afternoon, with voters reporting waiting up to 45 minutes. Some voters there had applied to vote by mail, but never received a ballot. Faith Cotter, a Democrat from East Liberty, said she and her fianc\u00e9 applied for mail-in ballots in mid-April, long before the May 26 deadline, but never received them. \"I have asthma, so I've been staying inside except going for jogs and stuff like that,\" she said. \"I didn't plan to be here in person. \" IN THE HOUSE While\u00a0Congressman Steve King's race\u00a0is the biggest storyline in Tuesday's House primaries, a Republican primary in nearby Indiana was also one to watch, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Since Congresswoman Susan Brooks announced this would be her last term serving Indiana's 5th district, 15 Republicans have filed for the open seat. Brooks currently serves as a recruitment chair for the National Republican Congressional Committee, and her retirement came amidst a\u00a0record low amount of Republican women serving in the House.\u00a0Her potential successors included Treasurer Kelly Mitchell and newcomer Beth Henderson, though State Senator Victoria Spartz ended up\u00a0winning the nomination on Tuesday night. Former State Representative Christina Hale\u00a0has locked up the nomination\u00a0for Democrats, who have put this central Indiana seat on their target list. Another open seat race is in Indiana's 1st district, currently represented by Democrat Peter Visclosky. Fourteen Democrats and six Republicans filed for this district which encompasses parts of the Chicago southwest suburbs and Gary, Indiana. In New York, long-ime Congressman and current House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel was caught on a hot mic during a local press conference about Monday's protests in the Bronx. Engel\u00a0is heard asking Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. for a speaking slot, and after being told that there's too many people already on the list, Engel said twice, \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care.\" In response, Diaz Jr. said, \"Don't do that to me. We're not going to do this.\" Engel is facing a competitive primary against progressive Jamaal Bowman, who\u00a0was recently endorsed\u00a0by two other Democratic challengers. \"This is so incredibly painful to watch from @RepEliotEngel. It hurts,\" Bowman\u00a0Tweeted. \"We need to be taking care of our communities right now \u2013 whether it's election season or not. It's clear that we need new leadership in #NY16.\"\u00a0 IN THE SENATE Republican senators were asked by reporters in the halls of the Capitol about Mr. Trump's visit to St. John's on Monday night. Many senators ignored the question or said they had not seen the footage, but\u00a0CBS News Capitol Hill producer Alan He\u00a0reports Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine strongly criticized the president's photo-op. \"All of us are upset at the fire that was set at the church, a historic house of worship for many, many presidents,\" Collins said, \"But I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and as insensitive to the rights of people to peacefully protest.\" Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also said \"I did not think that what we saw last night was the America that I know.\" In a press conference after the Senate GOP's weekly lunch,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0reports Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters about the events that sparked the protests, \"I think we all agree egregious wrongs have been done, much of it recorded,\" and added, \"peaceful protest is what we need and there is much work still to be done in America with regard to race relations.\" MONTANA The Democratic gubernatorial primary between businesswoman Whitney Williams and Lieutenant Governor Mike Cooney is the biggest unknown out of Tuesday's primaries in Montana. Cooney has served alongside Governor Steve Bullock since 2016 and has been endorsed by Senator Jon Tester and\u00a0Bullock, who has enjoyed\u00a0relatively high approval ratings in the state. Cooney is also an established figure in Montana politics, as he began serving in the state legislature in 1976. But Williams slightly leads in fundraising, and has received some outside help and investment from groups like EMILY's List. In place of the usual preelection rallies, Williams has been holding \"Get Out The Vote\" rallies over Zoom.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports her \"Big Sky Bright Future\" rally on Monday featured actor Ben Affleck (a part-time resident of the state) and NBA legend Dikembe Mutombo, who said he'd visit the state a couple times to do some social work as a member of the Atlanta Hawks. \"Montana is not a new place to me... I know that state very well. I know we're here for Whitney, but for me, I'm here for a special friend,\" he said in his pitch of Williams to voters, adding that he's traveled with her in Africa for philanthropic work. \"She's had a passion in helping people...to make sure the future of our society is really protected.\" On the Republican side awaits either Montana's at-large Congressman Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Tim Fox or state Senator Al Olszewski. Gianforte previously ran as the state's Republican candidate in 2016, and is poised to clinch the nomination again this cycle due to outpacing his opponents in fundraising (and personal loans). One other thing to watch for in Montana today is how their change to sending absentee ballots to registered voters will go, something the state has not done before.\u00a0",

In the third arm of his \"Build Back Better\" jobs plan that was released on Tuesday, Biden focuses on childcare and eldercare, calling it a \"21st century caregiving\" model. \u00a0 Through this investment in quality, affordable care, Biden promises 3 million new jobs to aid those Americans out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic or who are underemployed. \"This is about easing the squeeze of working families,\" Biden said while laying out the plan in remarks in Delaware on Tuesday. \"I know it's hard to think of future when you're just trying to get through the crisis at hand.\" \u00a0 The price tag for this care plan is $775 billion over 10 years and the campaign insists it will be paid for by \"rolling back unproductive and unequal tax breaks for real estate investors with incomes over $400,000 and taking steps to increase tax compliance for high-income earners.\" Older Americans receive top billing in the plan and the majority of the appropriated money. According to a recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is making serious inroads with seniors, a group that tends to vote Republican.\u00a0 Biden says he will allocate $450 billion to give more seniors the choice to receive care at home or \"in supportive community situations.\" Specifically, the former vice president wants to target the 800,000-person Medicare waitlist for home and community care by increasing Medicaid funding to states. With an additional 150,000 more community health workers funded through \"direct grant funding\" specifically in places with \"systemic racial discrimination,\" Biden wants to improve care quality, too. Altogether, 1.5 million new jobs are promised in the eldercare field.\u00a0 The next group of assistance is for childcare, with Biden's biggest promise being \"build[ing] our child care\u00a0infrastructure back better for the long-term, including by making high-quality child care\u00a0affordable and preschool universal for three and four year olds,\" the plan states. \"We are in a childcare emergency,\" Biden said in his speech on Tuesday.\u00a0 Through this childcare effort is the other half of the overall 3 million jobs guarantee, pledging to create new 1.5 million jobs in childcare services. Biden's already-announced universal pre-K for three, four and five year olds is also factored into this plan as an opportunity to save parents \"thousands\" of dollars per year on childcare costs. For low-income and middle class families, Biden wants to offer a $8,000 tax credit to help pay for child care. Other ways to assist with this universal childcare goal is capping childcare costs at 7% for low-income families, the price deemed by\u00a0Health and Human Services\u00a0Department when childcare begins to be unaffordable.\u00a0 Another element is \"incentivizing\" of \"bonus payments\" childcare providers to offer early morning, evening and weekend care. He also wants to increase hours of after-school, weekend and summer care for older kids. \u00a0Increasing care and community colleges for parents and Department of Defense institutions is also mentioned. Biden's campaign went to great lengths with reporters to compliment the plan putting care giving at the center of a jobs plan. Caregiving for children and the elderly is \"an issue for families, not just an issue for women,\" a Biden campaign official said, mentioning Biden's own personal experience raising his two sons after the death of his first wife. Along with this care plan, Biden has promised around 10 million new jobs in two additional plans that were released in July. The plans focused on increasing \"Buy American\" manufacturing and instituting a \"green economy\" with more emphasis on renewable energy.

            "article_content": "The year 2020 has been a battle for Asian Americans. A battle for their lives in a pandemic. A battle against racial bias and attacks. A battle for respect as essential workers and business owners. Most of all, it has always been a struggle to be seen and heard as Americans.\u00a0 George Takei, the \"Star Trek\" actor and civil rights activist, spent time in a Japanese American internment camp when he was a child in World War II. He says this is history repeating itself: \"Asian American hate is as old as American history and overnight, this country was swept up by suspicion and fear and naked, outright hatred. We had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor. There was no charge. Other than looking like this.\" In \"Asian Americans: Battling Bias,\" a CBSN special produced by the CBS News Race and Culture unit, CBSN anchor Elaine Quijano reports on the devastating effects COVID-19 has on the Asian American community, which has a much higher mortality rate than White Americans. \"The South Asian and the Filipino American population are known to have higher rates of diabetes,\" which is known \"to be a predisposing factor to worse outcomes,\" said Chicago cardiologist Dr. Nilay Shah. Economically, over 233,000 Asian American businesses have closed and unemployment has tripled.\u00a0 CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang reports on the growing number of racist attacks many Asian Americans have endured. Over a three-month period, over 2,120 hate incidents or crimes were reported by Asian Americans between March and June, according to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action. There's been a nearly 845% increase compared to all the reported cases in 2017, 2018 and 2019 combined. The tone of the country has been exacerbated by President Trump, who refers to the virus as \"Kung Flu\" or the \"Chinese virus.\" According to the 2020 Asian American Voter Survey, which surveyed over 1,569 Asian American voters, 51% of respondents were concerned about hate crimes related to COVID-19, and, over 79% believed that discrimination against Asian Americans exists in society.\u00a0 CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen reports on a new generation of Asian Americans who have found common ground with Black Lives Matter and the shared experience of discrimination.\u00a0 \"Black and Brown\" has become synonymous with Black Americans and South Asian Americans. Young people of all colors are on the frontlines of protests around the country. Activist Tiffany Tso said, \"COVID-19 definitely sparked another awakening, where younger generations of Asian Americans have been for the first time experiencing \u2014 this more overt, in your face racism.\"\u00a0 CBS News correspondent Michael George reports on the new power of a growing minority that now has over 11 million voters in November's election. There are pockets of Asian American voters in congressional districts in swing states like Nevada, Arizona and Texas that could have a big effect on the presidential election.\u00a0 Nevada community activist Jaewon Jung said, \"I am scared for the future of the country. I think one of the biggest issues right now is that people are so divided. One thing I'm going to look for in a candidate is to unite all of the groups together.\"\u00a0 After a tough 2020, Asian Americans are hoping to see a more United States of America in 2021. Takei summed it up best, \"If we remain invisible and voiceless, then we will be victimized.\" Zoe Christen Jones contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Amid the coronavirus and protests against racial injustice, CBSN is launching a new series focused on voting rights, safety, and access. This is the first in the series, which will include in-depth reporting and conversations. In the lead-up to November, you'll hear a familiar refrain from politicians and on the airwaves: \"Want to make a difference and effect change? Vote.\" It seems like an easy course of action, and it should be. But voting isn't easy for everyone. There are regulations in place that make it more difficult for some people. And that's no accident. \"The vote is the heart of American democracy. We all believe that passionately, but it's also been a big fight over the centuries about how we vote, who votes, and very often people trying to make it harder for other people to vote,\" says Michael Waldman, president of the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.\u00a0 \"Barriers are put in the way and they're often subtle,\" says Waldman. \"They can look kind of bureaucratic and complex, but in fact they have the same kind of impact, unfair impact, on Black voters and Latino voters of some of the laws from the past. Voter suppression is not just something from long ago newsreels. It happens today. It happens now.\"\u00a0Many key restrictions have been implemented over the past decade, and involve voter ID laws, cutting back on early voting, eliminating same-day registration and redistricting.\u00a0\"We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot. but even as we sit here, there are those in power are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting,\" former President Obama said in a eulogy for John Lewis, whose activism led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u00a0\u00a0That monumental law banned literacy tests and other discriminatory barriers to voting. It contained a provision mandating that states and localities with a history of such discrimination seek federal approval to change their voting laws. But in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down that part of the law, arguing it was based on old data.\u00a0 \"What that means practically is there is nothing that stops a state from passing a new law and evaluating first whether or not it's discriminatory, and any effort to stop it has to be after the fact,\" says Deuel Ross, Senior Counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \"It's much easier for states to pass discriminatory voting laws,\" he suggests, because states no longer need the federal government's consent. Such laws can only then be challenged in court.\u00a0One of those laws centers on voter ID measures. Thirty-five states currently request or require voters to present some form of identification in order to cast their ballot, and several key battleground states have strict enforcement. Groups like the American Bar Association have voiced concern that laws requiring a government-issued ID make it more difficult for minorities to vote, noting that \"individuals who lack government-issued identification are more likely to be younger, less educated, and impoverished, and\u2014most notably\u2014nonwhite.\" Experts say the pandemic threatens further disenfranchisement. The CARES Act passed in the spring allocated about $400 million to conduct safe elections, but election officials have sounded the alarm that this is not enough. They anticipate a shortage of poll worker because many of those filling this role tend to be senior citizens, and they are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Fewer poll workers in November would likely lead to fewer polling locations and therefore, longer lines.\u00a0\u00a0Many states have expanded the option of mail-in voting during the pandemic. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia do not require an excuse to vote absentee. Last week, Kentucky announced a bipartisan deal to allow voters concerned about the pandemic to vote absentee.\u00a0\u00a0But additional barriers exist. Nine states require voters to produce witness signatures or have their ballot signed by a public notary.\u00a0\u00a0Most states require absentee ballots to be returned by Election Day, so threats to Postal Service funding could end up suppressing votes. A bipartisan group of senators has asked for $25 billion in additional funds for the USPS. President Trump has railed against mail-in voting and said he wants to hold up funding in exchange for other provisions.\u00a0\u00a0Last week, the Postal Service warned 41 states and D.C. that some ballots sent by mail may not arrive in time to be counted. Late arrival is a top reason for ballot rejection\u00a0and could become a source of litigation in a close election.\u00a0Election officials encourage voters to mail in their ballots early to give themselves plenty of time for them to arrive. And voters don't have to rely on the Postal Service \u2014 instead, hand it to your local election clerk or place it in a county drop box, if available.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, with President Trump painting a bleak portrait of America under a Biden administration, Americans are reeling from more racial injustice protests, devastating natural disasters, and continued spread of COVID-19. With the dark days of August coming to an end, the challenges facing America in the fall are staggering. As the clock ticks down to Election Day, the competition between the candidates is now focused on just how bad things would be under the other guy's leadership.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today's Democrat Party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden's supporters on the streets, screaming and shouting at bystanders, with unhinged, manic rage.\u00a0JOE BIDEN: The problem we have right now is we're in Donald Trump's America.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Jacob Blake was paralyzed following a police shooting, saw more unrest this weekend, as did Portland, Oregon, where protests have been held for ninety-one nights.\u00a0SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: The reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: For the most part it's been peaceful protestors seeking justice, but the President is calling for law and order.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. Plus, we'll here from Florida Congresswoman Val Demings. She's a former police chief and a Biden supporter. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron supports the President and is overseeing the Breonna Taylor case. We'll also speak to Attorney Benjamin Crump. He's representing the Taylor and Blake families. Former FDA Commission and Doctor Scott Gottlieb will give us an update on COVID-19. Finally, as the sports world fights racism in America with boycotts, an emotional public plea.\u00a0DOC RIVERS: It's amazing to me why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with CBS News special correspondent and host of The NFL Today, our own James Brown.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It is another grim Sunday morning here in Washington. In the aftermath of protests at Black Lives Matter Plaza just down the street from us here at CBS, as well as in other cities across the country. This as the number of corona cases worldwide passed the twenty-five-million mark. Almost a quarter of those cases are here in the U.S. The death toll is near a hundred and eighty-three thousand. We begin this morning with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta, Georgia.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): Chaos overnight in Washington, DC, one block from the White House. Police waving steel batons cleared out a couple hundred Black Lives Matter protesters. They also fired teargas and flashbang grenades to get people moving. The clashes were among the worst seen here in the last couple months.\u00a0MAN #1: I think that's not my car.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: More confrontation across the country in Portland, Oregon. A caravan of Trump supporters drove downtown and scuffled with protesters.\u00a0MAN #2: Get back in your car, dude.\u00a0MAN #3: Pull the flag up. What are you going to do?\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Suddenly gunfire. A man lay dead in the street, shot in the chest. Police say the hat he wore represented a far right group. They've battled before with protesters here who have gathered nightly for months.\u00a0MAN #4: And thank you for our cops for not doing damn thing.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): No justice, no peace.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: And this is Kenosha, Wisconsin, at the intersection of injustice and outrage. It's not on a GPS, you have to feel it to find it, like these protesters.\u00a0MAN #5: Say hi name.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): Jacob Blake.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN:\u00a0 They marched again this weekend because Jacob Blake may never walk again. A week ago his three children screamed as a white police officer shot him seven times in the back.\u00a0JACOB BLAKE SR.: What gave them the right to think that my son was an animal?\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Blake's father addressed protesters.\u00a0JACOB BLAKE SR.: I'm tired of this. I'm tired of this. No justice.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): No peace.\u00a0JACOB BLAKE SR.: No justice.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): No peace.\u00a0JACOB BLAKE SR.: And we're not going to stop.\u00a0MAN #6: (INDISTINCT) takes the three and hits it.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Back in action this weekend, NBA playoff games. After the Kenosha shooting, players began boycotting to protest issues of social justice. Work stoppages spread across the WNBA, Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball before games resumed. Dodgers superstar Mookie Betts:\u00a0MOOKIE BETTS: Doc said there's a lot going on in the world and change needs to be made.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: America's other ongoing crisis is COVID, also still in search of needed change. Nationally, new cases and deaths are generally falling. But the new health worry is in Midwest and Upper Plains States, where new cases are rising. And the CDC stumbled again this week. Its revised guidance suggested limited testing to patients who show viral symptoms. Public health experts pounced. Forty percent of people with COVID show no symptoms and can spread the virus. Director Robert Redfield later said anyone exposed to the virus can get tested.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: And with schools from kindergarten to college reopening across the country, health experts expect another COVID spike. Sometime in the next three weeks, America's official COVID death toll will top two hundred thousand people. Just like those protesters the virus shows no sign of disappearing. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. Thank you.\u00a0We want to go now to the Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. He joins us from FEMA headquarters here in Washington. Good morning to you.\u00a0CHAD WOLF (Acting Homeland Security Secretary/@DHS_Wolf): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what is going on in Portland overnight. We saw a man there killed during dueling demonstrations between a pro-Trump caravan and Black Lives Matters activists. Given the situation, which seems very tense, will the Trump administration ask for everyone, including those pro-Trump supporters, to pull back?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Well, we've been asking Portland to do their job really for over three months now. What you see in Portland is an environment--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm asking about the pro-Trump supporters.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: --they-- they foster an environment-- they foster an environment of this lawlessness and chaos. We've-- we've been asking the governor and others to send in the National Guard to address the violence so that you don't have dueling demonstrations. You don't have this violence that occurs night after night after night on the streets of Portland. So, we need them to do their job. We need them to step up. And if they can't or they don't have the ability or the resources, ask the federal government. We'll provide those resources, as we've done in Wisconsin and in others, so that we can address any violence, any violence across the spectrum.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- I hear what you're saying, but the President has tweeted about Portland twelve times in the past forty-eight hours, including retweeting a video of his supporters, people with Trump flags flying, driving into Portland, and he called them \"Great Patriots.\" Doesn't that heightened tension when you say you're trying to lower it?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Absolutely not. I think what-- again, what we see in Portland and various other cities is-- is--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you endorse this as the President appears to be doing?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: --local officials not doing their job and protecting the people of those communities. And what we've seen in Portland is almost three months, three months of allowing individuals to come in night after night and set fire to government buildings with little to no consequences.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you saying that the local officials have failed to stop the Trump supporters from driving into Portland?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: I-- I've-- they have failed to stop--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the President seems to be endorsing them doing so.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: They have failed to-- to protect their communities, specifically in Portland. And we've seen that. We have over seventy-four-- over ninety arrests, seventy-four different criminal citations that the FBI is pursuing against individuals. We need Portland to step up, bring this violence to a close, and I think you'll see a lot of this go away.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. It sounds then like you're asking Portland officials to crack down on the Trump supporters, too. If that's not what you mean, please clarify. The President said that--\u00a0CHAD WOLF: I'm ask--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. Sorry\u00a0CHAD WOLF: I'm asking Portland officials, so that's the mayor, that's the governor and that's local law enforcement to do their job to address any violent activity that is occurring in their streets. As soon as they do that-- again, we'll see that, as we've seen in Wisconsin and other places, we'll see the violence go down to almost zero. And this will address the issue that Portland has been dealing with for three months--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: --that the citizens of Portland have been dealing with for over three months. It's time to end lawlessness and the chaos that we see in Portland.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The President said Friday at his New Hampshire rally that he's been discussing invoking the Insurrection Act to deal with Wisconsin. He's mentioned things about Portland, as well. You've been in the room when the President has discussed using the Insurrection Act in the past. Do you support its use now to send in active-duty military to American cities?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Again, I'm not going to get in front of the President on any decisions that he may or may not make, but what I can tell you--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I am not asking about the President's decision. I'm asking if you support?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: What I can tell you is I have been in-- I have been in a number of decisions, in a number of meetings where we have addressed and talked about the violence that's going on in a number of cities around this country, including Portland, but also Wisconsin, Chicago, Atlanta, and other cities. The President's been very clear. I think he made very-- numerous public statements asking state and local officials to do their job and if they can't, request assistance from the federal government. Department of Justice will send assets. The department will send assets if there's federal facilities or federal law enforcement officers being targeted. And we will help them to provide assets and resources that they don't have.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, that sounds like no since that would be seeking consent of the governor and local officials. It sounds like you're saying, no, you don't support the Insurrection Act. If that's not the case, please, clarify.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Margaret, I-- again, Margaret, what I will tell you is, again, I'm not going to get in front of the President. What I support is making sure that we bring this violence in a number of these cities around the country to an end.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's going on with election security. DHS is the primary federal agency tasked with overseeing election security. Will your agency continue to brief both houses of Congress on election security?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Absolutely. We've--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In-person?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: --done that over twenty-five-- yes, Margaret. Again, if I can answer. Absolutely. We've done that over twenty-five times in the last two months. We have briefings, in-person briefings set up this week for the Senate and the House. And we have another eight or nine scheduled between now and the election. Again, I think what people need to differentiate between what the department does and what the intelligence community does, the department, DHS, through our CISA, Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency, we're focused on cyber threats targeting election infrastructure. And we're going to continue to work with our secretaries of state around the country, but also brief members of Congress. A lot of the information that the department deals with is in an unclassified nature. And so we're happy to continue to share the good work that we're doing to try to secure those systems ahead of the November elections.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the director of National Intelligence informed Congress that he will not brief in person, at least members of the House, on election security as it relates to foreign interference. Given that you say it is a concern to protect the integrity of elections, why are you limiting information flow to elected lawmakers?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Again, the DNI statement that he put out, again, they deal with classified intelligence.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: His concern is the leak-- is the leak of that classified intelligence. They're going to continue to provide Congress all the information they need in a written, finished intelligence product so that Congress can have the information they need to do their oversight responsibilities. So this is not about limiting access. This is about providing the information to Congress. They're going to do that in a different format.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But you feel comfortable sharing classified information with members of Congress?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Again, the information that we share with Congress that we brief with Congress is almost exclusively unclassified information. And again, it's about cyber threats to election infrastructure. Different from the foreign interference or disinformation campaigns that the intelligence communities and others are dealing with.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Wolf, thank you very much for joining us today.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Okay, thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Democratic Congresswoman Val Demings. She joins us this morning from her district in Orlando. Good morning to you.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS (D-Florida/@RepValDemings): Good morning. It's great to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on what's happened overnight, given the violence in Portland where Black Lives Matter activists clashed with these pro Trump supporters. What is your-- your message to the activists themselves? It's been more than ninety days of protest. Now you have a fatality. Do things need to de-escalate?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, let me just say this: After listening to the interview you had with Acting Secretary Wolf, Margaret, this is exactly what happens when Homeland Security, the intelligence community, the military, and others who were charged with protecting our homeland are politicized. And so listening to the secretary just really sends a strong message that the President is not capable of fulfilling his duties, which his primary responsibility is the health, safety and well-being of the American people. Wouldn't it be--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the activists themselves? What is your message to them?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Yeah, but wouldn't it be nice for the President of the United States to take to the microphone or the airwaves and send a message for peace and calm, talking to the protesters, talking to the demonstrators, but also talking to those who come in and loot and steal and do harm, those who are on his side--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --his supporters who have come in and taken the lives of people trying to send a calming and peaceful message. And this is a time, more now than ever that we need--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --to hear from the President of the United States. But the chaos and the disorder and the lawlessness that we are currently seeing, that's Donald Trump's America.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand the point you're trying to make here. But when it comes to the activists, and I understand how well-intentioned the protest may be, but there have been a number of incidents, including here in Washington, DC, where the other day your-- your congressional colleague, Senator Rand Paul, was encircled by a mob shouting Breonna Taylor's name. He said he feared for his life. Has some element of these protests gotten out of hand?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: What I am saying is that in America, we know that demonstrators have the right to demonstrate guaranteed by the First Amendment.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: However, we are a nation of laws, and anyone on any side in any place who violates the law has to be held accountable. We don't condemn people who are obeying the law because of those who do not obey the law. We can do both--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: -and we have done both in this America, and that's what we need to do. And, again, we need the President of the United States to show some leadership during this situation. But that may be asking for too much from President Trump.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you-- you know that the President's slogan is law and order. He's been using it repeatedly in recent days. Don't incidents like the one we just saw or what's happening in Portland play into your opponent's argument?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Margaret, as you know, I served on the Intelligence Community-- Committee and the Judiciary Committee. I served as an impeachment manager. It is quite interesting to listen to President Donald John Trump talk about being the law and order President when no one has violated the law in 2020 more than he has. We're talking about a President who just had his kickoff for his re-election on the grounds of the White House. And we all know that that was a violation of law. Clearly, again, those who obey the law--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --should be able to peacefully demonstrate and-- and exercise their First Amendment right. Those who do not, up to and including the President of the United States, regardless of the circumstances, should be and must be held accountable.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House argues they got permission from the Office of Special Counsel for that. But I want to move on to ask you about what's happening in Wisconsin. President Trump says he's going to visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, Tuesday. Is candidate Biden or Senator Kamala Harris, should they go? Do they plan to go to Kenosha as well?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, I'm not really sure what Vice President Biden's plans are. What I can say is that, you know, there's a lot going on in the grounds in Wisconsin right now. And every time a high-profile visit is-- is made, there are a lot of resources that have to go into that visit. However, as the President of the United States, whether it's a natural disaster or civil unrest, I think should take the time--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --and the resources to go and be on the ground and, again, provide that peace and calm. And again, Margaret, as we talk about what is going on, civil unrest that is happening, unfortunately, in our nation, it's something we're certainly familiar with and have been familiar with for decades. But I would say as we try to resolve this situation--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --I think as we have these discussions, it's important that we stop talking about the police and start talking to the police--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --and start talking with the police.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, since you were a former police chief, what happened to Jacob Blake shot seven times. The police were responding and knew there was a warrant out for his arrest. Is there in any way any justification for what happened?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: I think what we have to do is all take a deep breath. If we want justice to be served, we've got to wait until a thorough and complete investigation is done. We do not want to play judge, jury and executioner, whether we're talking about Mister Blake or we're talking about the police officer. We want the facts and we must have all of them if we want to see justice served. And I believe we all do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Demings, thank you for joining us.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with Kentucky's Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Republican attorney general of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron. He joins us this morning from Louisville. Good morning to you.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON (Attorney General of Kentucky/@kyoag): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for joining us. You were at the RNC this week giving a full-throated endorsement of President Trump. I want to ask you about something he did this morning when he liked a tweet from a supporter who wrote, \"Kyle Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.\" That's the seventeen-year-old who shot three people, killing two of them in Kenosha this week when he took the law into his own hands. Is that the kind of law and order for America that the President endorses and you support?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Well, let me just say that I condone violence in all of its forms. I want to make that clear from the very beginning. I also want to address, you know, during my speech Tuesday evening, I tried to make it very clear that as Republicans, we recognize those who in earnest want to make sure that there's peace, justice, and equality in this country--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you mean condemn, Sir?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: I'm sorry, say that again.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You said condone.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Say that again please.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I think perhaps you misspoke when you said you condone violence, you meant you condemn it?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: No, condemn violence in all forms. Absolutely, yes, Ma'am.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: During your speech, when you endorsed President Trump, you spent a lot of time talking about race and in particular comments that Joe Biden has made about black Americans that you found offensive, you said. Did you also find it offensive when President Trump tweeted last month a video of supporters of his yelling white power?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Well, look, what I was trying to articulate the other evening is that Joe Biden, the way that he looks at the black vote, he looks at it as a monolithic vote. In my judgment, there is great diversity within the black community. And Joe Biden doesn't seem to get that message nor understand it. And so what I was trying to say the other evening is that Joe Biden has taken for granted African-Americans in this country. And whether you are a black conservative or a black Democrat or moderate--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: --I think it is wise to look at your options during this campaign and make an individual assessment--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: --of who will better serve your interests. That was what I was trying to articulate. And I think that President Trump, look, he fights every day for the American worker. I can certainly say that I've known him for--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But on this specific-- sorry. But on that very specific question of something he tweeted that-- that your fellow Republican Senator Tim Scott, on this program rejected and before that has said in his view President Trump does say things that are racially insensitive. To be clear, were you also offended when the President did this?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Well, I look again, I condemn any sorts of violence, any sort of racist rhetoric. I certainly recognize that this is a country that is ever growing and evolving. The Republican Party stands with those who welcome peace, justice, and equality. I think just like your viewers, we can certainly tell the difference between those that in earnest want to make sure that there's peace, justice and equality in this country as opposed that are trying to hijack this moment.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Again, President Trump can speak for himself and-- and voters get to make an assessment of him--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: --and President-- Vice President Pence. So, look, I appreciate the way that President Trump has reached out to me, brought me into the fold in terms of conversations about law and order. We cannot have chaos reign in the streets.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I don't think anyone wants chaos reigning in the streets, Sir. But we will have to take a commercial break and continue our conversation with you on the other side of it. So please stay with us. And all of you, please stay with us, because there's much more ahead.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News is launching a new franchise for original reporting on issues that affect traditionally underrepresented communities. It is called CBS Village, and it's debuting with the Power of August, which is a new documentary that explores key moments in civil rights history that happened during the month of August. To watch, go to cbsnews.com/live.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, and we'll hear from the civil rights attorney, representing the Blake family, Benjamin Crump. Plus, Doctor Scott Gottlieb, and our own James Brown. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Let's pick up where we left off with Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.\u00a0Glad to have you back with us. I want to begin asking you about where the Republican Party is right now in terms of this particular issue. According to our CBS News Battleground Tracker, eight in ten Republicans think that there has been too much attention recently on the issue of discrimination compared to forty-four percent of voters overall and twelve percent of Democrats. Do you believe that discrimination is talked too much about in our country?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Well, look, again, I will point back to the remarks that I made on Tuesday evening where I talked about the Republican Party wanting justice, peace and equality, and we certainly recognize anybody who has an agenda that is consistent with those values. But, again, like your viewers, we can certainly tell the difference between those that want those things in earnest and those who are trying to hijack a moment. So I think that poll probably indicates those within our party who recognize the legitimacy of those who--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I was asking about you if you agree with those Republicans who say it's talked about too much?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: I think that we need to make sure that we have frank conversations about race and-- and color and discrimination within this country. There's--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So no.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: --again, the Republican Party has been founded on the idea of making sure that those are marginalized and vulnerable in this country have a fair shake.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: As attorney general in Kentucky, you will make the decision as to what happens to those police officers involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor. Why has it taken you this long? It's been five months. When will you actually make a decision on whether to sentence them and charge them?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Well, at-- at-- in the-- Representative Deming's right before I came on talked about wanting a thorough and fair investigation, and I wholeheartedly agree with that. That's what we have been conducting here in the Commonwealth. As part of my time in Washington, DC. I met with the Department of Justice and FBI. We've got a critical component here as it relates to a ballistics report. There's no video footage of the incident in question and Miss Taylor's passing. And I can announce to you today as part of those efforts early this week, we have received that ballistics report. Now, again, that is a critical piece of this investigation. It's not the end all be all. There are still some witness testimony and interviews that have to be conducted. But we do have that ballistics report. We will be meeting with the FBI at the beginning of this upcoming week to have a painstaking review of that information. And that will help us in the analysis that needs to be undertaken before we can get to final steps. But just again, like Representative Deming said--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: --we need a thorough and fair investigation, and I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm curious as to what information you need, specifically, that you are hoping to learn from this ballistics. I just want to read from a letter from-- that was written to one of the three officers terminated. It was from the chief of police to that officer. And it is scathing. It says, Brett Hankinson displayed an \"\u2026extreme indifference to the value of human life when you wantonly and blindly fired ten rounds into the apartment of Breonna Taylor\u2026\" He says the shooter wouldn't have even been able to know who he was firing at. Some of the rounds went into the apartment next door. It sounds like he was just blindly firing here. How is that not clearly a criminal action? What is it that you actually need to hear more than what the police chief has said himself?\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Well, Margaret, I don't want to get into the specifics. It is an ongoing investigation and I don't want to compromise it in any way, but be confident. And again, your viewers should know that we are looking under every stone, leaving no stone unturned as it relates to this investigation. Again, a thorough and fair investigation is what is deserve-- deserved by all those involved. Look, as the attorney general, initially, this was not our case. We took this case--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: --because we have the resources internally to conduct a fair and thorough investigation. We've got career prosecutors and investigators with a wealth of knowledge and information that can undertake an independent investigation.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: And we also have the strength of relationships with the FBI to receive this balli-- ballistics report and information that can be critical to our analysis.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we look forward to hearing an update from you now that you have that information. Thank you very much, Mister Attorney General.\u00a0DANIEL CAMERON: Yes, Ma'am. Thank you.\u00a0We turn now to Benjamin Crump. He is the attorney representing the family of Jacob Blake. He's also represented the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, and he joins us from Tallahassee, Florida. Mister Crump, if you could respond to the news that we just heard from Daniel Cameron, the attorney general. He said that they now have the ballistics report from the FBI, which suggests something is happening, forward movement with this case after five months. What are you expecting?\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP (Civil Rights Attorney Representing Family of Jacob Blake/@AttorneyCrump): Well, Margaret, thank you for having me. And that is welcome news because since Breonna Taylor was executed in the sanctity of her own home by this no-knock warrant that was dangerously executed, we have been trying to get answers, our legal team. And as for her mother, who every day demanded from the police department, why did they execute her daughter in her own apartment? And they've gotten no answers. It's just been delay tactic, delay tactic, delay tactic. We've been told when they get the ballistics report that's what they needed to wrap up this investigation and finally give them answers that they so desperately want and the community so desperately needs to try to heal. So, at this point, we are hoping that this conclusion will be sooner rather than later because justice delayed is justice denied.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you suggesting that the attorney general was deliberately delaying this? Is that what you are suggesting here?\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: Well, I know Breonna Taylor's family is distrustful of the entire system. You must remember, Margaret, the police report, this three-page police report erroneously reported that there was no forced entry and that there were no injuries, even though Breonna Taylor's body was mutilated with eight bullets while she was practically naked. And so, this is the conspiracy that the family believe was at the beginning to sweep her death under the rug. So, you have to forgive them from not trust in any law enforcement officials right now and why black people all over America are distrustful--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: --because when it is fitting for them, they released information very quickly. But when it's something that holds the police accountable, it's we got this long, exhaustive investigation.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Jacob Blake, whose-- whose family you are working with. How is he doing? And how are the three children who were in his car when they watched their father being shot?\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: Margaret, thank you for asking about Jacob. Obviously, he suffered catastrophic injuries. A bullet pierced his spinal cord, a bullet shattered his vertebrae. A bullet went into his intestines where he lost most of his intestines. A bullet went into his colon where he lost his colon. A bullet went into his kidney. Thank God they were able to save that. He has two holes in the stomach. He has a hole in his arm from a bullet. He's lost control of the bowel movements. He has no functions of his male organs. And for the rest of his life, he's going to be a shell of himself. And his three little boys were in that car, ages eight years old, five years old and three years old. And they witnessed all of this. So, you can only imagine the psychological issues these little babies are going to have.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: And his eight-year-old son was celebrating his birthday. So, imagine what the rest of his birthdays are going to be each year.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Ugh. Our-- our thoughts are with his children. I want to ask you, the President has announced he plans to go to Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday and he will meet with law enforcement. Has the Blake family been contacted? Do they-- are they open to meeting with the President? Have they been asked?\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: The Blake family has not been contacted at this time. Blake family is very respectful of all our elected officials. And as his mother says, she prays for all of our elected officials. So we will see from whether the President Trump's administration or Vice President Biden campaign, and him and Kamala Harris, the senator, have already spoken for about an hour--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: --to the Blake family. But they are just focused right now, Margaret, on trying to march for their son because he'd never be able to stand up--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: --for himself unless a miracle happens.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Crump, thank you very much for your time today.\u00a0We will be--\u00a0BENJAMIN CRUMP: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --right back with Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we are around forty-one thousand infections a day, nine hundred or so deaths a day. How dangerous is it to be taking this level of virus into the fall with us?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think it's concerning. August should have been a slow month. We should have seen infection levels come down in July and August. They didn't. We saw an epidemic cross over the Sun Belt and we saw infections actually increase. They're coming down now. So, that's a good sign. Hospitalizations are coming down. And I think that's the most important thing to be looking at because it's the most objective near-term measure on what the state of the epidemic really is. So, hospitalizations are about thirty-six thousand down from their peak. Hopefully, they'll continue to come down. But as we head into September and October, kids return to school. People are starting to return to work. We're likely to see infections start to go back up again. And we know that hospitalizations lag infections and so we could see hospitalizations rise as well. The most concerning trend right now is that as we see the cases fall in the Sun Belt, they're picking up in other parts of the country, particularly across the Midwest and the mid-- West, and particularly in rural parts of the country. And that's a big concern because those parts of the country probably have less health care resources to keep up--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --with the epidemic. They don't have the same kinds of hospitals and same kinds of resources to deal with an epidemic like this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about an interview that was just posted in the Financial Times with the FDA-- current FDA commissioner, Doctor Hahn. He said, or he appears to say, that he is open to approving a vaccine before phase three trials are completed. That's the stage at which the most sort of rigorous testing is done. I mean, Russia and China did this and were criticized. Why would the FDA commissioner say that he's considering doing that here in the U.S.?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I saw the article. I don't know what is meant by saying before the phase three trials are completed. These phase three trials are event-based trials, meaning that they're going to start to read out data after a certain amount of events accrue in the clinical trials. And those events are people getting COVID infection. And so as the trials progress, if we start to see lower rates of COVID infection in the active group, the group that receives the vaccine versus the placebo group, the group that hasn't received the vaccine. The trials could read out earlier if the-- if the vaccines are very effective. It's likely that the trials aren't going to read out until October. In order to read out in November-- in-- in November, they won't read out until November. In order to read out in October, the vaccines would have to be very effective. And so I'm not sure what he means by approving it earlier than when the trials are completed. They're going to wait for these trials to read out before they can make a decision around the efficacy of these vaccines. Now, it's likely going to be the case that the first authorization of these vaccines are going to be an emergency use authorization for select populations that are at higher risk of the infection, either because of what they do--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --people who work in health care, for example, health care jobs, or because of comorbidities, people who are older, maybe nursing home patients. So we're likely to see a stepwise progression of authorization of this vaccine for certain select populations that are at higher risk of either contracting it or having a bad outcome before we see a full approval for the general population. I think, again, of full approval for the general population, where people can go to CVS and get a shot, that's really a 2021 event, maybe the first quarter of 2021, probably more likely the first half.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But for the FDA commissioner to say something like this, I mean, it's going to be ultimately his job to approve a vaccine for Americans to go get those shots in the arm whenever they are available. For him to say something that suggests bypassing protocols, isn't that very damaging for the public agency that Americans need to trust?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think that the agency should be speaking to the process and the-- the process is rigorous. The process is well established. The agency has put out very clear guidelines of what the approvable-- approvability of these vaccines is, what the metric is that they're going to use as a basis to approve these vaccines. And what they've said is the vaccines need to be fifty percent effective in either reducing the incidence of COVID disease or reducing infection, reducing people actually getting infected. And so it's-- there's very clear objective criteria that's been put out. I think that's what the agency should be speaking to and its leadership should be speaking to, the process, the fact that it's-- it's well articulated. There's clear guidelines put out. It goes through multiple layers of review among professional scientists, career scientists who have been doing this a very long time. And, ultimately, the decisions are made by career leadership of the clinical centers, of the biologic center. I think people can have confidence in that process and that's what they should be pointing to, not speaking about, you know, the circumstances in which decisions might be made earlier or later. I think just focusing on the process and the process itself, if we rely on that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --it has integrity and rigor to it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be very clear. Are you saying that the FDA commissioner couldn't do what he seemed to say he would possibly do in this article?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't think the FDA commissioner could step in--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --and obviate a decision--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Gotcha.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --by the professional staff. And I don't think he can stop these trials early.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Gotcha. I want to ask you about schools. Schools in a number of states have seen some level of outbreak. Is it best practice to shut the school down or to just isolate those kids?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It depends on the precautions that the school has been taking. If schools are doing a better job of trying to control infection within the school, children are wearing masks, they have children in defined cohorts so that if there is an infection in one class, they know that-- that class hasn't been exposed to other classes. It's just the children in that particular pod. I think they can make a reasonable decision just to maybe have children in one particular class go and get tested, stay home until they clear, until they test negative as opposed to closing down the entire school. And this really speaks to the importance of putting those precautions in place so that they can isolate affect-- infection more effectively. And a lot of schools are doing that. I think that's very prudent.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. The CDC changed its guidance on testing. Why do you think they did it? Because the American Academy of Pediatrics says they object.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's unfortunate because I think that we should be testing asymptomatic people who might be at high risk of contracting the infection and what the new change in the guidance spoke to was the need not to test, purportedly not to test people who might have been exposed to the infection but haven't yet developed symptoms. We should be testing those people to make sure they haven't become infected and aren't asymptomatic carriers because we know that they can spread the infection. They're less likely to spread the infection, but they can still spread the infection. What I'm told by people on the inside is one of the reasons that drove this decision is that businesses were requiring people to test negative for infection before they can return to work. If that's the case and that was a concern, there were more targeted ways to address that and speak to that problem, as opposed to making this very broad, sweeping change in the recommendations, which I think could be misinterpreted by the general public and certainly by public health agencies within states. And so I don't think this-- this changed guidance is likely to be followed by many states. I think it's prudent that we test people who might be at high risk of contracting the infection.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, always good to talk to you. Thank you.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're all familiar with the public personalities of our sports heroes as we know them on the field, on the court, but the personal feelings of many athletes, black and white, came to light this week in the aftermath of the Jacob Blake shooting. We go now to CBS News special correspondent and host of NFL Today, James Brown. Good morning to you, JB. Great to have you here.\u00a0JAMES BROWN (CBS News Special Correspondent/@JBsportscaster/Host of NFL Today): Good morning. Good to be here, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean it seemed the entire sports world came to a halt this week, and as The New York Times put it, \"No longer was sports offering gentrified protest with league-endorsed slogans on basketball jerseys. Calm collapsed in the face of the inevitably growing power of players to make more than a statement. They took action. It shattered the bubble-- bubble of normalcy.\" How are these athletes using their megaphones?\u00a0JAMES BROWN: Power that they've always had, but have been on the opposite end in terms of people pushing back, specifically owners and the powers that be. Look, I think the best way to do it is to synopsize the result of my conversations this past week with players, league executives and many others. One, the players feel that they're at a crossroads, Margaret, that this is a significant point in history. They don't get the impression that anything significant is being done as they point a finger at leadership in general around the country, that they're not serious about changes. So, therefore, the athletes feel the platform that they have is one that they should handle responsibly. And number two, that they have a moral obligation to represent the marginalized and to advocate strongly for that until they see serious change made. And, to me, very uniquely, it's across the spectrum with all sports, the WNBA, the NBA, the NFL, which has been doing some significant things through the players coalition, through the legislative process, et cetera, and as well as hockey. Talk about a cultural change. About thirty percent of the hockey players are American born, but the rest, they're foreign.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.\u00a0JAMES BROWN: So-- but they're on board showing solidarity.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So is the change that we heard announced from the NBA, this agreement to try to, you know, put up voting booths in-- in stadiums and in arenas, the announcement that they'll have some sort of social justice coalition, is that the kind of change that the players wanted? Or will we see these protests continue?\u00a0JAMES BROWN: The-- the former of what you're saying, and you may still see the latter because they want to see significant change. Look, it's often been articulated, work through the system. That's what the athletes are doing. And they're not just advocating things. These players are doing things. When you look at the likes of LeBron James, when you look at the likes of the young players in the NFL, Patrick Mahomes and others, they are putting their resources and their actions where their articulation has been. And that's significant. Look, I remember Michael Thomas in the NFL mentioning to me before that he comes from the Houston district and many of the people there who are suffering saying thank you for being a voice for us because we're not being listened to. You are. And he's been on Capitol Hill for two years now, working as an intern to learn how to work through the system. But he represents a number of athletes who are doing that. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, James, from the players you talked to, do they feel like they're being forced into taking a stand here? Because what you're describing is sort of a passion project among some. But, you know, Charles Barkley this week said it is exhausting being black, especially when you're a celebrity. He said, \"I love Tom Brady, but nobody asks him about what's going on in white America.\" Is this an unfair burden or is this something the players feel is a passion project?\u00a0JAMES BROWN: It is reality in terms of what Charles Barkley said. Look, this isn't a black problem only because the only way the path forward and the only solution is for it to be inclusive. There's no way-- look, for four hundred plus years, African-Americans have been trying to articulate, advocate, scream about what the issues are, but have fallen on deaf ears. This is a tectonic shift reminiscent of back during the civil rights movement, when the world saw those black women and girls coming from church in their Sunday's finest being beat over the head with billy clubs, fire hoses on them, dogs being released. You know this is a human problem. So, yes, it is inclusive. And many of these athletes feel the passion because they come from those communities and have been doing the work for years. A number of years ago I worked with the NBA, NFL Players Association, presenting humbly the J.B. Awards, athletes who were working meaningfully to strengthen the fabric of their communities. They've been doing the work, but everybody else needs to get on board now and follow that. And it's for the right reasons. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A tectonic shift. Thank you very much, JB.\u00a0JAMES BROWN: Yeah. Yes, Ma'am. Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And I-- I want to tell all of our viewers that next Sunday, JB will be hosting a five-hour special about the courage of black athletes in the face of injustice. It's called Portraits in Black. It will be broadcast here on CBS at 1:00 P.M. eastern.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. And thanks to the entire FACE THE NATION team for all their hard work. For us this week I'm signing off, Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Just one week after the president announced his party had been\u00a0\"forced\" to seek a new location\u00a0for its convention,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Jacksonville, Florida has emerged as a new city of interest, following reports that the political gathering could take place there in August. According to an RNC convention official, several cities are still being considered and convention officials are touring multiple other cities this week including Phoenix, Savannah, and Dallas,\u00a0political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0reports. Republican officials have told CBS News that the party's official convention business will remain in North Carolina but the president's acceptance speech will be held in a different state. As previously reported by\u00a0campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0Watson, this decision came on the heels of an ongoing dispute between North Carolina's governor and the GOP over the convention format and safety measures amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Sganga\u00a0reports that Trump campaign officials have repeatedly said that the president desires a \"traditional\" and \"normal campaign rally\" with thousands of attendees in tow despite the ongoing pandemic recovery. President Trump said Wednesday the new location for his nomination speech will be announced \"soon,\" likely in Georgia or Florida. \"We wanted to stay in North Carolina very badly,\" Trump remarked. \"We love it. It's a great state \u2013 a state I won. Many, many friends, many relatives frankly that live there.\" Florida Republican Party chairman Joe Gruters\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Wednesday that \"Jacksonville is a front runner\" as the RNC makes a final decision. And in a statement provided to\u00a0Mitchell, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' office says the choice rests with the RNC, but the governor \"has been pretty clear that Florida is open for business\" and welcomes the opportunity to host the GOP convention. During a presser Wednesday, Duval County Republican Party Chairman Dean Black told reporters his team is expecting to get confirmation \"somewhere between hours and days\" on whether Jacksonville will be the new host city. If selected, Black added the city would have to take what would normally be \"about a two-year planning phase\" and \u00a0\"concentrate it down\" within roughly 75 days.\u00a0 Asked whether there were safety concerns for Jacksonville to potentially host the convention amid the coronavirus pandemic, Black said there are \"absolutely\" concerns but he's confident that Jacksonville officials will handle responsibly and plan carefully to ensure safety for attendees. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden continues to use this moment of national reflection over race to recommend ways to reform criminal justice in America,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. As he described in an op-ed in\u00a0USA Today, Biden backs a New York proposal to enhance penalties for making a false 9-1-1 call based on race, gender or religion. He also supports the concrete step taken by congressional Democrats to ban police choke holds.\u00a0 On a broader level, Biden also backs more transparency within law enforcement. Currently there is no standardized process for local police departments to report use of force statistics so the federal government is left with a mismatched set of data for use of force throughout the country. Biden hopes to change this reporting feature to see what issues are currently at hand.\u00a0 After the protests over George Floyd's death, Biden told\u00a0anchor and managing editor of \"CBS Evening News\" Norah O'Donnell\u00a0on Monday that his mindset for picking a running mate has not changed, though others have said they believe the protests and spotlight on racial justice increases the need for a racially diverse ticket. Asked about his VP thinking, senior adviser Symone Sanders told \"The View\" on Wednesday Biden \"hears\" the calls for him to pick a woman of color or a LGBTQ+ American. Sanders added, \"I will have to tell you that if you were to ask Joe Biden today, he would say he doesn't know who he's going to pick.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP President Trump is poised to kick off his first campaign rally since March 3 next week, after a three month hiatus due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The president announced Wednesday his next campaign event is slated for Friday, June 19 in Tulsa, Oklahoma at \"a beautiful new venue \u2013 brand new.\"\u00a0 The rally will take place on Juneteenth, a nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. Following the Oklahoma kick-off rally, the president said his campaign will do a \"big one\" in Florida and Texas, followed by Arizona. Deliberations by campaign aides do take into account new coronavirus cases, according to a senior campaign official, though it is unclear exactly what safety and health requirements will be put in place for attendees before they enter the venue. As more Americans venture out to socialize or protest, 22 states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases. President Trump rejected any renaming of Army installations commemorating Confederate leaders, one day after an Army spokesperson said Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy were \"open to a bipartisan discussion on the topic.\" In a series of\u00a0tweets, Mr. Trump argued the Army posts bearing the names of Confederate generals \"have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump's statement was printed and distributed to reporters during Wednesday's White House briefing. \"To suggest that these forts were somehow inherently racist and their names need to be changed is a complete disrespect to the men and women who the last bit of American land they saw before they went overseas and lost their lives were these forts,\" Kayleigh McEnany told reporters, adding the bases are \"known for the heroes within it, that trained there, that deployed from there.\"\u00a0 Retired General David Petraeus argued in favor of renaming the bases in an op-ed\u00a0Tuesday, writing the \"irony of training at bases named for those who took up arms against the United States, and for the right to enslave others, is inescapable to anyone paying attention.\" VEEPSTAKES STACEY ABRAMS Stacey Abrams appeared on \"CBS This Morning\" and responded to the polling headaches in Georgia on Tuesday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. She said the troubles were a sign of \"incompetence and malfeasance\". She added that Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was \"solely\" to blame, even when asked why these problems have persisted in the state for so long.\u00a0 According to Abrams, the GOP's desire to obstruct voting for Democratic areas of Georgia has backfired and seeped into all areas of the state. She also spoke about her own troubles with absentee voting. Abrams said she received a damaged return envelope and was forced to vote in person.\u00a0 Even though the issues she faced had nothing to do with scale or resources, Abrams asserted that large-scale vote-by-mail would work in November.\u00a0 Finally, Abrams was asked about her standing in veepstakes. Recall that before today she was vocal about her interest in being Joe Biden's running mate; however, today she was uncharacteristically mum about the job when asked by\u00a0CBS This Morning co-anchor Gayle King. Abrams would not say if she has been in talks with the Biden team, instead choosing to say that she's been focused on promoting her new book.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren is asking a federal bank regulator to undo his predecessor's update to anti-redlining regulations and to recuse himself from all future changes to them, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 \"This new rule would make it easier for banks to ignore and discriminate against minorities and the communities in which they live, and the rewrite was panned by community advocates, regulators, and bankers themselves,\" Warren wrote in a letter to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks June 7 that her office released Wednesday.\u00a0 At issue was former Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting's March final rule on the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which focused his office's evaluations of banks on dollar volumes lent rather than on the banks' physical presence in low-to-moderate income and minority communities. Warren wrote that the rule-making of Otting, who resigned a day after releasing the rule, was \"tainted\" by conflicts of interest because he had served as CEO of OneWest Bank, which in 2017 was sued for discrimination over the locations and closures of retail branches. Warren said Brooks, who also worked at OneWest, should recuse himself from all future rule-making.\u00a0 CONVENTIONAL WISDOM PARTY PLANNING Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez indicated the party's national convention will still happen in Milwaukee in some capacity during a press call with reporters and Wisconsin leaders on Wednesday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 Perez told the leaders on the call that he looks forward to seeing them in August \"when we descend on Milwaukee to celebrate our party.\" Perez said the convention will be \"safe and effective\" to highlight former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, and his \"historic choice of a running mate.\" Perez, however, wouldn't say how many people Democrats will be bringing to Milwaukee for the event.\u00a0 \"While I can't answer the question of exactly how many people will be there, because I don't know precisely what the public health situation will be on the ground, I'm confident we will be there,\" Perez said. He accused President Trump of \"abandoning Charlotte\" by looking for another city to hold at least part of the convention. \"We will follow the science and we will not abandon Milwaukee,\" Perez said. STATE-BY-STATE NEVADA Lines stretched for hours in Nevada overnight as some voters waited more than eight hours to cast ballots in the state's primary elections on Tuesday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. A group observing the polls said the last voter in Nevada cast their ballot\u00a0after 3 a.m PST, almost a full 24 hours after poll workers\u00a0started their shift early\u00a0Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Turnout for the contest\u00a0was the highest\u00a0of any primary for at least a decade in Nevada, despite myriad obstacles triggered by the pandemic: election officials consolidating hundreds of polling locations into a mere handful of sites, a shift to a vote-by-mail contest fraught\u00a0with court battles, concerns over voters\u00a0incorrectly filling out\u00a0their mail ballots, a location\u00a0being temporarily shuttered\u00a0over a worker testing positive for the virus ahead of election day, and COVID-19 precautions further\u00a0slowing the process\u00a0on Tuesday. Democrats blamed Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, the state's sole statewide elected Republican, for the long lines, the party's chairman saying in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday: \"These problems were entirely avoidable by the Secretary of State.\" NORTH CAROLINA The North Carolina State Board of Elections announced Wednesday that a Washington, D.C-based voter advocacy group mailed 80,000 absentee ballot request forms to North Carolina voters that were invalid because the forms were pre-filled with voters' information. The NCSBE stated in a press release Wednesday that the Center for Voter Information (CVI) advocacy group discontinued mailing the invalid forms after learning they were in violation of a\u00a0state law\u00a0that prohibits anyone other than a voter, a voter's near relative or verifiable legal guardian from completing written absentee ballot requests.\u00a0 The law was passed in 2019 after North Carolina was involved in an\u00a0absentee ballot harvesting scandal\u00a0that grabbed national headlines in 2018. Bob Hall, who was the former executive director of Democracy North Carolina for more than a decade, says that it would have been \"much more helpful\" if CVI had sent blank absentee ballot request forms with instructions on how to fill them out correctly. Instead, Hall told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that the group bombarded the state with mailers before researching the state's laws.\u00a0 The NCSBE said that county boards of elections that receive invalid absentee request forms will send a letter to the voter that informs them of the issue and includes a blank request form for the voter to return. \"It is confusing and just a lot of headache in a time when [election] officials need to be doing other things,\" said Hall, who added that the state's election laws also need reform. \"Our law does need to change to make voting more accessible and fair in this environment...\" CVI complained that the state law is \"poorly worded\" and said, \"CVI believed that it was complying with the new law, and had received written assurances from the state regarding its mailing.\" The group said it had, \"as a convenience,\" filled in the names and addresses of the 80,000 North Carolina residents, \"as is common and legal in most states.\" It announced in a statement Wednesday that it is now \"mailing blank absentee-ballot request forms to 80,000 North Carolina residents\" to replace the invalid forms.\u00a0 WISCONSIN A federal Judge in Wisconsin rejected a Republican request to dismiss a Democratic National Committee lawsuit seeking to change the state's elections in August and November, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. This is a continuation of a case that was initially filed before the April election in Wisconsin with an updated complaint.\u00a0 Democrats are asking for some changes to those elections, including extending deadlines for registering to vote, changing the deadline for when ballots need to be received and scrapping photo ID and witness signature requirements for some voters.\u00a0 Judge William Conley, who handled the case leading up to the April election and allowed absentee ballots to be returned until 6 days after the election, set a hearing date for June 29 and indicated he wants a quick decision. \"As was amply demonstrated in the fire drill leading up to the April election, the longer this court delays, the less likely constitutional relief to voters is going to be effective and the more likely that \u00a0relief may cause voter confusion and burden election officials charged with its administration,\" Conley wrote.\u00a0 CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE GEORGIA Two of the\u00a0most vulnerable and highly targeted freshman Democrats\u00a0have their opponents after Tuesday night's primaries, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In Georgia's 6th, Republican Karen Handel is set for a rematch with incumbent Democrat Lucy McBath. Handel held the seat for 18 months after a 2017 special election, but McBath defeated her by 1 point the next year. While Handel was seen as the front runner going into Tuesday, her win also marked another Republican female candidate making it past the primaries.\u00a0 There are only 11 women House Republicans running for re-election, and the Republican House campaign arm and groups like Representative Elise Stefanik's leadership PAC, E-PAC, have\u00a0been looking to add to those ranks. E-PAC said Tuesday that 11 of their 12 endorsed candidates made it past their primaries. Nearby in Georgia's 7th, Democrat Carolyn Bordeaux and Republican Dr. Richard McCormick will face off in the general. This district had problems with voting machines at precincts in Gwinnett County, the more diverse and Democrat-friendly part of the district.\u00a0 Bourdeaux called for the resignation of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Tuesday and also asked for Governor Brian Kemp to create a non-partisan commission to rebuild the state's voting infrastructure.\u00a0 \"While the Democratic turnout was a highlight of election day, we also witnessed yet another tragic example of our state's failure to administer safe, fair and efficient elections. There is no excuse for this,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0 SOUTH CAROLINA In South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, incumbent Joe Cunningham, a Democrat, will be facing Republican state representative Nancy Mace. Mace\u00a0blew past her primary\u00a0with more than 57% of the vote, and will try to flip this Lowcountry seat that President Trump won by double digits in 2016 and Cunningham flipped by 2 points in 2018.\u00a0 Republicans and Mace will look to label Cunningham as a \"phony\" that has voted consistently with the Democratic leadership. \"Nancy Mace will expose Cunningham as the fraud that he is and end his fake moderate fa\u00e7ade for good,\" Congressional Leadership Fund president Dan Conston said in a statement. Cunningham has a huge fundraising advantage, and Democrats will look to his work with banning offshore drilling and his ranking as the\u00a0most bipartisan freshman by the Lugar Center. WISCONSIN Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore, an African American woman who represents Milwaukee, said Wednesday it would be \"excellent\" for Biden to pick an African American woman as his running mate, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 \"Having an African American woman be nominated for Vice President would be excellent, as long as it's not me,\" Moore told reporters on Wednesday. \"I think that a vice presidential candidate, not just an African-American, but a woman, is going to stimulate those bases that that will bring out the vote. And African-American women are the most loyal parts of the African-American base. And I think we're also the workers in the party. So we'll work to get the vote out.\" Moore noted that African American turnout surged during the Obama years and said she thinks the women who are reportedly being vetted for vice president would be \"really stimulating and exciting\" for people. IN THE SENATE In addition to the presidential primary, Democrats in Georgia voted in the Senate primary for a candidate to take on Republican Senator David Perdue in November. Jon Ossoff has a considerable lead, but none of the candidates have received more than 50% of the vote as of Wednesday afternoon, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The top two candidates, Ossoff and Teresa Tomlinson, could compete in a runoff in August.\u00a0 In other states, Senator Lindsey Graham won the GOP primary in South Carolina and will face Democrat Jaime Harrison in November. In West Virginia, Paula Jean Swearengin won the Democratic primary to advance to the general election against incumbent Republican Senator Shelly Moore-Capito.\u00a0CBS News Capitol Hill producer Alan He\u00a0reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met with President Trump Wednesday morning to discuss Senate races.",

Warren, a former public school teacher, delivered her address from an elementary school in Springfield, Massachusetts.\u00a0 The classroom where she gave her remarks was decorated with plenty of \"Easter eggs.\" As she spoke, some viewers caught sight of the children's letter blocks on shelves spelling out BLM \u2014 shorthand for Black Lives Matter. The Democratic senator and former presidential candidate has focused on issues of racial inequality and injustice in the past.\u00a0 When the full classroom was in view, there were other subtle messages sprinkled throughout. Her presidential campaign's Twitter account, Warren Democrats, highlighted a U.S. postal worker's shirt, the date of the November election, and letters of her slogan, DBFH, for \"Dream Big, Fight Hard.\" \u00a0 There was also a trio of block letters spelling out \"JOE\" \u2013\u00a0 a tribute to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.\u00a0 Spotted: Converse (a Massachusetts company!) and @JoeBiden! pic.twitter.com/InQrwioDpL During her speech, Warren praised Biden's plan to provide affordable child care, implement universal preschool and raise wages for child care workers.

CBS Baltimore reports the incident happened Saturday afternoon in Kingsville, Maryland, a semi-rural community about 10 miles northeast of Baltimore.  Police have booked resident Douglas Kuhn with multiple charges, including assault. Neal Houk and his son said they honked their horn at Kuhn, their neighbour, from their pickup truck, which has a large Trump sign in the back, as he was putting a Black Lives Matter sign up in his yard. \"He reached down. He had a shotgun right there, pulled it out and pointed it right at\u2026 and we were in disbelief. Next thing we heard was a shotgun blast,\" Houk told CBS Baltimore. Another neighbor corroborated the story, saying he'd heard a single blast. No one was hurt, and it was unclear whether the round caused any damage to Houk's vehicle, but police tracked down Kuhn as the man accused of firing the shot. They said they found a 12-gauge shotgun on his property and took the 50-year-old into custody. \"We see what's going on in the country, and I really didn't expect it right here at home,\" Houk said. \"To hear the gunshot, we were rattled. I'm shaking just talking about it.\" Houk said he had never met nor even seen Kuhn before. \"People are taking the politics a little too serious,\" said the other neighbor, who wished to be identified only as Todd. He added that he knew at least a couple political signs had been stolen previously from Kuhn's property, but stressed that he believed the response was unjustified. \"For someone to take it that far, you gotta be filled with a lot of rage to go out and put a sign up and carry a 12-gauge with you,\" Todd said. Kuhn is facing multiple assault and reckless endangerment charges and a felony firearm charge. \"Hopefully, this division in the country can get better because it's not good,\" Todd said. If convicted Kuhn faces up to 100 years in prison, but Houk said he doesn't want to see his neighbor face that kind of punishment. He told CBS Baltimore his honking was good natured.",

            "article_content": "The California attorney general has filed misdemeanor gun charges against the husband of Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey\u00a0for an incident in March\u00a0in which he allegedly pointed a gun at Black Lives Matter protesters, CBS Los Angeles reports. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed three misdemeanor counts of assault with a firearm against David Lacey, his office confirmed Tuesday.\u00a0 On March 2, with protesters gathered outside the Laceys' home in Granada Hills, cellphone video showed a man purported to be David Lacey open the front door of the couple's home and point a black handgun, before demanding, \"Get off my porch. Right now. Get off. Get off of my porch. I will shoot you. Get off of my porch.\" At a news conference immediately following the incident, Lacey said that she had received death threats, been followed and had been confronted in public. She said her husband responded to the early-morning protest in fear and that he was profoundly sorry. Both Jackie and David Lacey issued statements on Tuesday. \"The events that took place earlier this year have caused my family immense pain,\" the DA said. \"My husband acted in fear for my safety after we were subjected to months of harassment that included a death threat no less than a week earlier. Protesters arrived at my house shortly after 5 a.m. while I was upstairs. My husband felt that we were in danger and acted out of genuine concern for our well being.\" \"My client and I are disappointed that the Attorney General's Office felt that the conduct at issue amounted to criminal behavior,\" a statement from David Lucey's attorney read. \"We disagree entirely with their assessment, but we have the utmost faith in the justice system, and we are confident that the correct result will be reached.\" Protesters have been holding weekly demonstrations\u00a0outside of Lacey's downtown office and her home for months, calling for her to resign. They say that\u00a0over her tenure as DA she has not done enough to prosecute law enforcement officers\u00a0for misconduct. To date, Lacey has charged one officer, LA County Sheriff's Deputy Luke Liu, for shooting an unarmed man who allegedly struck him with a vehicle during a traffic stop. In that case, Lacey said the use of force was not reasonable, a key factor that often determines whether an officer is prosecuted in a deadly shooting. Lacey\u00a0is running for re-election against\u00a0former San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n in November.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Trump formally accepted the Republican nomination for president on Thursday, closing out the final night of the Republican National Convention on the South Lawn of the White House, where hundreds of people were seated closely together with few wearing face masks in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed more than 180,000 American lives. Using the White House as a backdrop for a political event like no president has before, Mr. Trump said he was \"brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years,\" while warning that Joe Biden would enact a liberal Democratic agenda if elected. \"This election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,\" the president said. Earlier speakers, as well as the president, focused heavily on unrest that has broken out in American cities in recent months, painting a dark picture of criminals running rampant in the streets while sidestepping the underlying racial injustices that sparked mass protests in the first place. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, said that voting for Biden and other Democrats \"creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, to your town, to your suburb.\" Patrick Lynch, the head of the New York's largest police union, said \"Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Democrats want to \"dismantle our institutions, defund our police and destroy our economy.\" \"There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America,\" Mr. Trump himself said later. \"This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to.\" Mr. Trump's acceptance address came as protests continued to roil Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Jacob Blake, a Black man, was\u00a0shot several times in the back by a police officer, and a White teenager allegedly shot\u00a0two people dead\u00a0at a protest days later. Rows and rows of chairs spaced just inches apart were set up on the South Lawn of the White House, where attendees waited in the heat for the president's remarks. Reporters counted roughly 1,900 seats arranged on the South Lawn, with just 50 to 100 seats left vacant during the night's programming. President Trump accepted his party's nomination for president in a lengthy speech that stretched nearly an hour and a half, painting a contrast between his vision for the country and Joe Biden's. \"My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States,\" he boomed from the podium. The address was written primarily by White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, according to Trump officials involved in the process. The president said he stands \"before you tonight honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made over the last four incredible years and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years.\" Mr. Trump, like his daughter Ivanka, began his address by noting the Americans impacted by Hurricane Laura and said he will be visiting those impacted this weekend. Speaking before a crowd of more than 1,800 supporters who gathered on the South Lawn, the president attempted to paint a portrait of a stark choice between himself and Biden.\u00a0 \"This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny,\" he said. \"And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it.\" Echoing the claims of several other speakers across the four-day convention, Mr. Trump warned that Biden \"is a Trojan horse for socialism\" and painted him as a weak candidate who, unable to take on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, will not stand up for the American people.\u00a0 \"He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage,\" the president said of Biden. Mr. Trump insisted that he's kept his promises, although PolitiFact estimates he's broken roughly half of them.\u00a0 \"From the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics: I kept my promises,\" he said. The president listed off some of the promises he has kept, like pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. He also emphasized how he's tried to be tough on China.\u00a0 \"We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 After making the case for his reelection by listing his domestic and foreign policy accomplishments, Mr. Trump attacked Biden's 47 years in office, calling the former vice president's record \"a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime.\" It took roughly 30 minutes for the president to mention the coronavirus pandemic still ravaging the nation. As of the president's speech, 180,000 Americans had died from COVID-19 and there have been more than 5.8 million confirmed cases. The president touted how his administration made sure personal protective equipment reached hospitals, and the nation's case fatality rate. The president also touted the financial recovery package signed into law in the early months of the pandemic, as millions of workers lost their jobs. In contrasting his administration's handling of the coronavirus crisis with Biden's plan to defeat COVID-19, Mr. Trump claimed that a shutdown of the economy proposed by Biden \u2014 if recommended by scientists \u2014 \"would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more.\" \"Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender,\" the president said. The president inaccurately claimed that Biden called his ban on travel from China in January \"xenophobic.\"\u00a0 \"When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died,\" he said.\u00a0 But Biden has not called that specific move xenophobic. He has called the president's handling of China and the virus xenophobic in other respects. The virus had already reached American shores and was spreading across the country by the time of the president's ban on travel from China. The president claimed the U.S. has \"pioneered\" the case fatality rate, or the proportion of people who die after being infected with the virus. But the U.S. does not have the lowest case fatality rate. Chile, Armenia, South Africa, Luxembourg, Argentina and Bahrain are among the countries with a lower case fatality rate.\u00a0 Mr. Trump reiterated his support for law enforcement and claimed that under a Biden administration, \"no one will be safe.\"\u00a0 \"We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble, courageous and honorable,\" he said. \"We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid, they are not able to do their jobs. And those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protect.\" He acknowledged the justice system must hold police officers who commit wrongdoing accountable. He did not, however, make mention of\u00a0Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old Black man who was shot in the back by a police officer in Kenosha on Sunday, or\u00a0George Floyd, a Black man who died in late May after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. Those incidents, as well as deaths and other violence perpetrated against other Black men and women at the hands of law enforcement, have sparked a nationwide reckoning on the need to end police brutality and address racial inequities in the justice system. \u00a0 Mr. Trump stressed that the GOP \"in the strongest possible terms\" condemns the looting, arson and violence that has occurred in Wisconsin and elsewhere and issued a forceful denunciation of the violence in major U.S. cities, including Portland, where he deployed federal law enforcement this summer, Chicago and New York.\u00a0 \"As long as I am president, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity and peace,\" he said. Mr. Trump attempted to paint a grim landscape of the country if Biden wins in November and claimed that if he loses reelection and Democrats win control of both chambers of Congress, \"they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town and suburb in America.\" Tying in the theme of the Republican National Convention, \"Honoring the Great American Story,\" Mr. Trump said that in November, voters \"must turn the page forever on this failed political class\" and with him in office for a second term \"write the next chapter of the great American story.\" The president then laid out the broad contours of his second-term agenda, which includes expanding Opportunity Zones, shifting medical supply chains back to the U.S. and slashing taxes and regulations. Mr. Trump also vowed to create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months and said he would push for more stringent penalties for assaults on law enforcement. Looking to space, the president pledged to land the first woman on the moon and vowed to make the U.S. the first country to plant its flag on Mars. \"This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together,\" he said. Mr. Trump concluded his address by reflecting on the country's trailblazers and looking to what will come in the future. \"For America, nothing is impossible,\" Mr. Trump said as he closed his remarks. \"Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that, for America, no dream is beyond your reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable.\" The president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, was the first speaker of the evening to address Americans on the Gulf Coast who have been impacted by Hurricane Laura, which slammed into Louisiana late Wednesday night. \"Our hearts are with you,\" she said. \"The president will continue to support you every step of the way.\" Trump, a senior adviser at the White House, reminisced about introducing her father four years ago at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and said on the final night of the gathering now four years later \u2014 where she again is introducing him before he delivers a speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination \u2014 \"I stand before you as the proud daughter of the people's president.\" The president's oldest child, Ivanka Trump sought to paint for the American people a picture of the president behind-closed-doors and said while his rhetoric is harsh, Mr. Trump arrived in Washington with the singular focus of making America great again. \"My father has strong convictions. He knows what he believes, and says what he thinks,\" he said. \"Whether you agree with him or not, you always know where he stands. I recognize that my dad's communication style is not to everyone's taste. And I know his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered. But the results, the results speak for themselves.\" Ivanka Trump said the president is \"so unapologetic about his beliefs that he has caused me and countless Americans to take a hard look at our own convictions, and ask ourselves, what do we stand for? What kind of America do we want to leave for our children?\" Reflecting on the president's career in real estate, Ivanka Trump said her father has alway been a builder and is unafraid to buck the status quo in Washington, which she said has served Americans well during the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 180,000 in the U.S. \"The grief, sorrow, and anxiety during this time is felt by us all,\" she said. \"I've been with my father and I've seen the pain in his eyes when he receives updates on the lives that have been stolen by this plague.\" Ivanka Trump said the president \"rejects the cynical notion that our greatest achievements are behind us\" and \"believes in the potential of each individual.\" Citing his decision to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, Ivanka Trump said that while Mr. Trump did not campaign on the issue of criminal justice reform, he undertook the effort \"because he has a deep compassion for those who have been treated unfairly.\" In addition to the issue of criminal justice reform, Ivanka Trump heralded the economic gains under the Trump administration before the coronavirus pandemic crippled the economy, as well as the tax reform package passed by the GOP-controlled Congress in late 2017. She made little mention of Biden and Kamala Harris, and instead focused primarily on Mr. Trump's record across his first term.\u00a0 \"Many of the issues my father has championed are not historically Republican priorities, yet where Washington chooses sides, our president chooses common sense,\" she said. \"Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people.\" She also noted his support for the U.S. military, legislation he has signed addressing human trafficking and decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. \"For the first time in a long time, we have a president who has called out Washington's hypocrisy, and they hate him for it,\" Ivanka Trump said. \"Dad, people attack you for being unconventional, but I love you for being real, and I respect you for being effective.\" Ivanka Trump said across his first term in office, \"Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump changed Washington.\" \"America doesn't need another empty vessel who will do whatever the media and the fringe of his party demands,\" she said in closing. \"Now more than ever, America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House.\" Johnson, a grandmother whose life sentence was\u00a0commuted\u00a0by Mr. Trump, lauded the president for his work on criminal justice reform and thanked him for wiping clean the remainder of her sentence. \"He saw me as a person,\" Johnson, whose case was championed by reality TV personality Kim Kardashian, said of Mr. Trump. \"He had compassion, and he acted.\" Johnson highlighted the president's signing of the First Step Act, which she called \"real justice reform\" that brought \"joy, hope and freedom\" to thousands. \"By the grace of God and the compassion of President Donald John Trump, I stand before you tonight, and I assure you, I'm not a ghost. I am alive, I am well and most importantly, I am free.\" Johnson, a great-grandmother, was convicted in 1996 and sentenced for a nonviolent drug offense. She served nearly 22 years in prison before Mr. Trump commuted her sentence. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal attorney, lamented the recent uptick in crime in New York City, where he served as mayor, and urged voters not to \"let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York\" \u2014 echoing a common argument from Mr. Trump about the unrest in major U.S. cities. Giuliani attacked Biden, casting him as a candidate who lacks principles and as a \"Trojan horse\" for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Referring to the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May, Giuliani said that as calls for police reform grew louder from Democrats and Republicans alike, the possibility of unity \"was very dangerous to the left.\" \"They had a president to beat and a country to destroy, and although an agreement on action against police brutality would be very valuable for the country, it would also make President Trump appear to be an effective leader. They could have none of that,\" Giuliani said. \"So, BLM and ANTIFA sprang into action and in a flash, they hijacked the protests into vicious, brutal riots.\" House Democrats\u00a0passed a police reform bill\u00a0in June, but talks between the parties broke down in the Senate on a GOP-backed proposal, and efforts to reform the nation's police forces remain stalled. \"It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, to your town, to your suburb,\" Giuliani said. \"There is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety for our people cannot be done from your basement, Joe. There's also no question that President Trump will fight with all his strength to preserve the American system of government and our way of life.\" Giuliani said the November election, and a victory for Mr. Trump, will give the president a mandate to crack down on the unrest in Democratic-led cities. \"President Trump, with his boundless love of our country and all our people, his disciplined work ethic, his exceptional ability to inspire and his deep understanding of our system of government and the strength of American values is the man we can trust to preserve and even improve our way of life,\" he said. Ja'Ron Smith, deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of the Office of American Innovation, shared his story of how he turned his life around, worked hard in school, and eventually went on to work for the president of the United States. Smith is one of the few high-ranking Black officials in the Trump administration.\u00a0 \"Growing up, I'd never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes. It took meeting Republicans who shared my values to show me I was wrong,\" he said.\u00a0 Smith shared a rarely seen personal side to the president, insisting that he has shown empathy in the wake of the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police.\u00a0 \"In the wake of the murder of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and LeGend Taliferro \u2014 a moment of national racial consciousness \u2014 I have seen his true conscience. I just wish every American could see the deep empathy he showed to families whose loved ones were killed in senseless violence,\" he said.\u00a0 \"For a New Yorker, he's got a lot of Cleveland heart,\" Smith said of the president. In a 2-minute address, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking from a field in his home state of Kentucky, pointed out that he's the only top party leader on Capitol Hill not from New York or California. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy are from California, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is from New York. McConnell was blunt about why Republicans don't want the District of Columbia to become a state \u2014 because that would likely tip the balance of the Senate to Democrats.\u00a0 \"With two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they've done,\" McConnell said.\u00a0 McConnell suggested Democrats want to control every aspect of Americans' lives, including \"how many hamburgers you can eat.\" Carson opened by extending his condolences to the family of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man who was shot by a police officer in Kenosha on Sunday, as well as others \"who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha.\" He urged Americans to \"come together in love of our fellow citizens.\" \"History reminds us that necessary change comes through hope and love, not senseless and destructive violence,\" Carson said. In turning to the reelection of Mr. Trump, Carson said the president \"believes in the people\" and \"is one of us.\" \"We have a choice,\" the HUD secretary said. \"Do we want big government that controls our lives from cradle to grave or do we believe in the power and wisdom of the people and their ability to self-govern with help from a limited federal government?\" Carson highlighted Mr. Trump's support of historically Black colleges and universities, as well as the Trump administration's work on criminal justice reform, adding that he is the \"most pro-life president in our country's history.\" Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, tried to make the case that Joe Biden would make America \"weak,\" and argued that America standing alone is not a bad thing.\u00a0 \"'Stands alone.' That was the motto my old Army unit, the 506th Infantry \u2014 the original Band of Brothers,\" Cotton said. \"From the Normandy beaches to the Iraqi desert, we fought alongside each other, but we were always prepared to stand alone. And so it is with our nation. We lead the free world. But we'll stand alone if we must to defend America.\" Cotton aimed to contrast Biden's record with Mr. Trump's.\u00a0 \"Joe Biden sent pallets of cash to the ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal,\" Cotton said. \"Joe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem and brokered peace deals in the Middle East. Joe Biden coddled socialist dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism\u2014in America's backyard and around the world. And on the Communist Party of China, there is no comparison.\" Cotton, a China hawk, said the president has been tough on China, and would continue to be.",

            "article_content": "Though a Democrat has won the presidency, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn warned his party is being destroyed by the \"defund the police\" movement that arose over the summer. \"'Defund the police' is killing our party, and we've got to stop it,\" the South Carolina kingmaker said in an interview with CBSN Monday. It was a topic he said he and the late civil rights leader and Congressman John Lewis discussed. \"John Lewis and I were very concerned when these slogans came out about 'defund the police,'\" he said. \"We sat together on the House floor and talked about how that slogan... could undermine the BLM movement, just as 'burn, baby, burn' destroyed our movement back in the '60s.\" \"John would never yell, 'burn, baby, burn;\" John would never say, 'defund the police,' as progressive as he was, and I'm just as progressive as anybody else,\" Clyburn said. He went on to say that \"we just lost Joe Cunningham,\" a South Carolina Democratic House member who lost his reelection bid against Republican Nancy Mace. \"And we lost him over 'defund the police.'\" \"Burn, baby, burn\" was a slogan that emerged during the 1965 Watts riots, chanted by Black people who set cars and buildings on fire. Clyburn said that John Lewis was removed as head of the civil rights group they had founded, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, by \"burn, baby, burn\" proponents. He said they didn't want to see the same thing happen to Black Lives Matter, and he criticized the term \"defund the police\" for its lack of clarity. \"When I talked to my friends about this, and they say, 'that's not really what we mean,' and I say, 'Well, in this business, you've gotta say what you mean, and you gotta mean what you say, and if you have to explain what you mean, you are losing the argument.\" Clyburn went on to say that the nation has always been racially divided. \"What we need to do as a country is learn how to mitigate those factors,\" he told CBSN's Anne-Marie Greene and Vladimir Duthiers, adding that race will always be present. \"Let's just embrace it and do what we can to get beyond it.\" He also talked about the outcome of the presidential election. It's cyclical, he said. \"Donald Trump got elected because\u00a0 people thought we had gone too far to the left.\" Then the nation \"moved too far to the right, and the voters decided to send it back to the left.\" Most believe Clyburn played a pivotal role in Joe Biden's presidential fortunes. His endorsement came days before the South Carolina primary and galvanized Black voters to support Biden after he had suffered losses in the earliest primary states. \u00a0 \"I always knew I was gonna vote for Joe Biden,\" he told CBSN, noting that at Biden had lost in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada before the South Carolina primary. He pointed out that he had worked to ensure that people of color \"would have a say-so in who our nominee would be,\" and his state has an electorate that is more diverse than that of Iowa or New Hampshire, both mostly White. Fifty-six percent of South Carolina's Democratic primary voters were Black this year, and most of them voted for Biden. Clyburn also talked about how his endorsement came about, recalling that he was attending a funeral a few days before the South Carolina debate. \"A lady called me to her side,\" he said, and she \"told me she needed to know who I'd vote for. And when I told her, she snapped her head back, and she looked at me in such a way that I cannot explain, and then she said to me, 'I needed to hear that, and this community needs to hear from you.'\" \"I thought about it all day,\" he continued, \"and I made the decision that I was going to make my endorsement and do it in such a way that the community would hear from me.\"",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama warned social justice activists that using\u00a0\"defund the police\" messaging could derail their attempts for change.\u00a0 The primary goal of the movement, which was popularized in wake of the police killing of George Floyd, is to reallocate some funding away from police departments and into community programs. In an interview on Snapchat released Wednesday, Mr. Obama told \"Good Luck America\" host Peter Hamby that the rhetoric could turn off people, rather than convince them be a part of it.\u00a0 \"If you believe, as I do, that we should be able reform the criminal justice system so that it's not biased and treats everyone fairly, I guess you can use a snappy slogan like 'defund the police' but, you know, you lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you're actually going to get the changes you want done,\" Mr. Obama said.\u00a0 \"But if you instead say, 'let's reform the police department,' so that everyone's being treated fairly, divert young people from getting into crime, and if there's a homeless guy, can maybe we send a mental health worker there instead of an armed unit ... suddenly a whole bunch of folks who might not otherwise listen to you are listening to you,\" he added.\u00a0 \"The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?\" the former president continued. \"And if you want to get something done in a democracy, in a country as big and diverse as ours, then you've got to be able to meet people where they are.\" Progressive Congresswoman Ilhan Omar disagreed with the former president's characterization of the movement.\u00a0 \"We lose people in the hands of police,\" the Minnesota Democrat\u00a0said on Twitter. \"It's not a slogan but a policy demand. And centering the demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country gets us progress and safety.\"\u00a0 Fellow \"Squad\" member, Congresswoman Ayana Pressley of Massachusetts, tweeted her criticism of Mr. Obama's remarks.\u00a0 \"The murders of generations of unarmed Black folks by police have been horrific,\" she said. \"Lives are at stake daily so I'm out of patience with critiques of the language of activists.\" While Mr. Obama didn't take a position on the movement itself, other leading Democrats have. Prior to the election, President-elect Joe Biden said he would not support defunding the police. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told CBSN last month that his party is being destroyed by the \"defund the police\" movement. It was a topic he said he and the late civil rights leader and Congressman John Lewis discussed. \"John Lewis and I were very concerned when these slogans came out about 'defund the police,'\" he said. \"We sat together on the House floor and talked about how that slogan... could undermine the BLM movement, just as 'burn, baby, burn' destroyed our movement back in the '60s.\" Christopher Brito is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.",
