            "article_content": "Over a million Puerto Ricans\u00a0live in Florida, many of them in Kissimmee, where one of the key issues in the 2020 election will be Puerto Rico's recovery efforts. The community is still recovering from the devastating impact Hurricane Maria had on the island, when the storm ravaged Puerto Rico and caused nearly 3,000 deaths three years ago.\u00a0 Mildred Wright, 63, is from San Juan, and is an organizer for the Orlando-based nonprofit Organize Florida. She said the group was one of the first to help the Puerto Rican community to begin organizing after relocating to the area.\u00a0 \u00a0CBS News spoke with volunteers who are from Puerto Rico but have lived in the Orlando area for at least two decades. They described helping fellow Puerto Ricans acclimate to Orlando in the months after the hurricane as a challenging time made more difficult by limited resources and a language barrier. Wanda Ramos remembered that organizations like her group, which was called Vamos4Pr Florida at the time, were already working in the community and knew how to reach out and maximize the resources and assistance they could offer. \u00a0\u00a0\"People were coming here with just a bag, a backpack and a few things. There were people that came here with medical conditions. Many of them ended up at the hospital in ambulances from the airport to the hospital,\" recalled Ramos. \"We were connecting with the pain and the suffering and the sadness of the loss that they had coming here with the hope that they could find some relief so they could start a new life.\" Frank Rivera, 63, remembers that some residents were critical of the Puerto Rican families who had relocated to Florida.\u00a0\u00a0\"There were many people that were saying at the time, they were arriving here and they were going to depend on welfare,\" said Rivera. \"Guess what? They have arrived here and they have become active part of our communities. They have started jobs, they started businesses, they're going to school.\"\u00a0\u00a0And they're organizing within their communities ahead of the November election. In 2016, ahead of the general election, there were more than 2 million registered Hispanic voters in the state of Florida\u201415.7% of the total number of registered voters in the state. \u00a0 Since then, the Hispanic population has continued to boom in Florida and the influx of Hispanic voters correlates with an increase in voter registration among Hispanic voters in the state. As of July of this year, the number of registered Hispanic voters in the state had increased to more than 2.3 million\u2014an increase of more than 350,000 registered voters from the 2016 general election.\u00a0\u00a0\"This election is one of the most important for the people, for the Hispanic people, for the minority people,\" said Wright. She added that there are \"too many things that want to pull us apart. We should not let that happen.\"\u00a0 According to Daniel Smith, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Florida, the Puerto Rican vote in Florida underperforms when compared to naturalized citizens \u2014who unlike Puerto Ricans \u2014 have to go through a naturalization process in order to become citizens and vote.  \"In the midterm 2018 election\u2026less than 50% of Puerto-Rican born who are registered to vote, turned out to vote. Whereas if you look at Cuban-born, Venezuelan-born over 60% turned out the vote,\" said Smith. \"There was a 14-percentage-point gap between Cuban-naturalized and Puerto Rican-born in an election where there was a lot of talk about disaster relief.\" That hasn't stopped either presidential candidate from appealing to this voting bloc. In September, just a few days after the Biden-Harris campaign announced a proposal to provide more infrastructure funding to help Puerto Rico rebuild, President Trump announced nearly $13 billion would go to the island for recovery efforts three years after the storm hit. \u00a0 But a number of Puerto Ricans here feel the president is politicizing the socioeconomic issues of the island and say these funds won't sway them. They also haven't forgotten his disparaging remarks about this island.\u00a0 \"Three years ago, there were people dying in Puerto Rico because of lack of electricity, and lack of water, and lack of proper services that are needed these days just to get by and he forgot about our people back then,\" said Ramos. \"He wanted to sell Puerto Rico instead of working it to building it up.\"\u00a0 On more than one occasion, Mr. Trump has made comments opposing further relief for Puerto Rico. \"The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations,\" the president tweeted in October 2018. \"The U.S. will NOT bail out long outstanding & unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money!\" For Rivera, Mr. Trump's comments are one reason she is voting for Joe Biden.\u00a0 \"I'm voting for Biden. Is he perfect? No, he's not. But I'm voting for Biden because we cannot stand another four years of what we got,\" said Rivera. \"You cannot be humiliated, you cannot be put down by the administration and then turn around and give us $13 billion and think that that is enough to wipe everything clean.\"\u00a0 A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll\u00a0shows Joe Biden has a 20-point edge over Mr. Trump with support from 56% of likely Hispanic voters in the state. With a 5-point drop among this demographic since the summer, Biden is slightly behind where Democrats were in 2016. With 36% support among Hispanic voters in Florida, Mr. Trump has about the same support as he did in 2016.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump often claims black people are better off under his administration, citing record low unemployment numbers for African-Americans. Some black voters in South Carolina, which holds its state primary on Saturday, agree he has made the economy better, but others say his rhetoric has made the country worse for black people.  Mr. Trump's plea to African-American voters has grown stronger as Election Day approaches.  \"I have been working to build an unlimited future for African-American communities,\" he said to a crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina in February.\u00a0 Robert Baker, who works as a corporate trainer in the mortgage industry, agrees.  \"We have, for sure, the lowest African-American unemployment in history,\" Baker told CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan. \"When I saw the economy get better, I noticed my 401K. It's the first thing I said, 401K begins to grow, the stock market is growing.\" Tonya Isaac said she's having a different experience. She works part-time as a home health care aide and is on public assistance. \"You have an endless cycle of when you get this good job, then your rent goes up. Then your food stamps are cut. Then your child care is cut,\" she said. But some experts say it's about more than just the unemployment rate.  \"The gap between white and black homeowners is greater now than it was since before the Fair Housing Act of 1968 when segregation was legal,\" said Adolphus Belk Jr, a professor of political science and African-American studies at Winthrop University. Asked what that housing gap says about the state of the economy for black people, Belk said, \"It's one of the reasons why we have to examine multiple indicators of socioeconomic well-being to get a sense of where people really are.\" A recent poll found 84% of black voters disapprove of Mr. Trump's job in office, and according to a January Washington Post-Ipsos poll, 83% of black Americans believe the president is a racist. Baker said he believes the president has made racist remarks, but does not believe he is a racist. \"I've called white people honky. I ain't racist,\" he said.\u00a0 Isaac, however, said she thinks Mr. Trump is racist.  \"The way that he talks, the way \u2014   the things that he has said \u2026 has pushed people to the point that they feel that they can just say and do whatever they want without any repercussions,\" she said. While Isaac and Baker disagree on who should be president, both are concerned about the obvious deep divisions that exists. Baker said when he told his 13-year-old daughter that he would be interviewed by CBS News as an African-American Trump supporter, she asked him, \"Daddy, is somebody going to want to kill you?\" \"It's \u2014 we're in a bad place,\" he said. Asked what she thought when she heard the story about Baker's daughter, Isaac said, \"It shouldn't be. She shouldn't have to worry \u2026 But the sad truth is, is because of our president, it is a divide.\" Eight percent of black voters voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, according to a CBS News exit poll. Baker was not one of them. He was a never-Trumper who voted for a third-party candidate, but he said he changed his mind when he saw the positive effect the president had on the economy.",

            "article_content": "One Georgia county plagued by long lines resulting from problems with voting machines is keeping polls open for an extra two hours Tuesday in the state's primary election. Georgia's primary election was\u00a0delayed from March 24\u00a0due to the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0but the voting machine problems are unrelated. \u00a0Fulton County, which includes parts of Atlanta, said it will will keep polls open until 9 p.m. after a Superior Court of Fulton County ruling. \"Any voter in line until that time will be allowed to vote,\"\u00a0Fulton County tweeted.\u00a0 Georgia's secretary of state earlier announced an investigation into elections processes in Fulton and DeKalb counties. Gwinnett county also reported long lines due to the voting machines.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports\u00a0Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced last year that the state would be purchasing these machines at a cost of $104 million. Though poll workers are voicing their concerns about the equipment, Raffensperger's office is putting the blame on the workers from individual counties for not knowing how to work the machines. \"Obviously, the first time a new voting system is used there is going to be a learning curve, and voting in a pandemic only increased these difficulties. But every other county faced these same issues and were significantly better prepared to respond so that voters had every opportunity to vote,\" Raffensperger said in a statement. \"The voting situation today in certain precincts in Fulton and Dekalb counties is unacceptable.\" In a statement, DeKalb Board Elections chair Samuel Tillman said the problems are not just limited to a select few counties in the state. \"DeKalb county Voter Registration and Elections Office is experiencing technical issues with the new state-issued voting machines. These issues are being seen statewide and are not isolated to DeKalb county\"\u00a0 Tillman said. While Joe Biden has already clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, Democrats in Georgia are fighting in a highly-watched Senate race to compete against incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue in November. Investigative documentary journalist Jon Ossoff achieved national attention in 2017 despite losing in the special House election in the 6th congressional district that was the most expensive House race in history. He is now in a crowded field of seven candidates. Former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson and businesswoman Sarah Riggs Amico are the two other candidates with high expectations. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the top two finishers will advance to an August 11 runoff election. JOE BIDEN Joe Biden's taped address to those gathered at George Floyd's funeral service Tuesday afternoon was both personal and political,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. No stranger to personal family grief, Biden sought to comfort the Floyd family. \"I've watched with awe as you summon the absolute courage to channel God's grace to show the good man George was, to stir justice too long dormant, to move millions to act peacefully and purposely,\" Biden said. \"We know you will never feel the same again. For most people, the numbness you feel now will slowly turn, day after day, season after season, into purpose through the memory of the one they lost.\" The Democratic presidential nominee also spoke to the political outlook on \"racial justice.\" Biden asked, \"Why, in this nation, do too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life?\" He added \"we cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism.\" In more of his exclusive interview with\u00a0anchor and managing editor of \"CBS Evening News\" Norah O'Donnell\u00a0yesterday, Biden weighed in on COVID-19, Veepstakes, and systemic racism in America. Asked whether he's concerned about contracting COVID-19, Biden told O'Donnell, \"No, as long as I follow the rules that I've been told to follow.\" Biden added, \"It's important that everybody follow the medical and scientific advice that we're being given. This is all about science.\" When asked if the last two weeks have affected how he will make his vice presidential running mate decision and who he will choose, Biden said, \"No, they haven't, except it's put a greater focus and urgency on the need to get someone who is \u2014  totally simpatico with where I am. The one thing that I've learned as being \u2014  the only thing I know a fair amount about is vice presidency. And \u2014  it's really important that, whomever you pick as a vice president, agrees with you in terms of your philosophy of government, and agrees with you on the systemic things that you wanna change.\" On whether he believes there is systemic racism in law enforcement, Biden said, \"Absolutely. But it's not just in law enforcement, it's across the board. It's in housing, it's in education, and it's in everything we do. It's real. It's genuine. It's serious. Look, not all law enforcement officers are racist; my lord, there are some really good, good cops out there. But the way in which it works right now is we've seen too many examples of it.\" More of O'Donnell's interview with Biden will air Tuesday, June 9 at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT during CBS News' \"Justice for All,\" a one-hour primetime special. PRESIDENT TRUMP President Trump suggested without evidence Tuesday morning that an elderly man who was hospitalized after being shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo, New York was an \"ANTIFA provocateur\" who may have been trying to \"set up\" law enforcement,\u00a0according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn. Mr. Trump referenced a segment by the conservative One America News Network that claimed the 75-year-old man, identified as Martin Gugino, was using technology on his cellphone to scan and black out police communications during the protest. The reporter for the network, Kristian Rouz, who previously worked for the Russian outlet Sputnik, did not cite any evidence to back up his claims about Gugino and only referenced a report from \"The Conservative Treehouse,\" a right-wing blog. In his tweet, Mr. Trump claimed Gugino, who is a longtime local peace activist, \"fell harder than he was pushed\" by officers with the Buffalo Police Department during the incident last week and said he was \"aiming [a] scanner\" towards the police. \"No one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise so we are at a loss to understand why the president of the United States would make such dark, dangerous, and untrue accusations against him,\" said Kelly Zarcone, a lawyer for Gugino. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said on Twitter that the city is praying for Gugino's recovery and that the two officers involved deserve due process. Buffalo Police Department declined comment to CBS News due to the impending criminal investigation into the two officers who shoved Mr. Gugino. ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday joined with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Richard Blumenthal to request an investigation into the Trump administration's agreement with six medical supply companies to ship personal protective equipment and other supplies to the United States from overseas, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. \"Project Airbridge \u2014  like the broader Trump administration response to the pandemic \u00a0\u2014  has been marked by delays, incompetence, confusion, and secrecy involving multiple Federal agencies and actors,\" the Democratic senators wrote in a letter to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Warren and Blumenthal in April launched their own investigation into Project Airbridge. They released the information provided to them by the companies involved on Tuesday, but said that it insufficiently addressed questions about where supplies had been sent and their sales prices. \"It is not clear if the project was effective or cost-efficient, or if other alternatives \u2014  such as the early invocation and use of the Defense Production Act to produce medical supplies \u00a0\u2014  would have better alleviated the PPE shortage, saved money, and saved lives,\" the senators wrote.\u00a0 GRETCHEN WHITMER Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was asked if she supports the \"defund the police\" movement in an Instagram Live interview with The Root, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. \"It's really about reprioritizing and rebuilding communities, not just policing,\" Whitmer said. \"That this is really about where do we, where do we prioritize our resources.\" Whitmer said budgets are \"overwhelmingly focused\" on policing and the corrections system and added that budgets should prioritize education, access to transportation and access to health care. Asked if she would support defunding police departments and use those funds for education, Whitmer responded, \"I think you do all those other things. You don't need all the money that's going to the police departments. So, yeah, I mean, the spirit of it, I do support that spirit of it.\" Whitmer added that \"we've got to have the conversation about who are, who are we in this country, how do we rebuild communities\u2026And that's precisely why, you know, everything that we're working on here in Michigan is about setting those priorities, building in equity into our public education system, recognizing that kids in poverty require more resources just to level the playing field.\" In a separate interview with Detroit's ABC affiliate in Michigan, Whitmer said that there needs to be a greater investment in communities. \"What we need to do is have real reforms, yes,\" Whitmer said. \"But it also needs to be accompanied by the kind of investment in communities that, that has for too long been short changed.\" Whitmer later told the Detroit Free Press the \"perhaps the words that I used on The Root were maybe a little confusing, but they have never been other than I support rebuilding communities and rebuilding them in a way that creates real opportunity in an equitable and just manner.\" She continued that she didn't believe police should be defunded, but \"what I hear from all of my friends who are part of this moment and who are leading on the front lines is we have a real need for greater investment in communities,\" and \"we need to rebuild and level the playing field through better schools and better transportation and access to health care and those are all the critical investments that I absolutely support.\"   BLACK LIVES MATTER More than 700 cities and towns spanning all 50 states have held Black Lives Matter demonstrations, extending past the country's traditionally liberal cities and into suburban and rural communities,\u00a0CBS News reporter\u00a0Kate Smith\u00a0and\u00a0CBSN politics reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns\u00a0report. From Greenwich, Connecticut, to Waco, Texas, to Wenatchee, Washington, protesters are tapping into a level of civil engagement that city officials say they haven't seen in decades. The organic nature of the demonstrations in such unconventional areas has the makings of a movement, and political strategists are watching the coalitions emerging from the protests five months out from election day. \"I have been shocked about seeing this biracial coalition of people,\" says Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist based in Georgia, where Amaud Arbery was shot and killed by two white men while out on a jog in February. \"I see more white people in Atlanta marching to the governor's mansion than I see black people...I see more parents I know in suburban areas marching with their children.\" The demonstrations in suburban areas represent a political shift made apparent in the 2018 midterm elections, where voters turned off by President Trump fueled the Democrats' takeover of the House. CBS News exit polling found that 53% of suburban women supported Democrats that year, a six-point swing from the previous midterm. \"I can't think of another moment when so many people have gathered spontaneously, especially to fight for black lives...in a state that has some of the highest racial disparities,\" said Ben Wikler, chairman of Democratic Party of Wisconsin, a key battleground state. PARTY PLANNING Republican National Committee officials are touring the Phoenix area on Tuesday, the latest stop in the GOP's search for a new venue to\u00a0host President Trump's nomination acceptance speech. But while city officials and Georgia's governor greeted party officials\u00a0on Monday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports officials in Phoenix, some neighboring municipalities, and the county spanning the area say they have heard nothing about the visit. Arizona's Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, has done little to publicly campaign for the pick beyond fielding a question on the topic at a\u00a0press conference last week. Instead the bid appears to have been spearheaded by Arizona Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, who has repeatedly\u00a0floated a Glendale venue in her home district and plans to participate in part of Tuesday's tour. \"Well, we do have a bit of an inside track because I talked to someone who talked directly to the president about this and the president said he has an open mind about Arizona and it's definitely in the works,\" Lesko told CBS affiliate KPHO. MINNESOTA FARMING CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In southeastern Minnesota, Dave Mensink, a hog farmer, is bracing for a financial hit as he estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic is costing him $22 to $26 per pig over the next 12 months at current Chicago Mercantile Exchange prices.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says hog farmers in Minnesota, which currently ranks second in the nation in hog production,\u00a0have been impacted\u00a0by meat processing plants being temporarily closed due to coronavirus outbreaks among their employees.\u00a0 Soybean and corn farmers in the state have also had trouble marketing their products as some ethanol plants temporarily ceased operations. MICHIGAN A Michigan conservative activist has filed a federal lawsuit against the state's Secretary of State and 16 county clerks arguing they have not done a sufficient job maintaining voter rolls, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Tony Daunt, who is the executive director of the Michigan Freedom Fund, but filed this case in his personal capacity, argues that one northern Michigan county has more registered voters than adult citizens. Fifteen other counties have more than 90% of adults registered, which far exceeds national registration rates, according to the lawsuit. The suit is asking for any issues to be cleaned up before the November election. A 2018 report from the\u00a0Brennan Center for Justice, which was authored by Michigan's current elections director, found relying on census data as a benchmark for eligible voting population isn't always accurate and some previous lawsuits have included inactive voters as registered voters. A spokesperson for the Michigan Department of State said in a statement to CBS News, \"The suit seeks to gain media attention using debunked claims and bad statistics to delegitimize our elections. It compares old census data and registration numbers that make no attempt to distinguish between active and inactive registration, and asserts the false notion that voter registration rates should be low.\" IN THE HOUSE Senator Bernie Sanders\u00a0endorsed\u00a0two House primary challengers on Tuesday, Cori Bush in Missouri's 1st district and Jamaal Bowman in New York's 16th district. With Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement last week,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports Bowman has been collecting a number of high-profile progressive endorsements ahead of his June 23 primary against 31-year incumbent Congressman Eliot Engel. In a candidate forum over the weekend, Engel criticized Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement of his opponent. \"This is not a dictatorship. This is a democracy. We shouldn't have one person, from high, even though she's a colleague of mine, think that she can anoint whoever's elected to Congress...I'm tried and true, I've been there,\" he\u00a0said. Sanders also endorsed Texas' 10th runoff candidate Mike Siegel and two other House candidates running in open New York seats: Samelys Lopez in the state's 15th district and Mondaire Jones in the 17th district.",

            "article_content": "Ohio's mail-in primary ends Tuesday evening, over a month after Ohio Governor Mike DeWine postponed the state's primary, originally scheduled to take place on March 17. In late March,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the Ohio legislature passed a sweeping bill to address the coronavirus pandemic, which also included extending the vote-by-mail primary to April 28.\u00a0 On Monday, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said 1,975,806 vote-by-mail ballots were requested and 1,458,936 ballots have been cast. \"This is not what any of us had envisioned months ago for how we wanted to run this election,\" LaRose said at a press conference with DeWine. \"But I tell you what. We've risen to the occasion. Ohio's boards of elections, these bipartisan teams of very dedicated and patriotic individuals in all 88 counties, have risen to the occasion.\" In a press call Tuesday afternoon, the Ohio Voter Rights Coalition indicated they had been hearing questions and concerns from voters about casting an in-person provisional ballot. Voters who did not receive their absentee ballot were able to cast a provisional ballot at their county board of elections. Jen Miller, the executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, said the boards of elections \"have been confused themselves\" about a directive to allow people to cast a provisional ballot, but noted that under the timeline, it was difficult. \"They've been set up with a nearly impossible task with the short timeline with such an intensive process,\" Miller said. Mike West, a community outreach member at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, said over 500 people showed up at their county boards of elections, as of 2 p.m. West said voters followed the health protocols at their county's board of elections. He described some of the precautions taken by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, including a line that was marked in six feet intervals and designated cleaners, who disinfected voting booths immediately after a voter left the booth. Mike Brickner, Ohio's state director for All Voting is Local, said Ohio's mail-in primary is a learning opportunity on how vote-by-mail can be further improved for future elections during the coronavirus pandemic. \"We can't predict what's going to happen with this global pandemic, except that we can predict that until we have a vaccine, the virus is going to be here in our communities,\" Brickner said. \"We have to start planning for what the impact is that that's going to be for November election.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Longtime colleague and sometimes rival Hillary Clinton joined Biden this afternoon to endorse him and speak about how the pandemic specifically affects women in America,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 \"Just think of what a difference it would make right now if we had a president who not only listened to the science, put facts over fiction, but brought us together, showed the kind of compassion and caring that we need from our president and which Joe Biden has been exemplifying throughout his entire life,\" Clinton said. She also had some digs at President Trump while boosting Biden, saying, \"Think of what it would mean if we had a real president, not just somebody who plays one on TV.\"\u00a0 For his part, Biden floated several compliments Clinton's way, too, and said at one point that he wished they were instead talking about getting her re-elected. Clinton's endorsement Tuesday could also provide an opportunity to smooth over any remaining tension between the competitive pair.\u00a0Read more here\u00a0about Biden and Clinton's relationship regarding the 2016 election \u2014 and how her loss then is affecting his own campaign strategy on how to take on Mr. Trump in November.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP The Trump campaign responded to Secretary Hillary Clinton's endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden today, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"There is no greater concentration of Democrat establishment than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton together,\" campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \"Both of them carry the baggage of decades in the Washington swamp and both of them schemed to keep the Democrat nomination from Bernie Sanders. President Trump beat her once and now he'll beat her chosen candidate.\" Meanwhile, Vice President Pence's visit to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, meant to highlight the clinic's partnership with the state to help battle the coronavirus, was quickly overshadowed by videos and photos of Pence touring the facility without a mask.\u00a0 In a tweet, Mayo Clinic said it had informed Pence that all visitors and patients must wear a face mask, but within an hour that tweet was deleted. According to pool reports, healthcare workers lined the halls and applause could be heard as the VP walked into the blood and plasma donation center where patients were donating plasma.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says the pool notes indicated Pence was the only one seen without a mask in the building as he thanked workers.\u00a0 Vice President Pence told reporters that he and everyone around him is \"tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis.\" Pence said he is following CDC guidelines which indicate that the mask is good for preventing the spread of the virus by those who have it. \"And since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible healthcare personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you.\"\u00a0 Afterwards, Pence held a roundtable with Mayo Clinic employees and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. \"I just want to say how much we appreciate Governor Tim Walz,\" Pence said at the beginning of his remarks. Last week, Walz announced a partnership with Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota to significantly expand coronavirus testing in the state to about 20,000 per day. Pence added that his visit to Minnesota today was to \"celebrate\" a \"whole of America approach,\" that Minnesota is undertaking. The Mayo Clinic has not yet said why its initial tweet saying Pence had been informed about the mask-wearing policy was taken down. VEEPSTAKES STACEY ABRAMS In her second of six media/live appearances Tuesday, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams joined former Labor Secretary Robert Reich to talk about voter suppression and her ambitions to be vice president.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0notes this was an interesting conversation because during the Democratic primary, Reich praised Senators Sanders and Warren for their progressive policies.\u00a0 In his conversation with Abrams this afternoon, Reich applauded \"Medicare for All\" and universal basic income, and even asked Abrams what her response was to the young and progressive voters who are not excited by a Biden nomination.\u00a0 Abrams without hesitation voiced her support for Biden. \"Joe Biden is a man, not only of integrity, but if you look at the policies he has espoused, the ones he's adopted, the way he's framed this campaign and his plan for leadership, it's first and foremost that he's not going to take anyone for granted. He's not going to take communities of color for granted, he's not going to take young people for granted,\" she said.\u00a0 And, in a possible swipe at Sanders' and Warren's more transformative platforms, Abrams added, \"[Biden's] not going to take progressives for granted. But we also need someone who can get in there on day one and start navigating those spaces and getting, not just the ideas out there, but the policies in place.\" Another interesting exchange took place when Reich quoted John Adams, George Washington's vice president, on the vice presidency, which he disparaged as \"the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his imagination conceived.\" Reich said that when he worked in the Clinton Cabinet he had seen Al Gore frustrated in his role. \u00a0\"I think people often mistake position for power, and they look at titles rather than access [\u2026] And I look for opportunities to not just build up, but to dig deep roots. My interest in serving is that I believe that Joe Biden will be a transformative president for us,\" Abrams said. Abrams, who has been frank in her desire to be vice president, continued to hype her resume today, even citing college experience she had in relation to fighting climate change. \"I interned for the EPA for two summers, working on the issues of environmental justice. I wrote my thesis in college on environmental racism and how we need to address the poorest and least resilient, who face environmental challenges,\" she said. Finally, Abrams commented on today's primary in Ohio and New York's decision yesterday to cancel its primary. She praised Ohio Governor Mike Dewine for swiftly moving the primary, but said more could have been done in preparation, like including paid-for postage in the mailed ballots.\u00a0 She chastised the New York Board of Elections decision and said, \"We may know the end of the story but no one gets to stop us from reading it.\" Abrams made the point that cancelling the primary sends a signal that it's the safest decision to not hold an election. Abrams said that's the wrong message to be sending. ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday announced plans to team up with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a bill to stop large companies and hedge funds from overtaking smaller ones suffering financially from the COVID-19 crisis.\u00a0 \"As we fight to save livelihoods and lives during the coronavirus pandemic, giant corporations and private equity vultures are just waiting for a chance to gobble up struggling small businesses and increase their power through predatory mergers,\" Warren said in a statement.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says The Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act would impose a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions involving companies with over $100 million in revenue, private equity companies, hedge funds, and companies with holding a patent for a product used during the crisis.\u00a0 \"Although antitrust agencies are tasked with defending open and fair markets by stopping anti-competitive mergers, their inability to aggressively take on concentration before the crisis began has further limited the federal government's ability to respond effectively to the pandemic.\"\u00a0 The forthcoming bill would also waive waiting periods and deadlines binding antitrust agencies and order the Federal Trade Commission to establish a legal presumption against mergers and acquisitions that hinder the government's response. Such measures are likely to face strong opposition, particularly in the Republican-controlled Senate, but Warren plans to push for them in the next coronavirus relief package. Warren also continued a push to include an Essential Workers Bill of Rights in the next coronavirus package that would add a set of protections and benefits for those on the front lines of the crisis. She and Representative Ro Khanna, along with five dozen other lawmakers, sent their proposal to the Senate and House leaders. \"Frontline workers \u2014 including health care workers, transit workers, farm workers, grocery workers, domestic workers, and delivery workers \u2014 are risking their lives to keep America running. Congress has a responsibility to protect them and their families,\" Warren said in a statement. LIFE AFTER 2020 KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND The Senate's most vocal champion for believing women in their allegations of sexual assault is standing with Vice President Joe Biden in the wake of Tara Reade's allegation. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who led the fight against then Minnesota Senator Al Franken to resign from the Senate, told Just the News\u00a0Tuesday that she stood by Biden.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0asked\u00a0Gillibrand about allegations about Biden at the time, before the Reade allegation of assault was made public. Her response then was that the Biden allegations \"were very different\" because they were complaints of discomfort, not assault. \"The women who have come forward said they felt uncomfortable. They said they didn't feel it was sexual harassment or sexual in nature,\" Gillibrand said. Reade has accused Biden of forcibly touching and kissing her during her time as his Senate employee in 1993. The Biden campaign previously told CBS News in a statement the allegations are \"untrue\" and that the incidents alleged \"did not happen.\" BERNIE SANDERS A team of former Bernie Sanders senior advisers announced today the launch of \"Future to Believe In,\" a PAC aiming to \"rally the constituencies that supported Sanders' presidential campaigns to defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says the founders include some of Sen. Sanders' most-trusted advisors including Jeff Weaver, Chuck Rocha and pollster Tim Tagaris. The group says it is committed to galvanizing Sanders' base to support Biden.\u00a0 \"Already, the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has demonstrated openness to moving in a more progressive direction in areas such as wages, labor rights, higher education funding and health care. Recently, Biden and Sanders have agreed to jointly convene policy task forces to find even more common ground. Future to Believe In will work with supporters, activists and political insiders to expand these gains,\" the group's press release read. \"Future to Believe In\" was viewed skeptically by some of Sanders' most fervent supporters, who are also fervently anti-Biden.\u00a0 Winnie Wong, also a former Sanders 2020 senior advisor,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Tuesday, \"Nothing like draining the social capital out of a senior citizen who has spent the past 40 years fighting to end poverty with a political sleight of hand just to collect a few six figure checks to keep the hustle moving. Charming.\" SURROGATE SAYS BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT The Democratic National Committee held a press call featuring leaders from Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin to discuss President Trump's policy on China and how a Biden administration would counter China, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Representative Tim Ryan, of Ohio, criticized the Trump administration for\u00a0focusing attention\u00a0in January on the Phase One China trade deal while\u00a0downplaying\u00a0the threat of coronavirus.\u00a0 This criticism added to complaints Ryan, along with Michigan's Democratic state party chair and Wisconsin Farmer's Union President Darin von Ruden, had about China's effect on the economy and agriculture. Ryan was asked how a Biden administration would be tougher on China, and he said that, \"If we're going to compete, Vice President Biden knows that we've got to make those investments into the schools and into the research laboratories and parlay that research into helping businesses grow here in the United States and be able to stay here in the United States and get private capital. But there's got to be a comprehensive industrial policy.\" POLLING THE ROOM PANDEMIC VOTING Two-thirds of Americans expect the coronavirus will significantly disrupt people's ability to vote in November's presidential election, according to a new survey from Pew Research Center. But the political divides still exist as 75% of Republicans say they are confident the election will be conducted fairly and accurately compared to just 46% of Democrats who feel confident in the fairness and accuracy of the November election.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says several states have already moved towards vote-by-mail elections for their primaries and earlier this month officials across the country\u00a0were starting to sound the alarm\u00a0about the November election. Now, 70% of Americans favor allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to, including 44% who strongly support this policy.\u00a0 On Monday, President Trump was asked if they had thought about changing the date of the November election. \"Why would I do that?\" Mr. Trump quipped. He added, \"I never even thought of changing the date of the election.\" Only Congress has the authority to change the date of the presidential election. Mr. Trump's comments came days after the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he thinks the president will be \"kick back the election somehow,\" and \"come up with some rationale why it can't be held.\" STATE-BY-STATE ARIZONA Arizona's secretary of state, Democrat Katie Hobbs,\u00a0posted a statement\u00a0late Monday condemning the state's attorney general, Republican Mark Brnovich,\u00a0for asking the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0to overturn a court's decision blocking restrictions on \"ballot harvesting and out-of-precinct voting.\"\u00a0 In January,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Democrats had persuaded\u00a0an appeals court\u00a0that the laws were violations of the Voting Rights Act. But Brnovich has pushed to appeal the ruling,\u00a0accusing\u00a0\"out-of-state special interests\" for attacking \"common sense voter fraud laws.\" NEVADA In Nevada, Democrats\u00a0moved this week\u00a0to intervene as defendants in a federal lawsuit by \"True the Vote,\" the self-described \"voters' rights and election integrity organization\" seeking to undo the state's all-mail primary.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske's attorneys described the group's suit\u00a0in a court filing Monday\u00a0as \"at most... a policy dispute about the relative merits of in-person voting processes and vote-by-mail processes during a pandemic.\" Earlier this month,\u00a0Democrats had also\u00a0sued Cegavske in state court with own demands over the upcoming contest.\u00a0\u00a0 NORTH CAROLINA The progressive advocacy group People For the American Way hosted a virtual town hall with North Carolina lawmakers Monday evening, as a part of its \"Protect Our Vote: Defending Democracy During COVID 19\" virtual town hall series.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the series, which began with a virtual kick-off featuring Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren last week, will also include town halls in Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia in the coming weeks.\u00a0 PFAW\u00a0is one of 150 organizations that make up the Declaration for American Democracy coalition, which is fighting in part to ensure election security for voters across the country amid the COVID-19 crisis. According to a PFAW representative, the group is actively working with partners in different states to organize the virtual town halls and had been working with these groups before the coronavirus outbreak. During Monday's event, multiple lawmakers highlighted the necessity of ensuring safe and fair elections for voters by providing vote by mail options ahead of the general election in November. \"It shouldn't be a matter of your life or your vote,\" said Congressman David Price of North Carolina.\u00a0 Price called the circumstances around Wisconsin's primary earlier this month a matter of \"tragedy and triumph.\" During the virtual town hall Monday evening, Congresswoman Alma Adams of North Carolina said, \"No American should have to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote. This is especially true for the communities that are most impacted by this crisis\u2014our communities of color.\" She added, \"It's shameful to not allow those most at victim of COVID-19 to not have a voice in how we rebuild our democracy, how we protect our citizens from the worst of this crisis, and how we set a foundation for addressing the next pandemic when it comes.\"\u00a0 WISCONSIN Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, said on Tuesday that he isn't ruling out the chance for Democrats to host an in-person convention in Milwaukee this summer.\u00a0 \"I think at this time it's really impossible to predict what the status is going to be then,\" Fauci told the\u00a0Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"Things looking like they're leveling off in many cities and you have to remember this is a big country and different cities have different dynamics of outbreaks.\"\u00a0 Fauci acknowledged that people are \"anxious\" to \"gradually get back to normal,\" but he isn't sure what the situation will be in Milwaukee when the convention is scheduled to take place the week of August 17. \"If we successfully really suppress the dynamics of this outbreak and Milwaukee is capable of being able to do the kind of identification, isolation and contract tracing that they may be able to do it,\" he said. But, there will \"almost certainly be some degree of extra care and physical distancing\" if an in-person convention takes place, Fauci said. DNC chair Tom Perez\u00a0told reporters\u00a0last week that he expects to hold an in-person convention in Milwaukee. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin (DPW) announced on Tuesday that it will conduct its state convention virtually, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. \"Given the continued public health threat the Coronavirus pandemic poses, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin concluded that it was in the best interest of our members' safety and wellbeing that this year's state convention be conducted 100% virtually,\" DPW communications director Courtney Beyer said in a statement.\u00a0 The coronavirus has forced many state parties to conduct their conventions virtually. CBS News reported last week that\u00a0Texas Democrats\u00a0plan to pull off the largest state convention in the nation virtually. The state conventions serve partly as a pep rally for the party, but are also for conducting party business, like electing delegates to the national convention. Also on Tuesday, the Wisconsin state health department reported that 52 people who voted in-person or worked the April 7 election have since tested positive for the coronavirus.\u00a0 \"So far, 52 people who tested COVID-19 positive after April 9 have reported that they voted in person or worked the polls on election day; several of those people reported other possible exposures as well,\" Wisconsin Department of Health Services spokesperson Jennifer Miller said in a statement to CBS News. During a media briefing Tuesday afternoon, the health department's deputy secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk told reporters that the window for reporting coronavirus cases linked to election participation is closing. \"We're getting to the point where the door would be closing on those and after the first week of May we will no longer be asking that question about the April election. Of course we will ask it as future elections occur,\" Willems Van Dijk said. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE The key results to watch in Ohio's congressional primaries are in the 3rd District, where progressive Morgan Harper is looking to unseat Democrat Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. Harper is one of the several candidates that groups like the Justice Democrats were helping to further grow their progressive ranks in the House.\u00a0 Recent similar races saw mixed results: while Marie Newman was able to beat out incumbent-Congressman Dan Lipinski in Illinois, Jessica Cisneros fell short in her bid against Congressman Henry Cuellar in Texas.\u00a0 In an interview in January with\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, Harper said she wanted someone with a more progressive platform to represent the Columbus-area district.\u00a0 \"It's a lot of people who are ready for a different type of leadership and a more aggressive policy platform that isn't going to be afraid to get things done in Washington,\" she said. \"There is this recognition that what we're doing isn't working.\" Beatty has been backed by the Congressional Black Caucus, which Politico reports is looking to send a sign to other progressive candidates that are trying to unseat CBC incumbents.\u00a0 \"Let me make the message strong and clear: When you attack a hard-working member of the Congressional Black Caucus, we fight back. We are the conscience of the caucus, and we represent people,\" Beatty told Politico Tuesday. Beatty has also had the upper hand in fundraising, with more than $1.8 million raised compared to Harpers' $771K.

            "article_content": "Due to COVID-19, most states are going to see a tenfold increase in mail-in ballots this November. The United States Postal Service is the crucial lynchpin to ensuring those ballots are received and processed on time. That promise is looking bleak. It was revealed on Friday that in late July and early August,\u00a0several U.S. states and territories received a letter\u00a0signed by USPS general counsel warning the windows they currently have in place for vote-by-mail deadlines are incongruent with USPS capabilities - essentially warning states that if they don't change potentially hundreds of thousands of votes could not be counted. In a statement to CBS News, a USPS spokesperson said, \"The Postal Service is well prepared and has ample capacity to deliver America's election mail. However, the increases in volume and the effect of when volumes were mailed in the primary elections presented a need to ensure the Postal Service's recommendations were reemphasized to elections officials.\" CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says USPS cannot mandate a state change its policies, however these letters did made it clear certain timelines currently in place ought to change. \"There is a significant risk that, at least in certain circumstances, ballots may be requested in a manner that is consistent with your election rules and returned promptly, and yet not be returned in time to be counted,\" the letter to Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs reads. In Arizona, a ballot must be received by Election Day to be counted. But the situation is also apparently dire in states like California, where mailed ballots can be returned up to 17 days after Election Day. In the letters, the USPS advised states to encourage residents to register, apply, and fill out mailed ballots as soon as possible to avoid processing backlog. CBS News reached out to every state and territory and can confirm that at least 23 states received guidance to rethink their windows - including the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Colorado. At least two, Nevada and Oregon, were told USPS has adequate time to process their mailed ballots. President Trump told reporters Friday he would be willing to greenlight $25 billion in funding for the U.S. Postal Service, including $3.5 billion toward bolstering mail-in voting efforts, if congressional Democrats agreed to his legislative demands on combating the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic downturn,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. \"Sure if they gave us what we want,\" Mr. Trump remarked. \"And it's not what I want. It's what the American people want.\" In the battleground state of Florida,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that Florida voting records show that Mr. Trump and the First Lady requested absentee ballots ahead of the state's primary election on Tuesday and those ballots were mailed to Palm Beach on Wednesday. This comes a week after the president\u00a0encouraged\u00a0Florida voters to vote by mail in the state. Earlier this week,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reported\u00a0that 2016 Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi also urged voters to register to vote by mail during the first stop of the Trump campaign bus tour throughout the Sunshine State. According to University of Florida Professor Michael McDonald, who specializes in elections, more than 2 million absentee ballots have been requested by Democrats for the general election in November and more than 1.3 million absentee ballots have been requested by Republicans. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris quickly appeared together Friday afternoon to sign documents required to receive the Democratic nomination for president and vice president,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0Tim\u00a0Perry\u00a0report. As she signed, Harris was asked about the floated false birther-ism questions from Mr. Trump. She responded: \"I'm signing this because I'm in this race to win with that guy right there. And we are gonna get it done.\" Biden and Harris were seated at different tables in their new campaign studio at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington, Delaware. The pair did not respond when asked if they have recently been tested for COVID-19. Their campaign also launched a new ad on Friday sharing their call for a 3-month, nationwide face mask mandate. The ad is part of the $20 million dollars the campaign says they intend to spend this week in battleground states. The campaign is also seeing a massive surge in fundraising after announcing Harris as his running mate,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. On Thursday, the Democratic presidential ticket hauled in $48 million in just 48 hours. After the news broke Tuesday that Harris was joining the ticket, a Biden-Harris campaign aide tweeted that the hour of the announcement had been the best single hour of fundraising for the entire campaign. It quickly became the best fundraising day for the campaign so far, too, with the team raking in $26 million in 24 hours, including contributions from 150,000 first time donors. Of the $48 million cash haul over two days, $39 million of it poured in online, according to the campaign, touting its grassroots momentum heading into the final few months before the election. The two-day influx of donations is nearly half of what Biden and Harris' primary campaigns raised in all of 2019 combined. Last year, Harris' bid brought in a total of $40 million before she exited the race. Biden's campaign raised $60 million through December. Harris herself held her first interview since being selected as Biden's running mate with Errin Haines, editor-at-Large for The 19th* News.\u00a0Perry\u00a0reports that Harris praised Biden for her selection saying, \"Joe Biden had the audacity to choose a Black woman to be his running mate. How incredible is that? And what a statement about Joe Biden that he decided that he was going to do that thing that was about breaking one of the most substantial barriers that has existed in our country and that he made that decision with whatever risk that brings.\" Harris added that Biden's historic selection \"pushed forward,\" something that might have otherwise taken decades. During the interview, Harris noted that she is currently the only Black woman in the Senate, and just the second Black woman to hold a seat in the chamber. When asked if there was a Black woman who should take over her seat, if Biden and Harris were to win in November Harris said, \"There are 100 United States senators, this should not just be about California.\" Harris added, \"We should be saying this across the nation because there are so many talented black women and women of color, period, who are who are on that path.\" During a White House briefing Friday, Mr. Trump declined to answer a reporter's question about whether he believes in the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, but defended his decision to endorse Republican congressional candidate from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene has a history of amplifying QAnon and September 11th conspiracy theories, as well as racist and anti-Semitic statements. \"Well, she did very well in the election. She won by a lot. She was very popular. She comes from a great state and she had a tremendous victory so absolutely, I did congratulate her,\" Mr. Trump remarked. Mr. Trump will be visiting his younger brother, Robert Trump, in a New York hospital on Friday, a senior administration official confirmed to CBS News. The reason for the hospitalization is unclear, but he is said to be very ill.\u00a0CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0reports Mr. Trump said Friday ahead of his visit that he's a \"wonderful brother, we've had a great relationship.\" \"Hopefully he'll be all right, but he's having a hard time,\" the president remarked. Robert Trump is about two years younger than the president. Over the summer, Robert Trump requested a temporary restraining order in an attempt to stop a book by Mr. Trump's niece Mary Trump from being published. Her\u00a0memoir, which is about Mr. Trump, was published in July. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he will deliver his acceptance speech for the Republican nomination for president at the White House\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers\u00a0and campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0report, flouting critics who called the location inappropriate for a campaign address. \"I'll probably be giving my speech at the White House because it is a great place. It's a place that makes me feel good, it makes the country feel good,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview\u00a0with the New York Post. He added that he would deliver the speech outside \"on one of the lawns\" so people could practice social distancing guidelines. He said that there could be a \"big group of people\" to attend his address, despite the threat of the\u00a0coronavirus. Mr. Trump's announcement came after the U.S. office of special counsel confirmed federal law\u00a0does not preclude\u00a0the president from delivering his acceptance speech at the White House. \"The president and the vice president are not covered by any provisions of the Hatch Act,\" Erica Hamrick, deputy chief of the office's Hatch Act Unit, said in a letter Wednesday. \"Accordingly, the Hatch Act does not prohibit President Trump from delivering his RNC acceptance speech on White House grounds.\" Mr. Trump was set to accept the nomination in Jacksonville, Florida, but the in-person Republican National Convention events there were\u00a0canceled\u00a0due to the virus. The president had\u00a0moved his speech\u00a0from Charlotte, North Carolina to Jacksonville in June because of coronavirus guidelines set by the North Carolina governor restricting the number of people who could attend the convention. The RNC is still planning three nights of programming for the convention that will feature a combination of live events and virtual livestreams. Mr. Trump will also be featured each day of the Republican National Convention, senior Trump campaign officials told CBS News. Ahead of his White House address, the president will honor doctors, nurses and other frontline workers on one of the nights. The week will feature speeches from Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, plus first lady Melania Trump, who will speak on August 25, according to campaign officials. Vice President Mike Pence will speak on August 26 from Fort McHenry. Other speakers during the week will include Senator Tim Scott and Joni Ernst, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and former ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley. Some of entertainment's biggest names are set to appear at next week's\u00a0Democratic National Convention. John Legend, Billie Eilish, Jennifer Hudson, Common, Billy Porter, The Chicks, and more\u00a0will perform\u00a0during the four-day event that will make the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket official, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The entertainment heavyweights will be joining some of the party's biggest names. Michelle Obama is set to speak Monday night, Bill Clinton will be giving an address Tuesday night and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will speak Wednesday night. Harris is scheduled to accept the party's vice presidential nomination that night and Biden will formally accept the presidential nod on Thursday. Other performers just announced include Leon Bridges, Prince Royce, Maggie Rogers and Stephen Stills. According to the convention planners, the performances will range from renditions of the national anthem and American classics to new songs with the idea of drawing in viewers who may not have tuned in before. The Democrats have been preparing for a largely virtual event since they\u00a0announced\u00a0plans in June for a scaled-back, in-person convention. Forward Majority, a Democratic PAC dedicated to state legislature races, is sounding the alarm about state legislature fundraising gaps. In a memo, they point to the narrative of Democrats at the federal level fundraising significantly, while state legislature Democrat candidates in crucial states are seriously lagging their Republican opponents. \"These expectations of a down-ballot rout in November are divorced from fundraising realities on the ground in the most strategically valuable state chambers, where Republicans could very well maintain their stranglehold on power after the 2020 election if Democrats don't direct more resources to the most competitive challenger races - fast ,\" the memo reads. The gaps are especially prevalent in Florida and Texas, where Democrats are within 9 seats of flipping the state house ahead of redistricting. Vicky Hausman, the group's founder and co-CEO, told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0this fundraising trend happened in 2018 as well, when Congressional Democrat campaigns raised money at a high clip, but it simply doesn't \"trickle down to the most competitive state chambers and races.\" In the next couple months, Hausman said Democrat fundraisers should prioritize state legislature contests, but added there tends to be a bias for Democrats toward federal races and federal power, in contrast with Republicans who \"have long understood that state legislatures are a core foundational piece of our Democracy.\" \"If you want to win in a place like Texas, you don't necessarily need to be outraising Republicans, but you do need to be funding serious campaigns and seriously competing to flip seats that are competitive but still require resources to win,\" she said. Democrats in Florida and Georgia celebrated the 85th anniversary of the Social Security Act being signed into law by hosting virtual events where seniors in both battleground states criticized President Trump for vowing to permanently cut the payroll tax if re-elected, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. Mr. Trump has announced he is deferring payroll taxes to provide economic relief amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, Democratic seniors in Florida and Georgia this morning said that jeopardizing Social Security funds for tens of millions of seniors could be devastating. \"I started working in 1964 and you know what, I'm still working because I'm one of those people that...depends on Social Security to exist, to live and social security has kept millions of older women like me out of poverty,\" said Barbara DeVane of the Alliance for Retired Americans. \"I still have a mortgage. I still work. My birthday is next Tuesday, August 18 -- Election Day in Florida -- and I'm still working to supplement my Social Security.\" Gloria Jenkins, chairperson for the Democratic Party of Georgia seniors caucus, said, \"Millions of seniors in Georgia and across the country rely on social security every day. They need it to pay bills, put food on the table, to help with rent, to pay Medicare premiums, buy medicine and just a sundry of things that we use the money for.\" Jenkins added, \"When Donald Trump was campaigning in 2016, he said again and again and again that he would not touch Social Security. But guess what? He lied.\" According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security is\u00a0funded\u00a0through a payroll tax where employers and employees each pay 6.2% of wages up to the taxable maximum of $137,700 and the self-employed pay 12.4% as of 2020. In Arizona, Republican Congressman Paul Gosar\u00a0joined a rush\u00a0of Republicans this week criticizing a recent hire by the Joe Biden team in the state over old Twitter posts by the staffer, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. The former vice president's campaign did not respond to a request for comment over what the president's supporters in Arizona decried as \"racist, sexist, and anti-cop\" tweets, dating back to 2011 and 2012, by Michael Ramierz, a former Bernie Sanders campaign aide. In recent months, Republicans have denounced old tweets by other Democratic hires out West, from\u00a0another former Sanders aide\u00a0tapped by the Nevada State Democratic Party to a spokesperson\u00a0for Congressman Steven Horsford. Also in Arizona, a state once dominated by GOP victories, Biden has been polling ahead of Mr. Trump - a state he won in 2016 - for months. Now Biden's supporters are trumpeting growing numbers of Republicans vocally opposing the president. Democrats\u00a0recently touted\u00a0an open letter led by former Arizona Republican legislator (and founder of the SkyMall) Bob Worsley criticizing a \"Latter-day Saints for Trump\" event this week. Retired Judge Daniel Barker, appointed twice by Republican governors to Arizona courts, is rolling out\u00a0yard signs and billboards\u00a0to support Biden as part of \"Arizona Republicans Who Believe In Treating Others With Respect.\" After forming the group, in an email to CBS News last month Barker said, \"Our goal is to let other Arizona Republicans know that some of us have had enough of how Trump treats others, and that how one treats others is an important part of being the President of the United States.\" The USPS told California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla that \"the vast majority\" of voters in the state \"should have sufficient time\" to receive, complete and return their ballots for the General Election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. But California was warned that some voters, specifically \"new residents who register to vote shortly before Election Day\" could be disenfranchised. Registered voters in California likely won't be impacted because they are automatically going to get a mail-in ballot. Those ballots will get mailed out to registered voters starting 29 days before the election. This week, Padilla announced that nearly 21 million, or roughly 84% of voters in California, the highest percentage in over six decades, are registered to vote for the General Election. Earlier this summer, Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to codify vote-by-mail into the state's law. It made California the first state in the post-pandemic era to move towards automatically sending all registered voters a mail-in ballot but it also extended important deadlines. Now instead of three days, mail-in ballots can be received up to 17 days post-Election Day, if they are post-marked by Election Day, and still count. The USPS has recommended that voters allow at least seven days for their ballots to be delivered. Counties in California that have the capacity can also begin processing ballots 29 days in advance and with a 17 day window after Election Day, most voters should have plenty of time to receive, complete, and have their ballots processed if post-marked by Election Day. While the deadline to register to vote for an election in California is 15 days before Election Day, the state allows voters to apply in person at a county elections office for a mail-in ballot up to 7 days before Election Day. That's where the USPS raised concerns with Padilla. \"If a voter registers at or near that deadline, and if the election official transmits the ballot to the voter by mail several days later, there is a significant risk that the ballot will not reach the voter before Election Day, and accordingly that voter will not be able to use the ballot to case his or her vote.\" On Friday, Newsom said having the 17 day window period was important at the time because of uncertainties around COVID-19 adding that he didn't \"realize how prescient, not just important that now appears to have been with what I would described as almost vandalism of our postal system.\" Newsom also described current issues surrounded the USPS as \"sabotage\" that he said \"clearly intentional.\" Nearly 10,700 absentee ballots were rejected in Michigan's August primary, the majority of which arrived after the deadline to return ballots, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. According to the Michigan Secretary of State's office, 10,694 absentee ballots were rejected in the election of the record 1,638,596 absentee ballots that were returned. Michigan requires ballots to be returned by the time polls close on Election Day and 6,405 ballots were rejected because they arrived past that deadline. 1,438 were rejected because the voter didn't sign their ballot and 787 were rejected due to a signature matching issue. Overall, about 0.7% of returned ballots were rejected, which includes voters who moved or died before Election Day. A\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0of the March presidential primary in Michigan found about 0.8% of returned absentee ballots were rejected, not including people whose ballots were rejected because they ended up voting in-person. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson renewed her call for the legislature to pass a bill that would count ballots that are postmarked by Election Day if they arrived up to 2 days later and another bill that would require clerks to contact voters if their signature doesn't match one on their registration. The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC) have until Friday night to turn over evidence of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, a federal judge in the Western District of the state ordered yesterday. As of publishing, they had not yet done so, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. The Trump campaign and RNC had sued the Pennsylvania secretary of state and all 67 boards of elections there in late June over the use of mail-in ballot drop-off boxes, arguing that they violate the U.S. and Pennsylvania constitutions because poll watchers cannot be present to verify no fraud takes place. Lawyers for the state had requested that the plaintiffs produce \"documents, data, analysis and communications relating to allegations...concerning potential or actual fraud or voter misconduct.\" The judge ordered them to turn that over or say if they don't have it. Spokespeople for the RNC and Trump Campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Wisconsin's second statewide primaries, which took place Tuesday amid the coronavirus pandemic, went more smoothly than its\u00a0April presidential primary, with\u00a0few reported issues, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. It was far different than the election four months ago, which saw long lines in some cities and clerks overwhelmed by the flood of absentee ballot requests. While Tuesday's primaries for congressional and state legislative seats were a good test for clerks and voters, the number of people voting represents a fraction of what's expected in November. Since 2000, August primary turnout has ranged from about 10% to 25%. Presidential elections in that same time frame have drawn at least two-thirds of the state's voters. \"In November it'll be about three to four times the scale of what we saw [Tuesday],\" said Claire Woodall-Vogg, the executive director of the city of Milwaukee Election Commission. \"[Tuesday] was a good test run, but we definitely have some lessons learned, ways to make it more efficient.\" It appears most voters cast absentee ballots in the August primary. By Friday morning, 603,445 ballots had been returned out of the 907,855 requested, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC). Just over 106,000 absentee ballots were returned in the 2018 primary. Many clerks told CBS News they felt better about handling the increased number of requests compared to previous August primaries, though it put a lot of stress on clerks, especially in smaller municipalities. Woodall-Vogg said there were issues delivering about 270 ballots to voters at the end of June, but the city canceled those ballots and sent replacements.\u00a0Wisconsin Watch\u00a0reported that Wauwatosa had 421 ballots ordered in late June that weren't initially delivered. Other clerks were not aware of widespread issues with absentee ballots not reaching voters before Tuesday. What's not clear yet is how many ballots will be rejected, either because they arrived after the 8 p.m. Central Time deadline on Election Day or for other reasons. A\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0of state data found 1.9% of returned absentee ballots were rejected in April. The lasting images of Wisconsin's April election were the long lines at polling sites in Milwaukee and Green Bay, when the cities could only open a few locations due to a massive shortage of workers. That was not the case Tuesday. Though turnout was lower, more polling places were open, and more election workers were available, but many more will be needed come November.",

            "article_content": "This story is part of a new CBSN series focused on voting rights called \"America's Right to Vote.\" See the previous episode here. Voters like Dontay Phillips are among the most prized of this election cycle. A recent graduate of a historically Black college, Phillips is part of what's become known as the \"Rising American Electorate,\" made up of young voters, people of color, and unmarried women. Combined, these three groups account for 53% of Americans who voted in 2016. And in 2020, turnout among this group could be even higher \u2014 if campaigns succeed in engaging them.\u00a0 \"A lot of us have this kind of like woke mentality, where we're paying a lot more attention to the issues around us. If you really want young people to vote, you're going to have to talk about things that they're interested in,\" said Phillips, who plans to vote by mail in Utah.\u00a0 \"With the incredible energy and commitment to our democracy coming out of the George Floyd protests, we're seeing increased interest in voting and increased interest in learning how to participate in our democracy,\" says Tom Lopach, the president and CEO of the non-partisan Voter Participation Center, an organization helping to register and mobilize this group of voters during the pandemic. \"We are living in a moment. More than ever, where Americans are seeing the direct connection between their lives, their challenges, their opportunities and how government serves them.\" But that doesn't mean these voters are just willing to cast their ballot for just anyone. Corey Prince, an organizer in the key battleground of Wisconsin says African American voters under 50 \"are starting to realize that we don't have to be devoted to a party, that we need parties to be devoted to us.\" Prince complains that he hasn't seen enough engagement from the Biden campaign. \"The voters feel disengaged, they feel unheard. They feel that the issues that are important to them are not on the mouths of the politicians who are trying to be elected or want to be representing the people,\" Prince said. \"We don't owe anything. We've paid that we've paid our debts. And so it's time to be paid back now. And so for people who want our votes, they need to cater to our votes. They need to cater to our issues. They need to listen to the things that we're talking about.\" While turnout among young voters and Asian Americans increased slightly in 2016, turnout among African Americans dropped seven points. Overall, nearly 7% of eligible voters in the Rising American Electorate didn't vote four years ago. (Still, the Brookings Institution points out that Black voter turnout, at 59.6%, was higher than Asian turnout by over 10 points (49.3%) and also that of exceeded Hispanics,\u00a0 (47.6%)) Former First Lady Michelle Obama has focused on urging the Rising American Electorate to turn out this year, pointing out what happened when some opted not to in 2016. \"Four years ago, too many people chose to believe that their votes didn't matter. Maybe they were fed up. Maybe they thought the outcome wouldn't be close. Maybe the barriers felt too steep,\" she said in her speech to the Democratic National Convention last month. \"Whatever the reason, in the end, those choices sent someone to the Oval Office who lost the national popular vote by nearly 3,000,000 votes.\u00a0 In one of the states that determined the outcome, the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct \u2014 two votes.\"\u00a0 But Victoria Sandoval, a 24-year old organizer in Laredo, Texas, a state with one of the largest shares of the Rising American Electorate, believes the reason many in this voting group don't show up is less about apathy and more about access.\u00a0 \"I'm not worried about people not turning out. I'm worried about how accessible this election is going to end up being for people who need to vote, whose voices need to be heard,\" she said.\u00a0 One of the barriers for this group is registration. Members of the Rising American Electorate tend to be transient, moving between election cycles and less likely to own a home, according to data from the Voter Participation Center. These voters are also more likely to live below the poverty line.\u00a0 \"I understand not wanting to engage with the system. But I also think that if every single person who is an eligible voter who feels that way did engage with the system and did vote, our country would look so different,\" said Sandoval.\u00a0 \"I feel like people are aware of the size of the demographic, but I'm not sure if they're aware of the impact,\" says Phillips. \"Depending on how this election plays out, I'm sure people will become more aware of just how influential our demographic is.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The first night of the Republican National Convention closed with a pair of speeches from two South Carolina Republicans \u2014 former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Senator Tim Scott \u2014 who painted President Trump as the candidate who will keep the American dream alive.\u00a0 The two, both politicians of color, also denounced the policies and vision of Joe Biden and Democrats. In separate remarks, Haley and Scott each drew upon their own experiences growing up in South Carolina, Haley as the daughter of Indian immigrants and Scott as a Black man whose family \"went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime.\" \"There are millions of families like mine across this nation, full of potential seeking to live the American dream,\" said Scott, who closed out Monday's festivities. \"And I'm here tonight to tell you that supporting the Republican ticket gives you the best chance of making that dream a reality.\" The South Carolinian senator praised Mr. Trump's economic record and work on Opportunity Zones, an initiative spearheaded by Scott, as well as the president's efforts on criminal justice reform and support for historically black colleges and universities. In seeking to differentiate Mr. Trump from Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, Scott urged voters to \"look at [Biden's] actions, look at his policies, look at what he already did and did not do while he's been in Washington for 47 years.\" Scott also warned that Biden and Senator Kamala Harris, his running mate, \"will turn our country into a socialist utopia\" if elected in November. While Scott urged voters to take a hard look at Biden's record, including his comments on Black people and his work on the 1994 crime bill, he also encouraged Americans to view the upcoming election as more than a race between Biden and Mr. Trump. \"It's about the promise of America,\" he said. \"It's about you and me, our challenges and heartbreaks, hopes and dreams.\" Haley, too, said that come November, voters must \"choose the only candidate who has and will continue delivering\" on the vision of the U.S. where children have equal access to education, entrepreneurship thrives and people are free to worship without fear. \"President Trump and Vice President Pence have my support,\" she said. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, recalled working with Mr. Trump in her capacity representing the U.S. at the United Nations and said under his leadership, \"we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do, we stood up for America and we stood against our enemies.\" \"This president has a record of strength and success. The former vice president has a record of weakness and failure,\" she said. \"Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS, great for communist China, and he's a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain, and abandon our values.\" Haley and Scott were among Republican lawmakers, activists and everyday Americans who addressed voters on the first night of the Republican National Convention. The gathering will continue to Thursday and culminate in Mr. Trump's speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination, for which he was formally nominated earlier Monday. Good evening. It is great to be back at the Republican National Convention. I'll start with a little story. It's about an American Ambassador to the United Nations. And it's about a speech she gave to this convention. She called for the re-election of the Republican President she served\u2026 And she called out his Democratic opponent\u2026 a former vice president from a failed administration. That ambassador said, and I quote, \"Democrats always blame America first.\" The year was 1984. The president was Ronald Reagan. And Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick's words are just as true today. Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first. He has earned four more years as President. It was an honor of a lifetime to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Now, the U.N. is not for the faint of heart. It's a place where dictators-murderers-&-thieves denounce America\u2026 and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills. Well, President Trump put an end to all that. With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do. We stood up for America\u2026 and we stood against our enemies. Obama and Biden let North Korea threaten America. President Trump rejected that weakness, and we passed the toughest sanctions on North Korea in history. Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash. President Trump did the right thing and ripped up the Iran nuclear deal. Obama and Biden led the United Nations to denounce our friend and ally, Israel. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem \u2013 and when the U.N. tried to condemn us, I was proud to cast the American veto. This President has a record of strength and success. The former Vice President has a record of weakness and failure. Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS\u2026 great for Communist China... and he's a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain, and abandon our values. Donald Trump takes a different approach. He's tough on China, and he took on ISIS and won. And he tells the world what it needs to hear. At home, the President is the clear choice on jobs and the economy. He's moved America forward, while Joe Biden held America back. When Joe was VP, I was governor of the great state of South Carolina. We had a pretty good run. Manufacturers of all kinds flocked to our state from overseas, creating tens of thousands of American jobs. People were referring to South Carolina as \"the beast of the southeast,\" which I loved. Everything we did happened in spite of Joe Biden and his old boss. We cut taxes. They raised them. We slashed red tape. They piled on more mandates. And when we brought in good-paying jobs, Biden and Obama sued us. I fought back\u2026 and they gave up. A Biden-Harris administration would be much, much worse. Last time, Joe's boss was Obama\u2026 this time, it would be Pelosi, Sanders, and the Squad. Their vision for America is socialism. And we know that socialism has failed everywhere. They want to tell Americans how to live\u2026 and what to think. They want a government takeover of health care. They want to ban fracking and kill millions of jobs. They want massive tax hikes on working families. Joe Biden and the socialist left would be a disaster for our economy. But President Trump is leading a new era of opportunity. Before Communist China gave us the coronavirus, we were breaking economic records left and right. The pandemic has set us back, but not for long. President Trump brought our economy back before, and he will bring it back again. There's one more important area where our President is right. He knows that political correctness and \"cancel culture\" are dangerous and just plain wrong. In much of the Democratic Party, it's now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country. This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world. We faced discrimination and hardship. But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor. America is a story that's a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress, and make America even freer, fairer, and better for everyone. That's why it's tragic to see so much of the Democratic Party turn a blind eye toward riots and rage. The American people know we can do better. And of course we know that every single black life is valuable. The black cops who've been shot in the line of duty \u2013 they matter. The black small business owners who've watched their life's work go up in flames \u2013 they matter. The black kids who've been gunned down on the playground \u2013 their lives matter too. And their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets. It doesn't have to be like this. It wasn't like this in South Carolina five years ago. Our state came face-to-face with evil. A white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel Church during Bible Study. Twelve African Americans pulled up a chair and prayed with him for an hour. Then he began to shoot. After that horrific tragedy, we didn't turn against each other. We came together \u2013 black and white, Democrat and Republican. Together, we made the hard choices needed to heal \u2013 and removed a divisive symbol, peacefully and respectfully. What happened then should give us hope now. America isn't perfect. But the principles we hold dear are perfect. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America. It's time to keep that blessing alive for the next generation. This President, and this Party, are committed to that noble task. We seek a nation that rises together, not falls apart in anarchy and anger. We know that the only way to overcome America's challenges is to embrace America's strengths. We are striving to reach a brighter future\u2026 Where every child goes to a world-class school, chosen by their parents\u2026 Where every family lives in a safe community with good jobs\u2026 Where every entrepreneur has the freedom to achieve and inspire\u2026 Where every believer can worship without fear and every life is protected\u2026 Where every girl and boy, every woman and man, of every race and religion, has the best shot at the best life. In this election, we must choose the only candidate who has and who will continue delivering on that vision. President Trump and Vice President Pence have my support. And America has our promise. We will build on the progress of our past and unlock the promise of our future. That future starts when the American people re-elect President Donald Trump. Thank you. Good night. And may God always bless America. Good evening, To all of you tuning in and participating in the political process, God bless you. This isn't how I pictured tonight, but our country is experiencing something none of us envisioned. From a global pandemic, to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, 2020 has tested our nation in ways we haven't seen for decades. But regardless of the challenges presented to us\u2026every four years\u2026Americans come together to vote\u2026To share stories of what makes our nation strong, and the lessons we have learned that can strengthen it further for our children and grandchildren. Because while this election is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden\u2026it is not solely about Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It's about the promise of America. It's about you and me\u2026our challenges and heartbreaks, hopes and dreams. It's about how we respond when tackling critical issues like police reform\u2026when Democrats called our work a token effort, and walked out of the room during negotiations because they wanted the ISSUE more than they wanted a solution. Do we want a society that breeds success, or a culture that cancels everything it even slightly disagrees with? I know where I stand, because you see, I am living my mother's American Dream. My parents divorced when I was 7 years old. We lived in a two bedroom house with my grandparents\u2026me, my mom and my brother sharing a room and a bed. My mom worked 16 hours a day to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. She knew that if we could find the opportunity, bigger things would come. I thought I had to use football to succeed in life\u2026and my focus on academics faded away. I failed my freshman year of high school \u2013 four subjects\u2026Spanish, English, world geography, and civics. Trust me, after spending 7 years in the Senate, I know I'm not the only one in Congress who failed civics. But even while I was failing the 9th grade\u2026 my mother always said, \"when you shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you will be among the stars.\" She never lost faith in me, even when I lost faith in myself. Because of her encouragement, I went to summer school and caught up. \u00a0The next year I met my mentor, John Moniz\u2026a Chick Fil-a operator. John saw something in me that I could not see in myself, and started teaching me valuable lessons in life\u2026 Like, having a job was a good thing, but creating jobs would be better. That having an income could change my lifestyle, but creating a profit could change my community! He planted the seeds of what would become Opportunity Zones \u2013 this initiative the President and I worked together on is bringing over 75 billion dollars of private sector investment into distressed communities. I took those lessons to heart\u2026and started putting the pieces of my life together. I realized a quality education is the closest thing we have to magic in America. That's why I fight to this day for school choice\u2026to make sure every child, in every neighborhood has a quality education. I don't care if it's a public, private, charter, virtual or home school. When a parent has a choice, their kid has a better chance. And the President has fought alongside me on that. Later in life, I started my own successful small business. That's why I know it is critical for us to have a tax code that encourages growth. We actually saw revenues to the Treasury increase after we lowered taxes in 2017. Rest assured, Democrats do not want you to know that! After starting my business and spending time in local government, I ran for Congress in 2010. The district is based in Charleston, South Carolina\u2026where the Civil War started\u2026against a son of our legendary Senator, Strom Thurmond. You may be asking yourself how does a poor black kid\u2026from a single parent household\u2026run and win a race in a crowded Republican primary against a Thurmond? Because of the evolution of the heart, in an overwhelmingly white district... the voters judged me on the content of my character, not the color of my skin. We live in a world that only wants you to believe in the bad news\u2026 racially, economically and culturally-polarizing news. The truth is, our nation's arc always bends back towards fairness. We are not fully where we want to be\u2026but thank God we are not where we used to be! We are always striving to be better...When we stumble, and we will, we pick ourselves back up and try again. We don't give into cancel-culture, or the radical -- and factually baseless -- belief that things are worse today than in the 1860s or the 1960s. We have work to do...but I believe in the goodness of America\u2026the promise that all men, and all women are created equal. And if you're watching tonight, I'm betting you do, too. Over the past four years, we have made tremendous progress towards that promise. President Trump built the most inclusive economy ever. 7 million jobs created pre-COVID-19, two thirds of which went to women, African-Americans and Hispanics. The first new, major effort to tackle poverty in a generation \u2013 Opportunity Zones. We put hard earned tax dollars back in people's pockets by cutting their taxes, especially for single parent households like the one I grew up in - cutting single mother's taxes 70% on average. President Trump supported these tax cuts for those single moms, and other working families, and signed these policies into law...and our nation is better off for it. So, I'm going to ask you\u2026the American people\u2026not to look simply at what the candidates say...but to look back at what they've done. This election is about your future, and it's critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden said if a black man didn't vote for him, he wasn't truly black. Joe Biden said black people are a monolithic community. Joe Biden said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids. And while his words are one thing, his actions take it to a whole new level. In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of black Americans behind bars... President Trump's criminal justice reform law fixed many of the disparities Biden created and made our system more fair and just for all Americans. Joe Biden failed our nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities... heaping blame on them as they fought to ensure our young folks had access to higher education. Once again, to clean up Joe Biden's mess, President Trump signed into law historically high funding for HBCUs, as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever! And now, Joe Biden wants to come for your pocketbooks.... Unless you're a blue state millionaire. I'm serious \u2013 that's one of their solutions for the pandemic. They want more money you're your pocket\u2026going to help Manhattan elites and Hollywood moguls get a tax break. Republicans, however, passed President Trump's once-in-a-generation tax reform bill that lowered taxes for single moms, working families and those in need. So, when it comes to what Joe Biden says he'll do...Look at his actions. Look at his policies. Look at what he already did and did not do while he's been in Washington for 47 years. Ladies and gentlemen, people don't always see those failures, because they think we're having a policy debate on two sides of an issue. That is not what is happening. Our side is working on policy \u2013 while Joe Biden's radical Democrats are trying to permanently transform what it means to be an American. Make no mistake: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a cultural revolution. A fundamentally different America. If we let them\u2026they will turn our country into a socialist utopia\u2026and history has taught us that path only leads to pain and misery, especially for hard-working people hoping to rise. Instead, we must focus on the promise of the American journey. I know that journey well. My grandfather's 99th birthday would have been tomorrow. Growing up, he had to cross the street if a white person was coming. He suffered the indignity of being forced out of school as a third grader to pick cotton, and never learned to read or write. Yet, he lived to see his grandson become the first African American to be elected to both the United States House and Senate. Our family went from Cotton to Congress in one lifetime. And that's why I believe the next American century can be better than the last. There are millions of families like mine across this nation...full of potential seeking to live the American Dream. And I'm here tonight to tell you that supporting the Republican ticket gives you the best chance of making that dream a reality. God Bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.",

            "article_content": "One day after top U.S. officials said Iran and Russia obtained some voter registration data, which Iran then used to send a recent spate of threatening emails to voters, officials in three states targeted in the email scheme say their voter databases have not been compromised. Hundreds of Democratic voters in Florida, Alaska and Arizona received threatening emails Tuesday and Wednesday claiming to have come from the far-right group The Proud Boys, which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights advocacy group.\u00a0 The emails, which were routed through servers in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Estonia and Moldova to obscure their origin, included threats to \"come after\" voters unless they voted for President Trump. Some of the emails included the recipients' home addresses and other personal information. Others included a link to a video showing a computer user appearing to access voters' registration information to fraudulently complete absentee ballots used by Americans overseas. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that Iran had sent spoof emails \"designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump.\" He did not directly reference the emails spoofing Proud Boys accounts. While Ratcliffe confirmed Iran and Russia had obtained voter registration information, he did not elaborate on how the two nations were able to acquire the data, raising questions as to whether systems had been breached or if the information was compiled through publicly available means. \"This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,\" Ratcliffe said. On Thursday, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) issued a joint advisory stating that Russia had targeted the networks of dozens of state, local and tribal governments since late September, and successfully stole data from at least two of them as of October 1. The agencies warned that some of the networks might house election-related data, but said there is \"no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised.\"\u00a0 Officials from elections offices in the three states targeted by the spoofed Proud Boys emails told CBS News there have been no breaches to their voter rolls. Varying degrees of voter registration information is considered public record in all three states. Mark Ard, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of State, said the emails had targeted voters in multiple counties but there \"has been no breach to Florida's Voter Registration database.\" Gail Fenumiai, Alaska's director of the Division of Elections, said the office \"has no evidence from the FBI that the state's voter registration systems have been compromised.\" Sophia Solis, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of State, said Arizona's voter database \"is secure and not affected by incidents reported nationally.\" Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, an email security company that analyzes billions of emails a day, said the company identified 3,000 emails sent to corporate and organizational clients as it researched the campaign. DeGrippo said the messages were primarily sent on Tuesday and Wednesday, and revealed that Proofpoint found some of the emails had been routed through servers in Moldova, a detail that was not previously known. DeGrippo said \"a large percentage of these emails were sent to .edu addresses,\" a detail she said is in line with previous Iranian state-sponsored activities. \"Iran is obsessed with higher education and getting access into higher education institutions. They do campaigns constantly, and they have been doing them against higher education in a concerted effort for probably two years,\" DeGrippo said, citing the so-called \"Silent Librarian\" campaign that targeted hundreds of universities. A spokesman for the University of Florida told CBS News on Tuesday that the emails were sent to 183 accounts on the university's network. She said the use of email for voter intimidation, and the scale of the campaign, was unusual for a state-sponsored operation. \"A hundred is considered very big for a state-sponsored actor. A hundred emails out of a state-sponsored actor is crazy, but the difference here is that this is not [a malware] threat. This is social engineering and disinformation,\" DeGrippo said. \"They're not spreading malware with this. They're \u2026 trying to get people to take a physical action of some kind out in the world and trying to intimidate.\" A spokesperson for Google told CBS News that 25,000 of the emails were sent to Gmail users, and 90% were blocked by the service's automated spam filter. The company said it referred the matter to the FBI. Iran denied targeting American voters. Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesperson for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, tweeted Wednesday that \"Iran does not interfere in other country's elections. The world has been witnessing US' own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own elections at the highest level.\"\u00a0 Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told CBS News most voter registration information is public and available online, and added that he has seen no evidence that voter registration databases were compromised. \"My personal sense is that the emails were much more about lashing out at America, trying to influence our election process and have people lose confidence in that process, rather than being about specific candidates,\" he said. Alperovitch, now the chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, called the speed with which the intelligence community publicly attributed the email campaign to Iran \"unprecedented.\" Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio said Wednesday that the intelligence community's determination that Iran was behind the campaign left him feeling exposed. \"This is just another news story, a cyberattack, but when this dust settles, the people who are in danger are going to be me and my guys, you know, nobody's going to provide security for us,\" Tarrio said. Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert at The Wilson Center, said the direct-emailing effort is the first she has seen from any adversary and said it indicates Iran is \"stepping up its game.\" Such campaigns from foreign actors like Russia and Iran, she said, are aimed at destabilizing the U.S. without expending many resources. \"I don't think any disinformation actor is getting into this game thinking they're actually going to change votes,\" she said. \"Chaos and division in America is much more valuable to them in many ways.\" The U.S. intelligence community and national security officials have warned that Russia, China and Iran would attempt to use cyber capabilities or foreign influence to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, including by using disinformation to sow chaos and division among U.S. voters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security warned in a homeland threat assessment Iran would continue \"to use online influence operations to increase societal tensions in the\" U.S. \"Tehran most likely considers the current U.S. administration a threat to the regime's stability,\" the department warned. \"Iran's critical messaging of the U.S. president almost certainly will continue throughout 2020.\" The intelligence community has also made a series of disclosures to the American public about foreign threats to the election, as well as steps voters can take to mitigate those threats.\u00a0 In August, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina detailed the candidate preferences of foreign actors, with Russia trying to \"denigrate\" Joe Biden and China preferring Mr. Trump wins reelection. Iran, he said, \"seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections.\" \"Iran's efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content,\" he said. \"Tehran's motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump's reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.\" CISA also this week rolled out a \"rumor control\" web page designed to educate voters about potential areas of disinformation, and Chris Krebs, the agency's director, urged voters on Twitter on Thursday to remember \"your vote is secure and we're on watch.\" \"The American voter is the last line of defense in election security,\" he tweeted. \"Keep calm and vote on.\"",

            "article_content": "In an unprecedented Maryland election, three polling centers will be open Tuesday in a special election between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik in a congressional race dramatically reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. Officials have been urging the electorate to vote by mail for weeks, after roughly 484,000 ballots were mailed earlier this month to registered voters in the state's 7th Congressional District to choose a candidate to finish the term of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. He died in October. After thousands of Wisconsin voters waited hours in line outside crowded polling stations for that state's recent primary, Maryland sent ballots to eligible voters weeks in advance to encourage as many mail-in votes as possible \u2014 in a test of how future elections might safely be held during the pandemic. The election initially was going to be an all mail-in vote, but limited in-person voting was allowed after concerns were raised about people who can't cast ballots by mail, including the disabled and homeless. More than 85,000 votes already have been mailed in. Mfume, a 71-year-old Democrat who held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, is trying to regain the office he held before Cummings. Baltimore resident Kyle Baylor said he planned to drop off his ballot with a vote for Mfume at the post office. Baylor cited Mfume's experience. \"He has a more direct approach to politics and policies and how he handles things, and from what I've seen, he seems to care about the issues of Baltimore city, which is something that we desperately need,\" Baylor said. Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4-1 in the majority-black district, which includes a significant portion of Baltimore, as well as parts of Baltimore and Howard counties. Mfume supports stronger gun-control measures, such as reauthorizing a federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2005. He also is focusing on the root causes of crime, like the inability of young adults to find jobs. He has made health care a priority, particularly lower prescription drug costs. \"I believe very much in improving and strengthening Obamacare,\" Mfume said in a recent interview. Klacik, a Baltimore County Republican Central Committee member, generated buzz with appearances on Fox News. Her social media posts last year showing trash and blight in Baltimore prompted a call for her to appear on the network's program \"Fox & Friends.\" President Donald Trump went on to describe the 7th Congressional District in tweets last year as a \"disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live,\" at a time when Cummings was the powerful House Oversight Committee chairman, leading multiple investigations of the president at the time. Klacik, 38, has campaigned on economic development. She wants to help struggling parts of Baltimore through a federal program known as opportunity zones. Supported by Trump, the program focuses on increasing private investment in distressed communities with tax incentives for people who invest in real estate projects and operate businesses in designated low-income communities. \"To me, the only way you're going to lift people out of poverty is with employment, and I think that's what really made me want to run for the seat, because I could see the need for career opportunities, not just jobs but actual careers,\" Klacik said in a recent interview. The winner will serve the remainder of Cummings' term into January. The winner also will run as an incumbent in the state's June 2 primary to be his or her party's nominee for a full term. For the upcoming primary, voters also will be strongly urged to vote by mail.",

            "article_content": "Kenosha, Wisconsin \u2014 Anger over the shooting of a Black man by police spilled into the streets of Kenosha for a second night Monday, with police again firing tear gas at hundreds of protesters who defied a curfew, threw bottles and shot fireworks at law enforcement guarding the courthouse. Many fires were set, reports CBS Milwaukee affiliate WDJT-TV. The southeastern Wisconsin city became the nation's latest flashpoint in\u00a0a summer of racial unrest\u00a0after cellphone footage of\u00a0police shooting Jacob Blake\u00a0\u2013 apparently in the back, as he leaned into his SUV while his three children sat in the vehicle \u2013 circulated widely on social media Sunday. The 29-year-old was hospitalized in serious condition. \u00a0 Multiple fires continue to burn in Kenosha overnight as we enter the second day of protests. Street lights along Sheridan Rd are down and businesses along this stretch are still smoldering. @CBS58 @PauleenLe for the latest at 430am. pic.twitter.com/OUnI87BMWJ Multiple fires in #Kenosha pic.twitter.com/saaua52n7Y The shooting drew condemnation from Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who also called out 125 members of the National Guard on Monday after protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with officers in riot gear the previous night. Evers called a special session of the State Legislature for next Monday to discuss police accountability and transparency, WDJT said. Demonstrators also marched in the state capital of Madison Monday night, reports the CBS affiliate there, WISC-TV. Some chanted, \"This is not a riot, this is a revolution\" and \"white silence is violence.\" Police in Kenosha first fired tear gas Monday about 30 minutes after the 8 p.m. curfew took effect to disperse protesters who chanted, \"No justice, no peace\" as they confronted a line of officers who wore protective gear and stood shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the courthouse entrance. But hundreds of people stuck around, screaming at police and lighting fires, including to a garbage truck near the courthouse. Tensions had flared earlier Monday after a news conference with Kenosha Mayor John Antarmian, originally to be held in a park, was moved inside the city's public safety building. Hundreds of protesters rushed to the building and a door was snapped off its hinges before police in riot gear pepper-sprayed the crowd, which included a photographer from The Associated Press. The shooting happened around 5 p.m. Sunday and was captured from across the street on the video posted online.\u00a0 Kenosha police don't have body cameras but do have body microphones. Police in the former auto manufacturing center of 100,000 people midway between Milwaukee and Chicago said they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute when they encountered Blake on Sunday. They didn't say whether Blake was armed or why police opened fire, released no details on the dispute and didn't immediately disclose the race of the three officers at the scene.  An eyewitness who captured video of the shooting told CBS News that before he started filming, one officer had Blake in a headlock and another was punching him in the ribs. A female officer tased Blake, the witness said.\u00a0 The witness added that Blake scuffled with police before the shooting and that he heard an officer tell Blake to \"drop the knife\" \u2014 although the witness said he never saw Blake holding a knife. The governor said he'd seen no information to suggest Blake had a knife or other weapon, but that the case is still being investigated by the state Justice Department.  Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer retained by Blake's family, told CBS News Blake was in stable condition. Crump said three of Blake's children \u2014 ages 3, 5 and 8 \u2014 were inside the SUV when their father was shot by police. The family was out celebrating one of the children's birthdays. \"These kids, these babies, are gonna have psychological issues for the rest of their entire life,\" Crump said.\u00a0 Crump added that Blake was trying to de-escalate a fight between two other people when officers arrived at the scene, drew their weapons, and tased him. \"We will seek justice for Jacob Blake and for his family as we demand answers from the Kenosha Police Department,\" Crump said in a statement. Crump, who has also represented the Floyd and Taylor families, said Blake's family has asked that demonstrations in response to his shooting remain peaceful.  \"They don't believe violence to be the solution,\" he said. Police didn't immediately confirm Crump's account or that of the eyewitness who spoke with CBS News. The officers were placed on administrative leave, standard practice in a shooting by police. Authorities released no details about the officers and didn't immediately respond to requests for their service records. Evers was quick to condemn the bloodshed, saying that while not all details were known, \"what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.\"  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the officers \"must be held accountable.\"  \"This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,\" he said, just over two months before Election Day in a country already roiled by the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. \"Those shots pierce the soul of our nation.\"  Republicans and the police union accused the politicians of rushing to judgment, reflecting the deep partisan divide in Wisconsin, a key presidential battleground state. Wisconsin GOP members also decried the violent protests, echoing the law-and-order theme that President Trump has been using in his reelection campaign.  Blake's grandfather, Jacob Blake Sr., was a prominent minister and civil rights leader in the Chicago area who helped organize a march and spoke in support of a comprehensive housing law in Evanston, Illinois, days after the 1968 slaying of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  Rachel Noerdlinger, publicist for the National Action Network, told the AP the Reverand Al Sharpton spoke Monday to Blake's father, who called the civil rights leader for his support. Blake's father will speak at Sharpton's March on Washington commemoration on Friday, Noerdlinger said.  Karissa Lewis, national field director of Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations that make up the broader Black Lives Matter movement, said the shooting was yet another example of why activists have called for defunding police departments.  \"There's no amount of training or reform that can teach a police officer that it's wrong to shoot a Black man in the back seven times while his children watch,\" Lewis said in a statement first shared with the AP.  Online court records indicate Kenosha County prosecutors charged Blake on July 6 with sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant was issued the following day. The records contain no further details and don't list an attorney for Blake.  It was unclear whether that case had anything to do with the shooting.  For more than 100 years, Kenosha was an auto manufacturing center, but it has now largely been transformed into a bedroom community for Milwaukee and Chicago. The city is about 67% white, 11.5% Black and 17.6% Hispanic, according to 2019 Census data. Both the mayor and police chief are white. About 17% of the population lives in poverty.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Dozens of voters in a heavily Democratic county in Florida and across several states reported receiving emails on Tuesday purporting to come from a right-wing group threatening to \"come after\" them unless they vote for President Trump.\u00a0 But an examination of the messages, which are now under investigation by state and federal authorities, shows they were sent via servers located overseas, raising questions about their origin amid concerns about voter intimidation just two weeks before Election Day.\u00a0 Democratic voters in Alachua County, Florida, began receiving the email on Tuesday morning, and voters in Alaska and Arizona also reported receiving the message. Early voting began in Florida on Monday. The emails appeared to come from the right-wing group The Proud Boys, and showed a \"from\" address of info@officialproudboys.com. The Proud Boys has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights advocacy group. \"Vote for Trump or else!\" the email's subject line proclaimed. \"We are in possession of all your information (email, address, telephone\u2026 everything),\" the message stated. \"You are currently registered as a Democrat and we know this because we have gained access into the entire voting infrastructure. You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you. Change your party affiliation to Republican to let us know you received our message and will comply. We will know which candidate you voted for. I would take this seriously if I were you.\" While at first glance the email seems to come from an account under the domain of a website affiliated with The Proud Boys, a review of the source code embedded in seven emails reviewed by CBS News shows the message originated from IP addresses linked to servers located in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Estonia.\u00a0 The IP addresses don't establish that the senders are based in those countries, since the messages could have been routed through the servers from nearly anywhere, according to Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. He noted that the messages were sent via a \"cloud infrastructure provider in Saudi Arabia called 'Saudi Executive Cloud.'\" \"It could be that they are simply relaying through this infrastructure,\" Alperovitch told CBS News in an email. \"In fact, given how this email was sent, using their web interface, that's most likely the case \u2014 that the people behind this found a vulnerable server in Saudi through which they can route lots of emails.\" Alperovitch, who reviewed the source code from one of the emails, said that while the emails were sent through overseas servers, \"there is no indication to suggest that it is a nation-state or otherwise foreign campaign.\" \"These types of email campaigns are unfortunately trivial to execute for anyone with an internet connection and a just modicum of technical ability,\" he said. The website officialproudboys.com, first registered in 2017, was offline as of Tuesday, but archival versions show it was a pro-Proud Boys news site that sold merchandise promoting the group. Domain records show the site's owner initiated a domain transfer to a new web host on Monday. The domain's previous registrar, a company known as Ionos, did not respond to questions on Tuesday about the transfer or who might be behind the site. Enrique Tarrio, a Proud Boy leader, said Tuesday that the group wasn't involved, and that he didn't know who sent the emails. He said he's been in contact with the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections, as well as the FBI. Tarrio said he believes the emails were sent by \"somebody that's not very fond of us.\" \"If somebody's trying to intimidate voters, they're probably successful, the damage is done to some people that aren't very media savvy, you know, like a 70-year-old that gets an email like this and is not going to go out to vote,\" said Tarrio.\u00a0 In a statement on Wednesday, an FBI spokesperson declined to say whether the bureau is investigating the emails, but urged voters to report suspicious activity to the\u00a0FBI's tip line. \"Though the FBI's standard practice is to neither confirm nor deny any investigation, we take all election-related threats seriously whether it is vote fraud, voter suppression, or threats from cyber or foreign influence actors,\" the spokesperson said. \"The FBI Jacksonville Division is committed to\u202fsupporting our election security partners throughout the state of Florida, and protecting our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote.\" The Justice Department said through a spokesperson that it is \"aware of reports that threatening correspondence referencing the current election have been delivered to residences in several states,\" while likewise declining to confirm or deny an investigation. \"Voter intimidation is entirely unacceptable,\" the department's spokesperson said. \"If appropriate, the Department will prosecute any civil or criminal violation to the fullest extent of the law.\"\u00a0 Alachua County is home to the city of Gainesville and the University of Florida, making it a Democratic stronghold in a deep-red part of the state. The county voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016 by a margin of 58% to 36%.\u00a0 How the sender connected the email addresses and voter registration status of the recipients was not immediately clear. But under Florida law, much of the personal information on voter registration forms \u2014 including birth dates, party affiliation, email addresses \u2014 is considered public record. Two of the emails shared with CBS News included home addresses of the recipients. One of those recipients said the sender appeared to be relying on outdated information, as he had not been registered at that address for months. Steve Orlando, a spokesman with the University of Florida, told CBS News that 183 people on campus \u2014 students, staff and alumni \u2014 received the email, and the university believes the account was \"spoofed\" to change the sender's name. Orlando said the FBI is investigating the matter.\u00a0 The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a group of attorneys dedicated to combating discrimination, received numerous calls about the email through its elections hotline, with most coming from Florida and at least one from Arizona, Kristen Clarke, the group's president and executive director, told CBS News. At least one man in Alaska also received the message and shared it with CBS News. \"While I am not intimidated by this scam looking email, my elderly mother very much was/is,\" said Debi Martinez, an Alachua County resident who was among the voters who received the message. The Alachua County Sheriff's Office said it and the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections are aware of the email and are working with local, state and federal law enforcement partners to investigate the source of the message, which the elections office characterized as \"voter intimidation.\" \"We're taking it seriously, going through the channels and treating it like obviously the serious thing that it is,\" TJ Pyche, spokesman for the Supervisor of Elections, told CBS News.\u00a0 A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency said it is aware of the reports of the \"threatening emails\" sent to voters. \"While we are looking into the emails, we can tell you this: your vote is secret,\" the spokesperson said, directing voters to a \"Rumor Control\" page on the agency's website.. \"These emails are meant to intimidate and undermine American voters' confidence in our elections. Don't fall for sensational and unverified claims.\" Clarke said voters should be \"on alert\" for efforts to intimidate or discourage them from casting their ballots and said attempts to do so could be unlawful. \"These disinformation campaigns, robocalls, efforts to discourage voters, tend to pop up from time to time,\" she said. \"Our job is to make sure that we track down the source of these efforts and ensure that voters feel free to cast their ballot.\" The messages, which appear to be an attempt to intimidate voters in at least one crucial battleground state to support Mr. Trump's reelection bid, come just two weeks before the general election. While there was not any immediate indication that the emails were part of a state-sponsored interference campaign, national security officials have warned for months that the 2020 presidential election is a ripe target for foreign actors spreading disinformation online, reminiscent of Russia's campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. In August, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina said the intelligence community assessed that Russia is actively working to \"denigrate\" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and boosts Mr. Trump's campaign, while China prefers the president loses his reelection bid.\u00a0 On Sunday, Admiral Mike Rogers, the former head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, said he believes Russia is attempting to spread disinformation on social media and other mediums to sow confusion and discord, including by using false identities. \"What you're watching the Russians do is really double down on the idea of using disinformation via social media and other paths to continue to polarize our nation, to incite violence, to incite hatred and to attempt to pull us apart,\" he said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\" Alachua County was the target of a cyberattack launched by Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, in 2016, though the effort to gain access to the county's election office through a phishing email was unsuccessful.

            "article_content": "About 12 million jobless workers around the U.S. will lose their unemployment benefits the day after Christmas, according to a new analysis. The benefits cutoff could push many households into poverty while creating headwinds for the economic recovery, experts say. Two key government programs authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act expire on December 26. One is the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides jobless aid to freelance and gig workers. That would deprive 7.3 million workers of urgently needed income, according to a study released Wednesday by The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. Another 4.6 million workers face being dropped from Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) benefits, another CARES Act program that provides an additional 13 weeks of jobless aid beyond the typical 26 weeks that states provide, the analysis found.\u00a0 The extra $600 a week in federal unemployment insurance assistance that workers had been getting under CARES lapsed at the end of July, slashing income for many Americans who lost their jobs during the first months of the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. The financial support from government stimulus programs has been credited with keeping many businesses and households afloat as they coped with the fallout from COVID-19 and nationwide shutdowns. The upcoming benefits cliff may prove to be another shock to households and the economy, said The Century Foundation's Andrew Stettner, an expert on unemployment.\u00a0 \"People don't realize that most of the people collecting unemployment benefits now will be cut off on December 26,\" Stettner said. \"Most people will be going from that $200 to $300 a week to nothing.\" He added, \"This is will have a huge impact on families and the economy.\" At the same time, several other pandemic-related programs are due to expire at year-end, which could add to the pressures facing many households. For instance, a moratorium on evictions and a program to provide forbearance on mortgages are also scheduled to expire by the end of 2020.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of workers continue to file new jobless claims each week. Some 742,000 people filed for first-time unemployment benefits for the week ended November 14, the Labor Department\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday. That's an increase of 31,000 from the week before. Another 320,000 people applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program for the self-employed and others who don't qualify for regular unemployment benefits. \"Last week was the 35th straight week total initial claims were greater than the worst week of the Great Recession,\" wrote Heidi Shierholz, a labor economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Center, in a Thursday research note. \"Job growth is slowing. Stimulus is desperately needed.\" The end of stimulus programs would provide a \"real test\" for the economy, according to Oxford Economics senior economist Bob Schwartz. The expiration of unemployment support is coming as COVID-19\u00a0surges across the U.S., sparking new restrictions from states and cities.\u00a0 \"With infection rates spiking throughout most of the nation, so too are more restrictions being put in place, setting the stage for the unemployment lines to swell again,\" Schwartz wrote in a report. \"Unless Congress extends [jobless benefits], a vital source of income for this distressed segment of the population would be extinguished.\" While the unemployment benefits aren't particularly generous \u2014 the typical weekly unemployment check amounts to $333 a week \u2014 out-of-work adults have told CBS MoneyWatch that the additional money has helped them pay for necessities like utilities and rent.\u00a0 Some workers have already reached the end of their unemployment benefits this fall, such as those workers who were among the first to lose their jobs in the spring. About 4.4 million workers will have already exhausted their extra CARES Act unemployment aid before the December 26 cutoff, The Century Foundation estimates.\u00a0 \"I'm stressed out,\" Shawnda Rice, 40, a bartender in Cincinnati, told CBS MoneyWatch last month. The bar where she worked shuttered in March, when she filed for unemployment. \"I don't know where the money is coming from. When the bills came due this past week, I called and asked for an extension.\"\u00a0 Stimulus talks stalled in Congress ahead of the November 3 election. While there are hopes for another round, the size and timing of a measure remain uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he backs another stimulus package,\u00a0noting\u00a0in a press conference earlier this month that he would like an aid deal passed before year-end. President-elect Joe Biden has\u00a0called on Congress\u00a0to \"come together and pass a COVID-relief package.\" Yet any package passed during the so-called \"lame duck\" session \u2014 before the newly elected members of the Senate and the House take their seats in January, along with Mr. Biden \u2014 is likely to be far smaller than the more than $2 trillion sought by Democrats, according to Wall Street analysts.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 For President Trump and top officials in his administration, getting back to normal in the age of the coronavirus\u00a0includes getting back to school. But as the White House begins its push for students to return to classrooms for the upcoming academic year, it's bumping up against opposition from local and state officials worried about the risk posed to students and staff. To ramp up the pressure on school districts reluctant to fully reopening the doors of elementary and secondary institutions in the coming weeks, Mr. Trump has threatened to cut funding to those that are not fully operational for the new school year. \"In Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and many other countries, SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS. The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!\" the president tweeted last week. But Mr. Trump's threat to turn off the spigot of federal dollars flowing to public schools holds little weight, since he lacks the authority to withhold funding that Congress has already appropriated. \"This is Congress's responsibility, and Congress would push back on cuts that affected their states and schools,\" Sean Corcoran, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University who focuses on the economics of education and state and local public finance, told CBS News.\u00a0 Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the Democrat-led House Appropriations Committee, further poured cold water on Mr. Trump's unilateral attempt to use federal dollars as leverage on school districts. \"Congress provides federal education funding to support some of the most vulnerable young people in our country,\" he said in a statement. \"The president has no authority to cut off funding for these students, and threatening to do so to prop up his flailing campaign is offensive.\" Federal dollars comprise a small fraction of revenues that fund public schools, with state and local governments providing more than 90% of the revenue for elementary and secondary schools, according to an August 2019 report from the Congressional Research Service that analyzed data for the 2015-2016 school year, the most recent available. The federal government, meanwhile, provided 8.3% of the financing. The property tax is the primary source of local revenues for public schools, according to the report, while state revenues for school districts are raised from income and retail sales taxes, as well as excise taxes and, in some states, lotteries. \"It's by and large a state and local enterprise,\" Corcoran said. \"The very top line numbers tell us that the federal government plays a very small role in K-12 education.\" But of the federal dollars that fund elementary and secondary education, the bulk \u2014 nearly $16 billion in 2019 \u2014 support Title I grants, which are awarded to schools in low-income areas, Corcoran said, meaning that if the president did have the ability to cut education funding immediately, \"it would have a severe effect on high-poverty places.\" Title I grants are aimed at providing funding to help low-achieving children in the nation's poorest schools, as well as those who struggle with English, who have disabilities or who suffer from neglect. And state and local officials have looked to Congress for more federal aid to schools as some revenue streams have dried up because of the pandemic, straining state budgets. In early May, more than 70 organizations sent a letter to congressional leaders backing state leaders' request for at least $250 billion for education. Congress approved $13 billion for continued education of K-12 students in the $2 trillion economic relief package passed in March, and Corcoran said future emergency aid packages could be a vehicle through which the Trump administration leans on school districts to open, though a divided Congress could complicate those efforts. \"The threats are always an opening move,\" Corcoran said, \"so they may not be able to get away with everything they want, but it could be their starting position and the ultimate package that does get passed has lots of strings attached.\" Even as coronavirus infections soar and hospitalizations rise across the South and parts of the West, Mr. Trump has not wavered in his push for the country to reopen, with back-to-school emerging as the latest focus. The president hosted a roundtable last week focused on reopening the country's schools, during which Mr. Trump reiterated his administration is \"very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else.\" During an event at the White House on Monday, the president again said \"schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school.\" However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers full-sized, in-person classes to pose the \"highest risk\" of spreading the coronavirus, and the healthy agency issued guidance for reopening schools in May that calls for staggered scheduling, grouping students, and spacing desks at least 6 feet apart when possible, among other recommendations. Some school districts are also exploring hybrid models of instruction for the fall, through which students attend classes in-person part-time and virtually. Los Angeles and San Diego Unified School Districts announced Monday students there will not return to campuses when the fall semester begins and instead will participate in online learning. But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is still advocating for a full reopening of the nation's schools for the upcoming academic year and has echoed Mr. Trump's threat to stem the flow of federal dollars to school districts. Last week, during a White House coronavirus task force meeting at the Department of Education, DeVos targeted Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, which is offering two options for students when they return to school in the fall: full-time online instruction or two days of in-person instruction with independent study. \"Fairfax County, which is one of the most well-funded, I would call it an elite public school system in America, offered families a so-called choice for this fall: either zero days in school for their students or two days. And their springtime attempt at distance learning was a disaster,\" she said. \"I give this as an example because things like this cannot happen again in the fall. It would fail America's students, and it would fail taxpayers who pay high taxes for their education.\" In an interview with CNN on Sunday, DeVos said the CDC's guidelines on reopening schools are \"meant to be flexible and meant to be applied as appropriate for the situation.\" \"Kids need to be in school,\" she said. \"They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead, and we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening.\"",

            "article_content": "Miami Gardens, Florida \u2014 Faberna Pierre, 30, a political canvasser and laid-off airport worker, knocked on her 3,000th door this week in this historically black neighborhood north of Miami. She was greeted by an 80-year-old Haitian woman who cracked the door open just enough to hear what Pierre had to say. Pierre greeted the woman in creole, and asked if she'll be voting. She said she would. \"I'm going to mark this house down,\" Pierre told a fellow canvasser. \"She'll need a ride on Election Day.\" Pierre, who arrived in Miami Gardens by way of Haiti when she immigrated with her family when she was 15, was among those who were laid off when the coronavirus ripped through the heart of this working-class black community, located about 15 miles north of downtown Miami. Devastated by the seemingly never-ending pandemic, Pierre turned her struggle to motivation and hit the streets. \"My mother, she's calling her friends. If they need a ride, [she'll] let me know, I'll get someone to drive them,\" she told CBS News. \"We're doing whatever's necessary to get people to vote, because our lives depend on it.\" Democrats in Florida have faced criticism in the weeks leading up to November 3 for focusing on phone banking and not aggressively campaigning in person in this crucial battleground state, which President Trump won by 1.2 percentage points in 2016. Democrats have an edge among those who have voted by mail, according to data from the Florida Division of Elections, but Republicans in the state hold the lead among those who voted early in person. Early voting ends Sunday in the state. The gap between Democratic and Republican get-out-the-vote efforts was one of the reasons Pierre and her union, UNITE HERE, threw their support behind Joe Biden, stepping in to help fill the void. \"Over the phone, they might hang up on you, they might curse you out. But by knocking on doors, you're seeing them face to face,\" said Pierre. \"They're actually talking. I'm pushing my reason for fighting, my reason for voting.\"\u00a0 UNITE HERE is a national restaurant and hospitality union representing 300,000 workers across the country. Ninety-eight percent of UNITE's members were laid off at the height of the pandemic, according to the union. UNITE currently has 300 full-time canvassers working in Florida, and many more volunteers. The union's members, predominantly women and minorities, were among those hardest hit by the pandemic in South Florida, where they formed the backbone of the state's nearly $100 billion tourism industry. \u00a0 Florida International University and the Greater Miami Convention Bureau estimate the tourism industry in Miami-Dade County alone took a $3.4 billion hit due to COVID-19. The unemployment rate in Florida, while not as high as the peak of 14% in the early months of the pandemic, stood at 7.9% in September. \u00a0 The repercussions have reverberated from throughout the industries' staff to reach business owners themselves. On Saturday, Adam Gersten waited outside his popular bar Gramps in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami with a drink in hand, hoping to attract younger voters. Gersten rented a school bus that sits parked out front of his bar, and vowed to transport anyone who wants to go vote. \"There's a drink and a slice of pizza, and a T-shirt we're giving away,\" said Gersten. \"If you take the bus with us, go down to the early voting site close by, vote, turn around and come back, get some free stuff.\" Gersten hit a low point earlier this month when he faced the possibility that he wouldn't be able to keep the doors of his bar open. \"The credit cards were maxed out. There's still no second stimulus. The landlord was saying we kind of have to figure something out now,\" said Gersten. \"There's no tourism. It's already a dark time, and that's when I was saying, 'I think this might be over.'\"\u00a0 Gersten saw both the pandemic and politics playing a role in determining the fate of his business, which is why when he finally did reopen, he found himself motivated to engage politically, showing the presidential debate on the first day back. While Gersten supports Biden, he said his bus was available to anyone who wants to go and vote. \u00a0 \"I feel everyone in our county that cares at all about the future of our country feels the weight of history, and voting, and the intersection of history and voting in our county,\" said Gersten. The CBS News Battleground Tracker ranks Florida as a toss-up, with Biden slightly ahead. The state will be crucial to either candidate's prospects of capturing the White House. \u00a0 \"We keep knocking on those doors. We count every day as it's the Election,\" said Pierre. \"We want the most people to go out there, and make sure that their voice is heard. Because we are suffering here. We are struggling.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Seattle \u2014 A U.S. judge on Thursday blocked controversial Postal Service changes that have slowed mail nationwide, calling them \"a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the Postal Service\" before the November election. Judge Stanley Bastian in Yakima, Washington, said he was issuing a nationwide preliminary injunction sought by 14 states that sued the Trump administration and the U.S. Postal Service.   The states challenged the Postal Service's so-called \"leave behind\" policy, where trucks have been leaving postal facilities on time regardless of whether there is more mail to load. They also sought to force the Postal Service to treat election mail as first class mail.  The judge noted after a hearing that Trump had repeatedly attacked voting by mail by making unfounded claims that it is rife with fraud. Many more voters are expected to vote by mail this November because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the states have expressed concern that delays might result in voters not receiving ballots or registration forms in time.  \"The states have demonstrated the defendants are involved in a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the Postal Service,\" Bastian said.  He also said the changes created \"a substantial possibility many voters will be disenfranchised.\"  Bastian, an appointee of former President Obama,\u00a0 issued a written order later Thursday that closely tracked the relief sought by the states. It ordered the Postal Service to stop implementing the \"leave behind\" policy, to treat all election mail as first class mail rather than as slower-moving categories, to reinstall any mail processing machines needed to ensure the prompt handling of election mail and to inform its employees about the requirements of his injunction.  Postal Service spokesman Dave Partenheimer said the organization is reviewing its legal options, but \"there should be no doubt that the Postal Service is ready and committed to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives.\"   Lee Moak, a member of the USPS Board of Governors, called the notion any changes were politically motivated \"completely and utterly without merit.\"  Following a national uproar, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to President Trump and the GOP, announced he was suspending some changes - including the removal of iconic blue mailboxes in many cities and the decommissioning of mail processing machines.   But other changes remained in place and the states - including the battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada - asked the court to block them. Led by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, the states said the Postal Service made the changes without first bringing them to the Postal Regulatory Commission for public comment and an advisory opinion, as required by federal law. They also said the changes interfered with their constitutional authority to administer their elections.  At the hearing, Justice Department attorney Joseph Borson sought to assure the judge that the Postal Service would handle election mail promptly, noting that a surge of ballots in the mail would pale in comparison to increases from, say, holiday cards.   He also said slowdowns caused by the \"leave behind\" policy had gotten better since it was first implemented, and that the Postal Service in reality had made no changes with regard to how it classifies and processes election mail. DeJoy has repeatedly insisted that processing election mail remains the organization's top priority.  \"There's been a lot of confusion in the briefing and in the press about what the Postal Service has done,\" Borson said. \"The states are accusing us of making changes we have not in fact made.\"  Voters who are worried about their ballots being counted \"can simply promptly drop their ballots in the mail,\" he said, and states can help by mailing registration form or absentee ballots early.  Borson also insisted that the states were required to bring their challenge not in court, but before the Postal Regulatory Commission itself - even though by law the commission has 90 days to respond. Bastian rejected that notion, saying there was no time for that with the election just seven weeks away.  The states conceded that mail delays have eased since the service cuts first created a national uproar in July, but they said on-time deliveries remain well below their prior levels, meaning millions of pieces of mail that would otherwise arrive on-time no longer do.  They also noted some of the effects the changes had already wrought: Michigan spent $2 million earlier this year on envelopes that met election mail standards - only to learn that the Postal Service wouldn't treat them as first class mail. In Madison, Wisconsin, the number of ballots that weren't counted because they arrived late for the August primary doubled from the August 2018 primary.  Further, they cited research from information technology consultant Mynor Urizar-Hunter, who helped start a website tracking the USPS changes, noting that 78% of the machines slated for removal were in counties won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.  The states suing are Washington, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia - all led by Democratic attorneys general.  Pennsylvania is leading a separate multistate lawsuit over the changes, and New York and Montana have filed their own challenges.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders is confident that the tens of millions of dollars he's raised over the course of his campaign has him well-positioned to beat President Trump in November. \"I think we are the strongest campaign to defeat Trump because of the nature of our grassroots movement,\" Sanders said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"We will have more than enough money through individual contributions from the middle class and working families of this country to defeat Trump.\" Sanders heads into Super Tuesday, when 15\u00a0states and territories will vote, with an estimated 56 delegates, two more than Joe Biden, according to the latest CBS News delegate estimate. The Sanders campaign announced Sunday that it raised $46.5 million in the month of February alone. \"We have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday but to take us through the entire process, fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country,\" Sanders said. Sanders has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination following wins in New Hampshire and Nevada and a strong finish in Iowa. The Vermont senator placed second in South Carolina behind Biden on Saturday, narrowing his lead in the national delegate race. Super Tuesday is likely to be pivotal for several of the Democrats still in the race, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who will appear on the ballot for the first time in states voting Tuesday. With a net worth of more than $60 billion, Bloomberg has been self-funding his campaign and vowed to keep his offices open through the general election even if he is not the Democratic nominee. But Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders' campaign, said last week it would not accept financial assistance from Bloomberg, and Sanders said Sunday they believe they can beat Trump in November based on their own fundraising efforts. \"At this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests,\" he said. The Democratic presidential hopeful added that his roster of donors differentiates his campaign from Biden's, as Sanders has received contributions from more Americans than any other candidate in history, with the average donation at $18.50. \"It is not only the amount of money that we raised and that is a phenomenal amount,\" Sanders said of the $46.5 million raised last month. \"It's how we raised it. We don't have a super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions from more than 40 billionaires.\"",

Welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin again this morning with the latest on the coronavirus, as the situation both here and around the world has gotten even more serious. There are now four hundred and sixty U.S. cases of COVID-19, commonly referred to as the coronavirus, in thirty-three states and here in the District of Columbia. Nineteen people have died, sixteen of them in the state of Washington. The governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, joins us this morning from Seattle. Good morning to you, Governor.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Good morning. Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got more than a hundred cases in your state. Starbucks reported one of them in downtown Seattle just a few days ago, four nursing homes now affected. Why haven't you been able to contain the virus?\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Well, look, this is a challenging thing that the whole world is now recognizing, and what we're doing here is the things I think our state should be doing. We're mourning our losses, which have been significant. We are acting based on science and a-- and a commitment for all of us to be soldiers in this battle. And we're-- we are doing that. We've having citizens who are doing what they need to do, which is we're doing teleworking so that we can reduce people being exposed. People are staying home from work when they are ill. And all systems of government, I think, are working as diligently as possible to be very aggressive against this potentially fatal disease. So those are the things are going on. But we should not minimize the task before us giving the transmission. Every single social contact between humans anywhere in the world today is a potential exposure. So we now are making scientific decisions about making sure--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: --we get as much testing as possible, making sure we restock our medical supply chain and making sure that we make good decisions about minimizing those social contacts which we're doing in the state of Washington.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This is supposed to be state led. Do you have all the support from the federal government that you need?\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Well, certainly there were troubles at the beginning of this with the testing protocols. But right now, I believe the agencies of the federal government are being very diligent and helping our state. They are restocking our stockpile of protective equipment and medical supplies. We've had hundreds of thousands of new pieces of supply that come in the last couple of days. That's been very helpful. We need the federal government to really accelerate the production of these-- the ability to do these tests. And we will need the federal government to certify a new system of providing these tests to really ramp up the capability of the independent labs, which ultimately we're going to need. We've-- I'm very glad we started our testing protocol very early to develop our own state capacity. It's gone up by about twentyfold in the last several weeks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But--\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: But to do, nationally, what we need, we really need to get the private sector labs and we need the federal government to help in that regard. I think they are moving in that direction. And we need the federal government to help really vitalize and mobilize our manufacturing capacity to do protective equipment--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: --and we need to do what we did in World War II to mobilize that supply chain.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You are at the epicenter of this. I mean your state is in particular. You saw the dramatic actions--\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --taken in Italy with quarantining a quarter of the country. China, obviously, is an authoritarian state, so it can do things democracies wouldn't. But, I mean, you are in the middle of major industry in a big city of Seattle.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you contemplating-- contemplated shutting it down?\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Well, we don't use that kind of language, but we certainly are contemplating requirements for what we call social distancing in the public health realm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But nothing like what Italy has--\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Which basically means--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --just done overnight.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: We are contemplating, in fact, I'm going to a meeting in about an hour about this subject right now. We are looking at extending what are voluntary decisions right now. And we've asked a whole host of communities to consider whether you really need to have your events right now, and they are being canceled. Comic Con has been postponed. We have a number of school closures. We are contemplating some next steps, particularly to protect our vulnerable po-- populations and our nursing homes and the like. And we are looking to determine whether mandatory measures are required. So far the public is responding very well by making sure that they listen to public health requests. People are now staying home when they are sick. They have telecommuted and teleworked very, very effectively. And so that's working. But we may have to go to the next step. And we are-- we are thinking about those seriously to get ahead of this curve. The difficult decisions I think for the public--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The next step means quarantine?\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Not necessarily quarantine, but reducing the number of social activities that are going on, and we need to make decisions about that looking forward, looking what the modeling suggests the infection rate will be going forward. And this will be or could be hard for the public--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: --because they may not have seen the full wave yet. We need to anticipate that wave, get ahead of it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: We are thinking about stronger measures right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Your local paper, The Seattle Times, reports that even before this outbreak of the virus, your local health systems were pretty taxed. In fact, understaffed, underfunded, and they pinned some blame on you--\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --as governor for declining requests for more public health network funding. Do you shoulder some of the blame here?\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Well, look, our-- our national public health system nationally could always have used additional help, but we've had a lot of things to do in the state of Washington, including financing our schools. We were on a Constitutional obligation to generate about eight billion dollars for our schools. And we've done that successfully. Our public health system has remained stable while I have been governor. But, look, all of us can say generating more support for public health nationwide. We're going to look forward to those issues. I'm pleased that my legislature followed my lead and has now appropriated a hundred million dollars to attack this problem. We're pleased that Congress has acted. And we're pleased that the federal government is helping us right now. We had a good meeting with Vice President Pence here--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: --and his agencies now are responding to our-- our requests.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: So-- and-- and so far, we've had enough tests so far so that everyone--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want-- I want to ask you about that because--\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: --who has been ordered has it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's good news. I want to ask you about--\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --the vice president's visit because he praised your action.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You were very complimentary just now to him. But then the President of the United States had this to say on Friday.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Friday): So I told my-- not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake. Okay, Inslee. Let me just tell you, we have a lot of problems with the governor.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are politics com-- complicating any part of this?\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: Well, we're-- I-- I really don't care too much what Donald Trump thinks of me. And we just kind of ignore that. It's background noise because we really need to work together, Republicans and Democrats. This is a national crisis. We are doing that effectively, as I've indicated. I've had good meetings with the agency directors. I think that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: --the vice president has been helpful in this regard. So, look, we're focusing on people's health not on-- on political gamesmanship right now. And that's what we need to do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: And I feel good about those efforts.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Governor Inslee, good luck to you.\u00a0GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE: You bet.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: As the U.S. steps up efforts to contain the virus we want to take a look at what's happening elsewhere in the world. Cases in France and Italy substantially increased this weekend with the number of people diagnosed in France escalating significantly. And Italy reported more than twelve hundred new cases in the last twenty hours. The increase prompted the Italian government to take dramatic new quarantine measures. CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports from Rome.\u00a0CHARLIE D'AGATA: It's a surreal scene here as St. Peter's Square, even Pope Francis just said it seems a little bit strange, normally, people would be watching his address from his apartment window, instead, the scene, the Sunday prayer being held on these wide screens. It's all an effort to keep crowd numbers down here and as we learned overnight that's just the beginning.\u00a0CHARLIE D'AGATA: It is by far the most dramatic measure, yet, in the race against the virus. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declaring the forced lockdown of a quarter of the country's population. Nationwide museums, movie theaters, sporting events shut down, weddings and funerals banned. The contagion is not only accelerating, it's now everywhere.\u00a0The really scary part is not knowing. You can pick it up from something you touch or someone you might meet. And when people are really worried they come here. This is Italy's number one hospital for infectious diseases. And behind me you might be able to make out those silver tents which have been setup as a sort of triage area.\u00a0They are all over Italy to stop those who may be carrying the virus from infecting the rest of the hospital. And just take a look at the Trevi Fountain this morning. Normally, this place would be heaving with tourists, but hotel cancellations were up by ninety percent in some areas. That's the worst in the world.\u00a0Globally, cases have now soared to a hundred five thousand. South Korea has surpassed seven thousand. Countries across Asia and Europe are all reporting a surge in new cases, and they will be seeing Italy as a glimpse of the future.\u00a0CHARLIE D'AGATA: The media has been criticized for being alarmist, but the media didn't just quarantine around sixteen million people. A couple of weeks ago there may be two dozen cases here and now there are nearly six thousand. This is real. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Charlie D'Agata reporting from Rome.\u00a0One of the nation's top experts in infectious diseases is Doctor Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. He sat with CBS News chief medical correspondent Doctor Jon LaPook for tonight's 60 MINUTES. Two points that he made we thought were important for our viewers. Let's take a look.\u00a0DR. JON LAPOOK (60 MINUTES): Early on the administration was criticized for downplaying the outbreak. On February 2nd, President Trump said we pretty much shut it down coming from China. What's the danger of minimizing the risk of an infectious disease outbreak?\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (60 MINUTES): Well, I mean the danger of minimization on-- on-- in any arena of-- of infectious disease and outbreak is that you might get people to be complacent, number one. Number two, when bad things happen, your credibility is lost, because you've downplayed something.\u00a0DR. JON LAPOOK: In China millions are quarantined. Is that where we are headed here in the United States?\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: I don't imagine that the degree of the draconian nature of what the Chinese did would ever be either feasible, applicable, doable, or whatever you want to a call it in the United States. I don't think you could do that. The idea of social distancing--\u00a0DR. JON LAPOOK: Yeah.\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: --I mean, obviously that's something that would be seriously considered, depending upon where we are in a particular region of the country.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: More of Jon LaPook's interview with Doctor Fauci will air tonight on 60 MINUTES.\u00a0We will be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who is on the Senate Committee that oversees health care. Connecticut is one of the thirty-three states with confirmed cases of coronavirus. Senator, it's good to have you here this morning. And I'm sorry to hear about what's happening in my home state--\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --of Connecticut. How many cases do you think there are right now? There are two that have been reported.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Oh, listen, I imagine we have hundreds, if not thousands of cases in my state. I think we have no concept of the scope of this epidemic, yet, because we have not been able to test. And the fact of the matter is we can't make good judgments about the measures we should be taking in Seattle or in Danbury or Hartford unless we are able to do these tests. And what is unforgivable is that the administration didn't see this coming and didn't put the resources in early to make sure that everybody had these tests available. But we are likely going to have to take much stronger measures as time goes on. But nobody understands where the epidemic is the worst until we get tests widely deployed.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, the administration says there are tests in the pipeline. They said about a million were sent out for delivery, arrival on Friday. Are you seeing that in Connecticut?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: We are not seeing that in Connecticut. We now have private lab capacity to do tests. But our understanding is that we are nowhere near that number that was proffered by the administration last year of a million. We are doing a lot more screening in our state, but we do not have the ability to give a test to everyone who wants one, as the President said was the case on Friday afternoon. And that is incredibly concerning given the fact that we saw this epidemic coming we could have made a decision back in January or February to accept the WHO test that was available to us or start putting serious resources into developing our own test. The administration did neither and they did neither, Margaret, because this President has created a culture of misinformation in which no one wants to give him bad news. And that created a disincentive in the White House and in the administration to come up with an early test.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Doctor Anthony Fauci, who we just heard from and is going to be on 60 MINUTES, said the risk to the average American of contracting the virus is low. And even if they contract it, the risk of a serious outcome is low. So is the anxiety outpacing reality?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, I think that is right, that for each individual American, the risk is still low. But if we do get into a situation where we are taking measures on a city-by-city or state-by-state basis in which there are massive school closures, all of a sudden the effect on the average American is very high. And we are simply not ready to be able to support families if schools are closed for two weeks or three weeks in certain municipalities or certain states. And we could have been doing that planning well before now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been briefed because you sit on this committee. Should we be expecting school closures around the country?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: So I think we need to be prepared for school closures and business closures. And we need to understand that no city is going to take those measures unless there is some assistance from the federal government. So what we should be talking about right now are things like paid sick leave, putting the federal government in a position to be able to assist workers if they have to stay home to take care of a sick child or to quarantine themselves. Instead, we're talking about industry bailouts and tax cuts. We should be talking about assistance for average Americans. And that's not a conversation that's happening.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But that-- how much of that is in the-- the court of the state governments? I mean we're talking about the federal government needing to respond here, but it's governors like Governor Inslee who are on the frontlines needing to react first.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Right. And, listen, the first wave of federal assistance to states will help. The states now have some additional resources to stand up more response efforts. But, again, that money came way too late. We were begging the administration for an emergency supplemental back in February, and they refused to give it. They refused to come to Congress to ask for that money. And I'm glad Congress came to the rescue last week, but that money could have been out the door a lot earlier.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had really sharp words for the Chinese this week. And he said-- he, basically, put some blame on them for not sharing information earlier. And he indicated that is inhibiting the-- the response with the vaccine. Has-- is that real? Is that what's affecting the U.S. response?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, the Chinese early on, were not sharing information. So, that is correct. They have been much more forthcoming since then. But what is inhibiting our response in the United States is in part a President who is lying to the American people, who is telling them that a vaccine is a couple of months away, who is telling everybody that they can get tested if they want. If we really want to talk about what is going to potentially create panic in this country, it's an administration that's just not being straight with the American public about the extent of this epidemic and the real-life consequences that could be put upon Americans.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The-- the administration says that that was just an issue with phrasing on part of the President there. But we'll talk to the surgeon general ahead on the program. I want to ask you about Afghanistan. Another extraordinary week. President Trump had a thirty-five-minute phone call with one of the founding members of the Taliban. They're responsible for the death of thousands of Americans. They harbored al-Qaida. Here's what he said about that call.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Other Presidents have tried and they have been unable to get any kind of an agreement. The relationship is very good that I have with the mullah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The relationship is very good with the mullah. That's an extraordinary statement. You've read the classified parts of this agreement. You can't share the details. But is he-- is he, essentially, right? He got a deal the last administration couldn't. Is this a good one?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: So, I don't think this is a good deal with the Taliban. He had made promises that there wouldn't be prisoner releases. There are reportedly massive prisoner releases as a requirement of this deal. At--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: May not happen.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: At the-- right. May not happen. At the same time, though, I have generally been supportive of the idea of sitting down and trying to negotiate an agreement with the Taliban in which they agree to never again harbor terrorists that may attack the United States in exchange for a phased U.S. withdrawal. What we are doing today is not working. Another twenty years of U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan is not the answer. So I think it was inevitable that the deal this President cut was not going to be as good as a deal that the Obama administration could have cut. But I don't know what the alternative was to having these conversations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for joining us.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And good luck to you.\u00a0We will be right back with the surgeon general for an update on the government's efforts to contain the virus.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is the Surgeon General Doctor Jerome Adams. He is part of the administration's coronavirus task force and the Trump administration's representative on our broadcast today. Doctor Adams, good morning to you.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS, M.D.: Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this cruise ship, Princess Cruises. The operator of that ship and the State of California have now announced some of the plans for the passengers. They are going to dock in Oakland tomorrow on a non-commercial port. The President said on Friday that people-- he-- he would rather people not be let off the ship. The vice president said they would, State of California says they would. Can you clarify what is happening to the thousands of people onboard?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, we'll quickly get into the cruise ships. But what I want the American people to know is that the novel coronavirus is a family-- comes from a family of viruses, including the cold, including SARS and MERS, which we've successfully navigated in the past, and that most people who get the coronavirus are going to have a mild disease. Very few will actually need to be hospitalized.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- so for those people who are actually infected in this hot spot, on this cruise ship, are they be-- being released into the public?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, what we're-- what we're prioritizing when we look at the cruise ship situation is, number one, making sure people who are sick on the cruise ship get the medical care that they need, that they're appropriately evacuated. And we've sent CDC teams on to the ship. We've sent personal protective equipment on to the ship. We're making sure, number two, that we can get people off the ship as quickly and as safely as possible. But we're working with Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and the local authorities to make sure we have a safe place to take these people to because we--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So does--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: --don't want to endanger--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: --the local community.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --that people who are infected are going to go to military bases all around the country?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, the plans are still being developed. But I want people to know that we are not going to put infected people into communities. Infected people will be quarantined-- will be isolated appropriately so that we can make sure we're not putting communities at risk.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Because the governor of Georgia said thirty-four Georgians and additional Americans will be going to an airbase. You're saying none of those people will be infected?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, there's a difference between quarantine and isolation. Isolation is where you put people who actually have tested positive. Quarantine is where you put people who've been exposed. We may be quarantining people in different places across the country while we watch them for fourteen days to make sure they don't develop symptoms. But no one who's tested positive for a coronavirus or who has symptoms will be put in a position where they can expose other people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. We're going to take a break and talk more on the other side of it. So stay with us, Doctor.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us here on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot more FACE THE NATION coming your way. We will be right back with the Surgeon General Doctor Jerome Adams; plus, our political panel and the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to pick up where we left off with the Surgeon General Doctor Jerome Adams. And I just want to just button up where we left off--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --on the matter of the cruise ship. If someone is exposed and testing positive, will they be kept in the State of California?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Some of them-- well we're still working out where we can best put those folks. You have to understand, these are four--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But they dock tomorrow.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: These are four-- yes and that plan is being developed right now. There are four-- almost four thousand people on that cruise ship. We're working with the Department of Defense. The most important thing for American people to know is that folks who test positive will be kept isolated so that they cannot expose other people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: We don't want to put communities at risk.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But people who do test positive could be dispersed to military bases around the country?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, we're going to try to keep them as contained as possible, but we're going to make sure-- and as close as possible, but we're going to make sure they are in a place that we feel we can keep them from exposing the rest of the community.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we should expect a decision on that by the 4:00 PM meeting that you have at the White House every day?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, exactly. And again, I would refer you to Ambassador Birx for more information on that. We want to make sure the American people know that we're prioritizing the health of the people on that ship, getting them off the ship as quickly as possible, as safely as possible, not exposing the communities.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about-- I mean it seems that nursing homes in particular are very vulnerable.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Older people are being advised, as you heard from Doctor Fauci there, to reconsider putting themselves in certain circumstances. Would you tell someone over the age of what, fifty-five, sixty--I mean what's the age group that you're saying should not get on a plane or get on a cruise ship?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, great question. And we're-- we've gotten new data emerging. We know that the average age of people who are dying from coronavirus is eighty plus. We know that the average age of people who are needing medical care and advanced medical care is sixty plus. And so what we're telling folks is that if you're in an at-risk group, meaning you're elderly and or you have comorbidities: heart disease, lung disease, you're immunosuppressed for whatever reason, that you should be taking extra precautions not to put yourself in a situation where you may be exposed.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What if you're pregnant?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Again, if you're pregnant, I would advise taking extra precautions. But that said, no one under the age of thirty has died of the coronavirus in-- in South Korea. No one under the age of fifty has died of coronavirus in Japan. There's something about being younger that is protective. But if you are in one of those higher risk groups, we suggest you avoid crowded spaces. We suggest you avoid potentially going on a cruise or taking a long-haul flight because most people are going to be fine, but we want those folks who we know are at higher risk for complications to protect themselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But New York State declared an emergency and they have said you can't have visitors until further notice. I mean, should other states be doing this? Would you advise other states to do this?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, that's one of the reasons the vice president and I have been going around the country. We've spoken with three-- I have spoken with three governors in the past week saying you need to be having these conversations right now. And I would encourage folks to go to CDC.gov. There is specific guidance for audiences, businesses, schools. I met with the National Association of Evangelicals, faith leaders. We want them to be thinking now about what their triggers would be. But the risk is going to be different in different places. What you're going to do in Seattle is going to be different than what you're going to do in Jackson, Mississippi, for instance.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been a state health commissioner. In fact, you were one under then Governor Mike Pence out in the state of--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: We dealt with Ebola. We dealt with Zika. Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the largest HIV outbreak from intravenous drug use.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And some point to that fact, in fact, it was a criticism from Senator Murphy here, that this administration has been slow to respond to this virus. Given that Vice President Pence and you, same team, different situation, how do you respond to that? That there was a slow response then, there's a slow response now?\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, I'd rather talk about coronavirus, but it's important for folks to know that syringe service--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But the speed of the response, specifically, is what he was criticizing you were for-- for--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: And I--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --not having kits in place, for not laying the groundwork.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: I appreciate the question. Syringe service programs, which folks really are looking at as-- as stemming the tide of HIV transmission in Indiana were illegal when Governor Pence took office--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: He was talking about testing kits for coronavirus--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, okay. And-- and-- and--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --not being ordered.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: And I-- and I was referring to the HIV situation. Governor Pence showed leadership in that situation. Syringe service programs were illegal when he came in. They were legal when he left. He actually was one of the few governors from a red state that actually expanded access to care, which helped in that response. And so we have the right person in charge of this response right now and that's a recommendation of the-- a panel that-- that Susan Brooks led in Congress in 2015, that the vice president leads just such a response. Now as far as the coronavirus is concerned we've been leaning into containment initially which is trying to keep the virus from entering the country. We now are seeing community spread and we're trying to help people understand how to mitigate the impact of disease spread.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Containment didn't work. Now you're looking at mitigation.\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Well, containment worked to slow the introduction of the virus and gave people time to prepare, and now we know that communities need to look at how we deal with-- with community spread and things such as social distancing, not having large gatherings, pulling down events. Those are conversations that communities need to be having right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Doctor, for coming and telling us what you are--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Thank you. And stay safe by washing your hands, by covering your cough, by staying home if you're sick. Masks do not work for the general public and preventing them from getting coronavirus.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. And elbow bumps. Thank you very much--\u00a0JEROME ADAMS: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --Doctor.\u00a0We'll be right back with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Good to have you back on the program.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: Thanks a lot.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we just left off with the surgeon general who said right there at the end that they are switching strategies. They are no longer looking to contain the virus. They are looking to mitigate it. Does that mean-- does that mean they are acknowledging what they've been doing is not working?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we have an epidemic underway here in the United States. There's a very large outbreak in Seattle. That's the one we know about, probably one in Santa Clara or maybe other parts of the country, other cities. And so we're past the point of containment. We have to implement broad mitigation strategies. The next two weeks are really going to change the complexion in this country. We'll get through this, but it's going to be a hard period. We're looking at two months probably of difficulty. To give you a basis of comparison, two weeks ago, Italy had nine cases. Ninety-five percent of all their cases have been diagnosed in the last ten days. For South Korea, eighty-five percent of all their cases have been diagnosed in the last ten days. We're entering that period right now of rapid acceleration. And the sooner we can implement tough mitigation steps in places we have outbreaks like Seattle, the-- the lower the scope of the epidemic here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about mitigation because when I asked Governor Inslee what he is doing and I asked him a few ways if he'd consider doing what Italy just did--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --which is, essentially, trying to-- I mean, they're quarantining a quarter of their population in the most economically vital part of their country. This is a massive decision for them to have made. When I asked him about doing something like that in Washington State, he said, well, they are talking about more distancing and--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --more measures like that. Is it just that it-- governors like him don't want to say out loud that we may have to do something like what Italy did?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think no state and no city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy. But that's what's going to need to happen. States and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest right now to prevent a broader epidemic.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Shut down their economy? You mean--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Close businesses, close large gatherings, close theaters, cancel events. I think we need to think about, how do we provide assistance to the people of these cities who are going to be hit by hardship, as well as the localities themselves to try to give them an incentive to do this? Right now, if-- if there's no economic support to do this, you don't want to be the first to go. And I think you're seeing that. This exposes one of the challenges of our federal system that we leave a lot of authority to state and local officials. And there's a good-- there's good reasons why. But in a situation like this, we want them to act not just in their local interests, but the national interests, I think we need to think about both trying to coerce them. We can't force them but also try to provide some incentives in terms of support. And we're going to end up with a very big federal bailout package here for-- for stricken businesses, individuals, cities and states. We're better off doing it upfront and giving assistance to get them to do the right things than do it on the backend after we've had a very big epidemic.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you telling the White House to do these things? You used to work in the administration.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I'm still having discussions with people in the administration. I've been saying this publicly for, you know, weeks now. I think we should try to get ahead of this right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The President said this morning in a tweet, \"We have a \u2026perfectly coordinated and fine-tuned\u2026 plan at the White House for our attack on the coronavirus.\" And he said, \"The news media is doing everything possible to make us look bad.\" I'm asking you this not because I am a member of the media, but because we were trying to suss out what reality is, versus anxiety for the public. Is this a perfectly fine-tuned plan and is what people are hearing on the news, well as the President said, just to make him look bad?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: We have a narrow window of opportunity to implement tough measures to try to push down the scope of the epidemic. What you want to do is you want to put-- put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted. Because what happened in Wuhan, China, was the health care system got exhausted and fatalities rose quickly. What we need right now in terms of a good plan is a systematic approach to what you do in terms of mitigation steps and when cities should be implementing that. When--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see that happening yet?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There is no systematic plan for when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. We leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and then some support from the federal government for cities that make that step, make that leap, if you will.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- but just on the anxiety question here, the administration has compared this to the flu. Is that how people should be thinking about this?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: No, this is not the flu. China didn't shut down their economy because they had a bad flu season. The case fatality rate here is going to be higher all through the age ranges. This is a more severe disease. Now it's true that-- that you don't see the full spectrum of disease that you see with the flu where some people get a mild disease, some people get a moderate disease, some people get more severe disease. Here you're seeing a-- a more binary response. Some people get a mild-to-moderate disease and some people get very sick. But for the people who get very sick, this could be a very dangerous disease. The case fatality rate is probably going to be about one percent. And it's not just older Americans, as tragic as that is. And we shouldn't dismiss the burden that this is going to place on older Americans. If you look at forty-year-olds, the case fatality rate has been anywhere between point two and point four percent. So that means as many as one in two hundred and fifty-forty to fifty-year-olds who get this could die from it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And this data is based on what? On China? On South Korea?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: This data is based on reporting out of South Korea and China. Remember, when you look at the South Korea data, the case fatality rate in South Korea right now is point six. But the time to death is three to six weeks. And most of the cases were diagnosed in the last ten days. Time to hospitalization is nine to twelve days. So, most of these people in South Korea haven't worked through the severe stages of this-- of this disease. The case fatality rate will go up. And I'll-- one more point, you have to make a distinction between the case fatality rate and the infection fat-- fatality rate. We talk in medicine about the case fatality rate: how many people who get the disease will die? Some people are talking about the infection fatality rate. How many people who get the infection will die? That's not what we focus on in medicine because we know that some people will get the infection, but not be symptomatic. We typically don't count those. We count people who get the disease. And for that, the case fatality rate probably-- it might not reach one percent in our system, but it might get close to that. It's not point one. And that's the seasonal flu. And it's not .05 and that's a mild flu season.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And to get there, you need the adequate number of tests out there and testing to happen--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Which we're getting.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --which we're getting there.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --for your insight.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment with our political panel.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0PETE BUTTIGIEG: I will no longer seek to be the 2020 Democratic nominee for President.\u00a0SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I am ending my campaign.\u00a0SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden.\u00a0MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I entered the race for the President to defeat Donald Trump. And today, I am leaving the race for the same reason.\u00a0SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN: One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And a quote, \"former Vice President Biden,\" you heard him at the top of our broadcast, what a difference a week makes. This has been quite a turnaround for him and these campaigns. We've gathered some of the very best in the business for analysis today. Amy Walter is national editor at Cook Political Report and host of The Takeaway, Dan Balz is chief correspondent at The Washington Post, Joel Payne is the Democratic strategist and a CBS News contributor, and Leslie Sanchez is a CBS News political contributor, both are very familiar faces to our CBS and viewers. So it's great to have all of you here. Amy, a week ago--\u00a0AMY WALTER: I just-- it can't-- I can't believe it was just a week ago.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a week ago.\u00a0AMY WALTER: It feels like a-- a year and a half ago.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and we were talking about whether a single win in South Carolina could be--\u00a0AMY WALTER: Could be enough.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --enough to keep Joe Biden going in this race, then Tuesday happened. Now, we are calling it a two-man race.\u00a0AMY WALTER: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What drove this turnaround?\u00a0AMY WALTER: The most important person in the Democratic primary has always been Donald Trump. And being able to beat Donald Trump was the key issue, voters had been telling us for the last two years. They just couldn't quite figure out who the best candidate was to defeat him. I think after Nevada, there was this consensus, especially here in Washington, but even among regular voters that the candidate who was seen as the most, quote-- quote/unquote \"electable\" was not Bernie Sanders, but he was on the path to winning the nomination after Nevada. And you put that in combination with Joe Biden's big South Carolina win, thanks in large part to Congressman Jim Clyburn's endorsement and then to get all of those candidates who dropped out to endorse Joe Biden immediately is really phenomenal. I talked to one Republican who said, well, I guess Democrats are just-- they're just more disciplined than we are, we never could have done that in 2016. I said, they're not more disciplined than Republicans, it's that Donald Trumpers represents a much more existential threat, at least Democrats see it that way, that's what brought them to the table. I don't know if a president Marco Rubio or a president Jeb Bush would have gotten Democrats to do what they did with Joe Biden this week.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Dan, what I hear Amy saying is basically Democrats didn't fall in love in the week. They fell in line with the party.\u00a0DAN BALZ: Yeah. I--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And aligned themselves here.\u00a0DAN BALZ: I think they did. And I-- I totally agree with Amy that-- that-- that the issue was who-- who would they rally around eventually? Because we knew that Senator Sanders had a very loyal base of support but what we saw in both Iowa and New Hampshire and to some extent in Nevada, was that he wasn't the overwhelming choice. He was the choice of twenty-five to thirty-five percent of the popular-- of the Democrats. That meant there was a big group that was looking for somebody else. And they were looking for some kind of cue or clue as to what to do, and African-American voters in South Carolina gave them that cue in a very strong way, and that brought everybody together, you know, in a-- in a way that no one could have anticipated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Senator Sanders, though, Joel, had been campaigning and on programs just like this one would say time and again that he was unique in being able to bring in young voters, motivated voters to the Democratic Party, but then on Tuesday, he had this to say.\u00a0SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (Wednesday): Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? And the answer is no. We're making some progress, but, historically, everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: He says he didn't get the youth vote the way he expected, black voters didn't vote his way. Latino voters, though, in certain states did stick with Bernie Sanders.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: They-- they did. It's not the coalition that you have to build to win in the Democratic primary this time. It's funny, we were told to expect a revolution, you know, Bernie Sanders talks about a revolution except we thought it would be from the left of the party, not from the center left of the party, it was senior voters, it was working class, folks in the middle of the country, it was suburbanites, college-educated women and it was African-Americans. That's the revolution we saw. We saw surges in all of those numbers of voters. We've even seen a surge in turnout in some of these early states, in Nevada and New Hampshire and South Carolina. Big numbers that actually spell pretty well for Democrats this November. And I think the Biden campaign has been saying, as Amy said, the animating issue in this primary is a-- a desire to defeat Donald Trump. And I think that they feel like that is the biggest reason why the wind's at their back right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you think that there would be a time when you would say African-American voters have led the way for the establishment that everyone is following them?\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Totally.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On that nominee?\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: I-- I-- not to toot my own horn, but I actually wrote it about-- about four months ago. And I know there are a lot of folks not just African-American, the--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But beyond South Carolina.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Oh, totally.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Absolutely. Look, African-Americans are the core of the Democratic base, and particularly African-American women are the most reliable--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: --Democratic constituency over the past few elections.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Harris has reminded us of that time and again.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Absolutely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But she didn't get the support enough to stay in the race. This morning she's out there and he is endorsing Joe Biden. Should we expect to see more of her?\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Totally. And I, look, I think, obviously, she is-- she is a-- she is a clear candidate for the vice presidency--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: --that-- that folks would kind of make that-- that grouping, that Biden-Harris grouping. But you also have to think about if you're Joe Biden, how do you pull in those Sanders voters if-- if Bernie Sanders is not the nominee? How do you pull in those folks to make sure that they do not feel ostracized and alienated by the party? Does Kamala Harris do that? Is there another person of color, younger, woman candidate who can do that? Maybe there's something else out there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Leslie, I want to ask you, you know, Senator Warren, we played that clip of her talking about promising all those young girls and they're going to have to wait another four years. She also said something very specific to gender and how it factored in this race. Let's listen.\u00a0SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN (Thursday): Gender in this race, you know, that is the trap question for every woman. If you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says whiner. And if you say, no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, what planet do you live on?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you make of that? We didn't hear this from Senator Klobuchar when she dropped out.\u00a0LESLIE SANCHEZ: No. And I think that's an interesting distinction that you have there. Traditionally, on the road to the White House, there are these unique challenges. There are narrations that they have, kind of frameworks they have for-- for male candidates, their authoritative, the leadership style, it-- it bolsters kind of their sense of commander-in-chief. For women, in contrary with the similar traits, there's-- or more feminine traits, it's viewed through a different lens. In many ways sometimes women are categorized as the-- as ditzy, as a witch, or as somebody who's a media darling, we can never really look at them in a whole in terms of what they represent.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you agree with her?\u00a0LESLIE SANCHEZ: I think there's some legitimacy to that. But look at the-- let's look at the distinction she raised over a hundred million dollars. She's coming off the back of a Congress, a Democratic Congress where more women were elected than they had, historically, and the eighteen million cracks of Hillary Clinton who was at the top of the ticket in 2016. So there has been momentum for female candidates. It-- it's hard for candidates, male or female, to face that their policies did not connect with the vast sum of voters who are looking for a nominee and in this case to take on Donald Trump.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree?\u00a0AMY WALTER: Yeah. Well, and every campaign has to meet the moment, right, and this moment for-- I-- I like Joel's about the-- the revolution of the center, which was this was not a time when voters were willing to take a risk, take a risk on a thirty-eight-year-old candidate who's openly gay, not willing to take a risk with a candidate and Elizabeth Warren who also was seen as-- as too far to the left might not be able to beat Donald Trump. And if you talk to strategists, I'm-- I'm sure that Dan has heard the same thing, Democratic strategists will tell you we sat in focus groups whereas many women said I'm worried that a woman can't beat Donald Trump as did men.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Dan, you had an extraordinary week for President Trump, not just because of the coronavirus that we have been talking about, it was not a good week for him in the financial markets. You had the airline industry getting hit hard. Southwest CEO says it has a 9/11-like feel these days, the Federal Reserve stepped in and took extraordinary measures, cutting rates. Is the President losing his best pitch for reelection?\u00a0DAN BALZ: Well, we don't know how long this is going to last. Right now we're in a terrible moment, and-- and sort of the economic carnage that we're beginning to see is going to continue to ripple, I mean, in listening to the experts who were on here earlier today. We're at the front end of some of this and it's going to get worse. So, in that sense, the biggest issue that has-- he's had going for him is a strong economy and he now faces a period in which that's not going to be the case. I think the issue is going to be how long does it go on? And what do people think about what was the reason for it and the degree to which he gets the blame as opposed to somebody else. But we're going to go through a bad period and if you are the President of the United States, that's never good politically for you.\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Margaret, I think the worst thing that happened for the President was his comment to that town hall about Social Security and Medicare. I can tell you, as someone who's spoken to a folk-- few folks near the Biden campaign, they saw that as a fastball right down the middle for Joe Biden to start to make his general election case against Donald Trump. It's not the first time he said it but the fact that he would say that to combine with all the other things that are happening, that's very ominous politically for the President to be talking that openly about that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Indicating potential cuts?\u00a0JOEL PAYNE: Yes.\u00a0LESLIE SANCHEZ: No, I was going to say, I think the-- the President is trying to influence the nation to keep that stiff upper lip, right, to stay informed but not to buy into hysteria as the public sentiment tries to go up. And the reason it's becoming so politicized, which is the unfortunate part, and it's hard I think, Margaret, what you're trying to do is cipher fact from fiction here, is because there is this lane across the Democratic kind of thinking and what they're saying and their messaging, is this a failure of the presidential management style, just similar to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina? Are we falling in that line?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0LESLIE SANCHEZ: And the President's going to push back and say I have the task force. We are, you know, aligned, working private industry and the federal government, 8.3 billion dollars, that was a joint--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0LESLIE SANCHEZ: --Republican-Democrat initiative. That-- that's where this gets political.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And it will be interesting to see what the new chief of staff at the White House will do. And what impact he will have.\u00a0We will be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

            "article_content": "A week after\u00a0Super Tuesday, the Democratic field has winnowed to two main candidates,\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Joe Biden, who will be fighting for delegates in six states on\u00a0Tuesday. The most closely-watched of these upcoming six states is Michigan. With 125 delegates, it offers the biggest prize of the night. In 2016, Sanders scored a major surprise upset against Hillary Clinton, by winning the majority of white voters, though Clinton won handily among black voters and women. It is unclear whether Sanders can replicate that victory this time around against Biden. Like Clinton, Biden has so far proven he has significant support among African Americans, and he is also more popular among working-class white voters than Clinton was.\u00a0 A new poll from\u00a0Monmouth University\u00a0released on Monday showed Biden with a commanding lead over Sanders. Fifty-one percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they planned to support Biden compared to 36% for Sanders. Biden led Sanders among white voters (50% to 36%), voters of other races, (53% to 36%), voters age 50 and over (62% to 24%) and women (53% to 33%). Sanders led Biden among voters under 50 years old (49% to 38%) and men (49% to 39%). As of last week, according to a\u00a0Detroit News/WDIV\u00a0poll, absentee voters who had cast their votes also heavily favored Biden over Sanders.\u00a0Pollster Richard Czuba\u00a0estimated that \"Biden can bank an almost 150,000-vote lead on Sanders just through absentees.\" Michigan voters care most about beating President Trump (39.3%). Health care was a distant second (18.5%), the survey found.\u00a0 Sanders is making a big push in Michigan, having appeared at events in five different cities during the final weekend before Tuesday's primary. He went to the county where he suffered his biggest defeat in 2016 by vote total, Wayne County, home of Detroit, and the county where he had his biggest win by vote total, Kent County, where Grand Rapids is located. He also stopped by the liberal haven of Ann Arbor to try to boost support from University of Michigan students at a rally with one of highest-profile supporters, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Young voters were critical to his success in 2016 in Michigan, and they're supporting him in large numbers so far in 2020. On the trail in Michigan, he has been vocal about trade, continuing to hammer home the theme that Biden has championed trade deals like NAFTA that many union voters view with suspicion. Turnout among African American voters will be closely watched. Though Biden's ties to black voters have been proven in the contests so far, turnout in Michigan, particularly in Wayne County, and the level of enthusiasm for him could be a key factor on Tuesday. Suburban women are another key constituency for Biden. Sanders has promised to expand the electorate with new voters, but after a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday, he has admitted some disappointment that the level of turnout is not what he had hoped for or anticipated. Michigan holds what's known as an open closed primary \u2014 there is no party registration requirement in the state. Any person can vote in either party's primary, but voters must ask for one party's ballot when they show up at the polls and identify in writing which political party they wish to vote with in the primary.\u00a0\u00a0Due to a 2018 ballot measure, voters can vote absentee without providing a reason. If a person voted absentee for a candidate who has since suspended his or her campaign, that voter can change their vote if they submitted requests in writing by March 7 or appear in person by Monday, March 9. As of March 6, 24,109 people had done this, according to the Michigan Secretary of State's office. Michigan's results could take some time to tabulate. As of March 5, about 90% more absentee ballots were sent compared to five days before the primary in 2016. Nearly 600,000 absentee ballots had been cast as of that day. The secretary of state has pushed Michigan's Legislature to change state law to allow clerks to process or count absentee ballots before Election Day.\u00a0 Sanders is expected to do well in Idaho and North Dakota, both states with largely white and rural populations, and both states he won in 2016 against Clinton. He is also polling high in Washington state, the last primary to close on Tuesday. But like California, most of Washington votes by mail, so the results may not be known for some time. \u00a0 MISSISSIPPI Mississippi also votes on Tuesday. It's a state that's expected to go big for Biden, given that it has an even larger African American Democratic electorate than South Carolina. In 2016, 71% of the Democratic primary voters in the state were African American. Polls will be open between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. ET. There is no early voting in the state. Absentee ballots had to be received by March 9 to be counted.\u00a0 As of March 5, more than 15,000 voters had requested an absentee ballot for the March 10 election, according to the secretary of state's office. As of March 3, only 10,503 ballots have been received by the circuit clerks offices. MISSOURI In 2016, Clinton had the support from key political figures and labor unions in the state, but won the state by less than 1,500 votes. Exit polling said Clinton won women with 54% but Sanders won men with 56%. Sanders also won over voters under 44, while Clinton had the backing of voters in the state 45 years old and up. Clinton also won 67% of black voters, compared to Sanders 32%, but Sanders won white voters 54% to 45%.\u00a0 Missouri is an open primary, so voters can ask for any party's ballot on Election Day. Delegates will be allocated proportionally to the vote, and the threshold for delegates is 15%. Missouri does not have early voting but allows absentee voting. The period to request ballots ended last week, and those ballots must either be received by the time polls close Tuesday or submitted in person by Monday. According to the office of the Missouri secretary of state, 66,374 people had requested absentee ballots as of March 6, but a spokesperson for the office said it would not have a clear sense of how many had been returned until after the election. IDAHO In the Idaho primary, candidates need to meet at 15% threshold at the congressional district level or statewide to be considered viable. Independent and unaffiliated voters are allowed to participate in the Democratic primary but cannot participate in the Republican primary. In-person early voting in Idaho ran from February 24 through March 6.\u00a0 In 2018, Idaho changed from a party-run caucus to a state-run primary. Idaho allows same-day registration for voters at polling locations. Sanders prevailed against Clinton in the state in 2016. NORTH DAKOTA North Dakota holds a firehouse caucus, which is essentially a party-run primary. The caucuses are open and anyone can participate. Voting by mail took place January 20 through March 5. In the open caucuses, candidates must meet a threshold of 15% statewide to be considered viable. In 2016, Sanders beat Clinton in the state, winning the state's 18 delegates. Its voters are also largely white and rural. ***Musadiq Bidar, Adam Brewster, Sarah Ewall-Wice & Alex Tin contributed to this report \u00a0 JOE BIDEN By the end of Monday night, Biden in Michigan will have appeared with his trio of recent, high-profile endorsers: Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer,\u00a0Senator Cory Booker\u00a0of New Jersey and\u00a0Senator Kamala Harris\u00a0of California. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson says that with the latest endorsement, Booker's backing on Monday morning, a total of 10 former Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed Biden. Sanders currently has two from former 2020 rivals: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Marianne Williamson. \u00a0While Biden hopes to focus in the Rust Belt on his health care policy differences with Sanders, coronavirus has placed both the president and the Democratic candidates under the spotlight. \"I think there's no confidence in the president, in anything he says or does,\" Biden told MSNBC on Monday. \"I wish he'd be quiet, just let the experts speak and acknowledge whatever they suggest to him is what we should be doing.\" BERNIE SANDERS Sanders dodged a question today about taking personal precautions for his own health in the wake of coronavirus, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. \"Well, I'm surrounded by medical personnel,\" Sanders said referring to a panel of health care professional around him, assembled for a campaign event on coronavirus. \"Thank you for asking. I am running for President of the United States and that requires a whole lot of work,\" he said. Sanders' message on coronavirus is twofold: First, he said the Trump administration's failure to embrace \"science\" is making the situation worse, including the appointment of Vice President Mike Pence as coronavirus czar. During the panel discussion, Sanders read a quote from the president that suggested people should work through symptoms. \"That might be the stupidest advice ever made by a president of the United States,\" said Sanders. Secondly, folding in Medicare for All, Sanders said a vaccine should be made free for everyone. He also said a single-payer system would lower the risks on contamination as people could to the doctor without fear of not affording care. Earlier Monday, at a rally in St. Louis, Sanders spoke the virus at length. \"And just look at the insanity dealing with this coronavirus, this very serious problem that we're dealing with in America, dealing with all over the world. Think about the insanity of a system where today, somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus. Yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor. What does that mean? So they're gonna go to work, and make a serious epidemic even worse,\" he said.\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Less than a week after suspending his presidential campaign, billionaire and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg is spending his own money to combat voter suppression.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0confirms Bloomberg gave $2 million to Collective Future for African American voter registration. This is not the first time Bloomberg has spent his own wealth for this particular issue. In December 2019, Bloomberg announced a $5 million donation to Stacey Abrams' new voter protective initiative. This donation expands on Bloomberg's commitment to register 500,000 voters from under-represented groups in key swing states heading into November's general election. \"Voter suppression efforts across the country have been a barely disguised effort to keep Black Americans and other Democratic-leaning voters from the polls. I've always believed we need to make it easier for all citizens to register and vote, not harder.\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \"That's why I strongly support Collective Future in their effort to register 500,000 Black Americans. These new voters could determine the November election - and the future of the country. The stakes couldn't be higher. So while our campaign for the presidency is over, our work to get America back on track is still growing.\" A spokesperson for Bloomberg told CBS News the money was transferred last week, but the proposal had been in the works before Bloomberg exited the race after a poor Super Tuesday showing. CORY BOOKER Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced on Monday he is endorsing Biden for president says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In an email to supporters, Booker explained his decision to endorse Biden. \"Joe is building the kind of campaign that will do more than remove one guy from one office,\" the email reads. \"He will lead the Democratic Party to victory in races up and down the ballot across the country this November.\" In an interview with \"CBS This Morning, Booker talked about the importance of unifying the Democratic Party ahead of Tuesday's primary contests. \"It is about time we start unifying as a party and begin the work to beat Donald Trump and frankly, save our nation, humanity, address our common cause and our common challenges,\" Booker said. PETE BUTTIGIEG In his first television interview since suspending his presidential campaign, Pete Buttigieg told NBC News the decision to drop out of the race was his own after being asked if the \"establishment\" pressured him to end his presidential bid. \"Look the kind of people who run for President of the United States are the kind of people who make their own decisions,\" Buttigieg said. \"It was my decision.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Buttigieg also announced that he will be guest hosting \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" on Thursday. He said that one of the guests on Thursday is actor Sir Patrick Stewart.\u00a0 ISSUES THAT MATTER TRADE There's a\u00a0trade war\u00a0raging between the top two Democratic presidential contenders, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0Cara Korte. Since Super Tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, Sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and Biden disagree. Trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men\u00a0fight for delegates\u00a0in the industrial Midwest. Though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in Michigan on Tuesday or next week in Ohio could signal how the Democratic Party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda. Across one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, Sanders has been taking swipes at Biden's positions on trade. He slammed then-Senator Biden's support of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated most tariffs between the U.S., Mexico and Canada and the 2000 China Trade Bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (PNTR) with China. Sanders voted against both measures as a House member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a Sanders\u00a0ad\u00a0called \"Decimated\" that's up in every March 10 and March 17 primary state. \"If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements,\" Sanders told a Detroit crowd on Friday. This playbook may seem familiar to Democrats, since Sanders waged a similar campaign against Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries in Michigan. He skewered her at a Democratic debate held in Flint, Michigan, two days before the primary. \"Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. NAFTA, supported by the Secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs,\" he said at the time. The argument helped Sanders eke out a win over Clinton in the Great Lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. Later, Mr. Trump, too, consistently criticized Clinton over NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character. \"I worked with the unions as a member of the House of Representative to defeat NAFTA and to defeat PNTR with China. I can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in Montpellier, Vermont in opposition to NAFTA. I knew what it was gonna do. I knew that you cannot ask American workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in Mexico,\" Sanders said Friday in Detroit. The senator hit the same note during campaign stops in Michigan over weekend. He said in Flint on Saturday that \"I heard, during that period in the '90s, I heard all of corporate America say, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' And all of the media said, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' I stood with the unions, the working families of this country; I voted against those agreements! Joe Biden voted for those agreements.\" The reviews of NAFTA are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after Canada ratifies it. In 2013, the liberal think tank\u00a0Economic Policy Institute\u00a0projected that NAFTA caused, \"20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power.\" At the same time,\u00a0Foreign Affairs\u00a0estimates that 14 million American jobs still depend on NAFTA. And a 2016 report from the\u00a0U.S. International Trade Commission\u00a0concluded the policy, \"had essentially no effect on real wages in the United States of either skilled or unskilled workers.\" Biden has rarely brought up North American trade policy on the stump since the Iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with China. Instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of U.S. production to cheaper alternatives in Mexico, as\u00a0General Motors\u00a0did in March 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in Ohio alone. He stands by his NAFTA vote, arguing that \"no, it wasn't\" a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last May in Iowa. He has labeled himself a \"fair trader,\" rather than a \"free trader.\"\u00a0 He added, \"We should treat other countries in a way they treat us\u2026Just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more.\" The most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the USMCA agreement, an idea then-candidate Barack Obama pitched\u00a0in the 2008\u00a0primary. Biden has said that in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told CBS News in summer 2019 that he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed \"from the beginning\" of the NAFTA negotiation in the 1990s. Sanders\u00a0unapologetically\u00a0voted against USMCA, stating that protections did not go far enough. On this matter Sanders stood alone. His one-time Democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. Elizabeth Warren, once Sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the USMCA and bargain for a better deal if elected. \u00a0The distinction was noted by some in the Rust Belt. Frank Hammer, a retired 32-year General Motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with Sanders Friday in Detroit. \"You were the singular, sole [candidate] that said \u2014 consistent with your past positions \u2014 that you were opposed to [USMCA] and I think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers,\" Hammer said. \"And I'm so grateful. Thank you.\"\u00a0 On the trail Biden has dismissed China's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges Chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the U.S. dominance in the future. \"The idea that China is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre,\" he said in Iowa in late January, suggesting that rather than viewing China as an existential threat, the U.S. could help China with some of its problems. The U.S. \"can compete with China and insist that they follow the rules,\" he proposed. Unlike the\u00a0Social Security ads\u00a0the Biden campaign is running in Michigan, two Biden advisers tell CBS News after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage Sanders on the intra-party trade war.\u00a0 \"At this point I'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis,\" one Biden adviser told CBS News, \"They're looking for a nominee.\" Others agree that focusing on trade \u2014 even in Michigan \u2014 may not be as beneficial as Sanders hopes. \"I think it's a miscalculation from Sanders,\" Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. Wolfers cited a\u00a0Gallup\u00a0poll that shows 67% of self-described Democrats say that NAFTA has been beneficial for the United States. Wolfers said that with the Mr. Trump's election \"everything is a little upside down\" in terms of trade politics because the GOP incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any Democratic nominee is likely to make. \"Relatively speaking, Democrats are now the pro-trade party,\" Wolfers added. Biden has a strong argument to make in Michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the Obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big U.S. automakers, General Motors and Chrysler. \"Just like the automobile industry came back, Detroit is going to come back,\" Biden said\u00a0in 2014. \"It's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. It symbolizes the manufacturing might of the United States of America.\" According to an invitation\u00a0obtained\u00a0by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, Biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in Michigan this week, co-hosted by Cynthia and Edsel Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford. CALIFORNIA The California primary is far from over with more than 3 million ballots still left to count, according to estimates published by the California Secretary of State. As of Monday afternoon, CBS News estimates Sanders leads with 33.9%, followed by Biden at 26.6%. Sanders so far is estimated to win 185 delegates while Biden is at 143.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says the millions of ballots that remain unprocessed are because of last minute voters \u2013 those who either put their ballots in the mail on Election Day, or who voted in person but decided to change their party registration on the spot. This also includes ballots that were damaged, had typos, or required careful examination from a human election worker. In California, it typically takes counties weeks to process and count all of the ballots. According to the Secretary of State's office, Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the state, has more than 800,000 ballots that still need to be counted. San Diego County has about 350,000 remaining ballots, roughly 200,000 remain unaccounted in Sacramento County while more than 100,000 need to be counted in San Francisco County. State law requires county elections officials to report the final results to the Secretary of State by April 3, 2020. The Secretary of State has until April 10, 2020, to certify the results of the election. IN THE SENATE Governor Steve Bullock\u00a0announced Monday morning\u00a0he will be running for the U.S. Senate, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Democrats have had their eyes on Bullock as a potential candidate to take on Republican incumbent Steve Daines in November. Bullock has won statewide three times and won his second term as governor of Montana in 2016, the same year Donald Trump carried the state by about 20 points. A popular Democrat in a red state would give Democrats a chance at expanding the map for Senate battlegrounds in 2020. Bullock was reluctant to run for Senate at first because he wanted a more executive role, so he launched a presidential bid in May. He told\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0around the time of his announcement that his experience \"has always been executive, and I think that's where I could best apply my talents, and that's what I'm looking forward to.\"\u00a0 Bullock suspended his presidential campaign after seven months without gaining traction in the polls. In the interview in May, Bullock also told O'Keefe, \"I know that we're going to have good candidates in Montana to take on Senator Daines.\" However, no strong candidate emerged in the months leading up to Monday's filing deadline. The deadline to submit candidacies to the Secretary of State's office is Monday evening. Bullock plans to file with his wife and children by his side at the secretary's office in Helena.",

            "article_content": "A frantic effort is underway to recruit a new generation of poll workers as older workers are stepping back due to\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0concerns. Experts tell CBS News that likely 250,000 to 300,000 new poll workers are needed nationwide, assuming 40% of previous poll workers\u00a0will not be there. \"I've shed many a tear\u2026 it's the people, I miss the people,\" poll worker Bea Sherrill, who will sit out working the 2020 election, told CBS News' Major Garrett. Sherrill spent more than a decade working elections in Newton, North Carolina. She said she spoke consulted her doctor amid concerns over her age and underlying health conditions making her vulnerable to the coronavirus this cycle.\u00a0 \"When I raised the question with him, his face immediately said no,\" she said. Her story is occurring to Americans across the country. According to a 2018 study, 58% of poll workers are 61 or older, putting many in an age group susceptible to the virus.\u00a0 Election officials across the country, like Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, are racing to recruit enough people to staff voting precincts amid the pandemic.\u00a0 \"The bare minimum that we need is 37,000, just to\u00a0open the polls\u00a0on Election Day,\" LaRose said. \"We wanted to have that 50% extra as a reserve force in case there's a resurgence in the virus, or folks choose not to show up on November 3, so really what our target is 55,000.\" The shortage has forced them to take on creative recruiting tactics \u2014 like allowing 17-year-old high school seniors to serve as poll workers, encouraging businesses to give employees the day off and incentivizing charitable organizations to pitch in.\u00a0 \"One of the silver linings to this whole pandemic experience, as it relates to election administration, is this will be the year that we recruited that whole new generation of poll workers,\" LaRose said. Even former President Barack Obama made a national appeal to Americans this week, partnering with\u00a0NBA superstars\u00a0and warning that \"democracy doesn't work if just a few people do it.\" Among those who heard the call is Abby Lublin, a first time poll worker in Durham, North Carolina.\u00a0 \"If we can't staff the polls, it's too easy of an excuse to close them,\" she said. \"So I don't want to give any excuse for voter suppression.\" Lublin has been taking training classes online in preparation for working at her Election Day site at a local elementary school. In most places, poll workers must work in the same county they live in, adding population distribution issues to the task of recruitment.\u00a0 \"It's invisible work,\" Lublin said. \"And I'm doing it because I can. I am incredibly lucky, incredibly privileged that I can do this and I think it's a time where we figure out what our capacity is and do whatever we can.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump's campaign will seek a recount in two Wisconsin counties, it said Wednesday, alleging without presenting evidence that absentee ballots were illegally issued and altered, and county clerks advised voters on how to skirt the state's voter ID laws, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Nicole Sganga,\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn. The campaign said it is filing a\u00a0petition\u00a0with the Wisconsin\u00a0Elections\u00a0Commission for recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties, due to the purported irregularities and has transferred $3 million to the state to cover the cost of the recounts. \"The people of Wisconsin deserve to know whether their election processes worked in a legal and transparent way,\" Jim Troupis, counsel to the campaign, said in a statement. \"Regrettably, the integrity of the election results cannot be trusted without a recount in these two counties and uniform enforcement of Wisconsin absentee ballot requirements. We will not know the true results of the election until only the legal ballots cast are counted.\" Late Wednesday night, the Wisconsin commission agreed to issue an order to recount the ballots cast in the two counties. The vote was unanimous and came near the end of a six hours-plus meeting, Brewster reports. The session was filled with intense partisan bickering and several 3-3 deadlocked decisions along party lines. CBS News\u00a0projected\u00a0President-elect Joe Biden won the state of Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes by more than 20,500 votes. In Dane County, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by more than 181,000 votes, and in Milwaukee County, the president-elect is ahead by more than 182,000 votes. Reversing that lead would be nearly impossible, as even statewide recounts typically change\u00a0voting\u00a0totals by just hundreds of votes. \"They've actually limited their ability to potentially overcome the relatively large 20,000-vote margin, by looking at only a small portion of Wisconsin overall,\"\u00a0CBS News election law expert David Becker\u00a0said. \"So it's almost impossible -- even with a statewide recount -- that they would be able to net even a tiny fraction of the 20,000-vote margin. And they're only looking at a small portion of Wisconsin, so the likelihood is even less. Their chances are about as close to zero as you can get.\" President-elect Joe Biden today held a virtual round table with frontline workers. During the discussion, he warned the lack of information-sharing by the Trump administration with Mr. Biden's transition team could leave the next administration \"behind weeks or months\" to implement its COVID response plans. \"I am optimistic but we should be further along\" in the transition process, Biden said. \"We've been unable to get access to kinds of things we need to know about the depth of stockpiles -- we know there is not much at all.\" The president-elect spoke with a firefighter, a school nurse, a home care worker, and a nurse, who explained she has not yet been given a COVID test. \"You're kidding me!\" Mr. Biden responded and promised his team would be rolling out \"quick-turn around testing\" for the country. He also called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Wednesday \"to congratulate her on her election as Democratic nominee for speaker of the House and express that he looks forward to working with her...on a shared agenda to get COVID-19 under control and build our economy back better,\" according to a statement released by his transition team. As Mr. Biden left the virtual roundtable taped in downtown Wilmington,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0asked\u00a0Biden why he hasn't yet called Senate Leader Mitch McConnell to discuss COVID-relief legislation with him directly. After a back-and-forth, Biden said it's \"because there's a lot going on\" but promised he would \"have more to say when it's all settled.\" CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that in a press conference Wednesday morning, Georgia voting systems implementation manager Gabriel Sterling said the margin in the presidential race is currently 12,781 votes in favor of President-elect Biden, after another county found that it had more ballots on hand than were reported on election night. A similar situation occurred in another Georgia county earlier this week, when 2,700 or so ballots were found that weren't initially reported on election night. Ahead of the midnight deadline for counties to complete their hand audits, Sterling said approximately 4.97 million ballots cast in state for the presidential election have been audited. In a\u00a0stunning reversal on Tuesday night, the Wayne County, Michigan, Board of Canvassers unanimously voted to certify the election results hours after the board deadlocked 2-2 over the issue, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Wayne County is Michigan's most populous county and home to Detroit, which is\u00a0about 80% Black. In addition to certifying the\u00a0election\u00a0results, the canvassing board also \"demands\" that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson conduct a \"comprehensive audit\" of all of the \"unexplained precincts\" around the county. The vote came after nearly three hours of public comment from Detroiters, residents from other Wayne County communities, Democrats and non-partisan poll observers who harshly criticized the county board's Republican members for not initially certifying the results. Many of the commenters accused them of trying to disenfranchise Black voters in Detroit. GEORGIA Democratic Senate candidate Reverend Raphael Warnock, who is challenging Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler in the January Georgia Senate runoff, held a virtual press conference today calling on Loeffler to speak out against attacks on Georgia's electoral process, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Reporters asked Warnock for his response to recent GOP attacks against him, one of which targets a sermon Warnock delivered in which he says, \"You cannot serve God and the military.\" Warnock replied, \"The gospel lesson says that you cannot serve God and Mammon, that a person cannot have two masters. It is a spiritual lesson that is basic and foundational for people of faith.\" He added, \"What I was expressing was the fact that as a person of faith, my ultimate allegiance is to God and therefore, whatever else that I may commit myself to, it has to be built on a spiritual foundation.\" CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0asked Warnock how his team is mobilizing voters, since turnout may be lower in a runoff than on Election Day. He said his team is deployed around the state, and he predicted there would be record turnout on the Democratic side. LEADERSHIP During a virtual vote among House Democrats, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leadership sailed through the nomination process Wednesday to be re-elected. Virtually all leadership positions ran unopposed, except for the open assistant speaker slot which was filled by Massachusetts Congresswoman Katherine Clark. House Republicans tied vulnerable members to Speaker Pelosi throughout the 2020 campaign and sent press releases on Thursday to districts of the members that won re-election, centered around whether the speaker would have enough final confirmation votes, noting the 15 votes against her in the 116th Congress. Pelosi will need to hold onto 218 votes during the formal vote on January 3, 2021 to be officially elected as speaker, and Democrats are working with a much smaller majority than the 233 seats they had after 2018. Republicans were able to unseat at least 11 incumbent Democrats this cycle and\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says at least seven uncalled House races remain, with four of them being held by incumbent Democrats. Meanwhile, Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer is keeping his spot as chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee after a\u00a0successful down-ballot performance on election day. \"I think he's probably out recruiting right now for the 2022 class that's going to get us back in the majority,\" GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said during a presser after the nomination vote Tuesday. Democrat Congressmen Tony Cardenas of California and Sean Patrick Maloney of New York are running to be the next DCCC Chair, and that election will take place the week of November 30. GOP WOMEN At least 27 Republican women will be headed to the House next year, breaking\u00a0records set in 2006, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. During a post-election press briefing Wednesday,Winning for Women Action Fund Director Micah Yousefi said the success this cycle has given them a \"model\" for adding to the GOP's ranks, and shrinking the number gap between them and Democratic Congresswomen. \"This was the first time we saw this kind of support from leadership to the House party committee...it clearly worked, there's no reason not to duplicate that bigger and better in future cycles,\" she said, adding that women could be inspired to run after seeing women win this cycle. NRCC Executive Director Parker Poling said every single flipped seat for Republicans was carried out by a woman, minority or veteran candidate. \"Peter Meijer is our token white male,\" she joked, referencing the flipped seat in Michigan's 3rd. \"Some of our best fundraisers in the entire country were women...I mean Nancy Mace raised $2.5 million in the final quarter. We didn't just have female candidates, we had extraordinary female candidates.\" Poling noted there were districts where their candidate had to outperform the president, such as in Texas' 24th, Indiana's 5th, and California's 39th and 48th Districts. \"I do think that just looking and sounding a little bit different, does help give you that little push in those really tough swing districts,\" she said. President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are scheduled to have a call Thursday with the governors about the pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. A National Governors Association official says the call's goal is \"to open the dialogue on COVID-19 mitigation strategies including the distribution of a vaccine.\" NGA Chair and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo first announced the call on MSNBC on Monday, criticizing Trump's handling of the crisis. \"They didn't handle the COVID testing operation, the PPE operation, the Defense Production Act - this federal administration failed at every turn. In some ways I say let's just move on. Let Joe Biden take the reins, let him start working with the governors and let's get it done because I don't believe Trump has the capacity to do it anyway,\" he said. CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports that members of the bipartisan NGA Leadership Committee will be on the call. This includes: NGA Chair Governor Cuomo of New York, Vice Chair Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Republican Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama, Democrat Governor Jared Polis of Colorado, Republican Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, Republican Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Democrat Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and Republican Governor Gary Herbert of Utah.",

            "article_content": "As the nation celebrates 100 years of women voting in the U.S., Americans are sending more women than ever to represent them in Washington \u2014 135. Among them are a record number of Republican women, after the party faced devastating setbacks in 2018. According to the Center for American Women and Politics, 32 GOP women will join the next Congress, surpassing the record of 30 Republican women sent in 2006. At least 24 Republican women so far will be headed to the House \u2014 including at least 13 new members \u2014 closing in on the party's 2006 House record of 25 women. \u00a0 Republican Beth Van Duyne in Texas' 24th District declared victory after Democrat Candace Valenzuela conceded on Tuesday. In California's 48th, incumbent  Democrat Harley Rouda has conceded to Republican Michelle Steel. Their wins would surpass the record of 25 Republican women elected to the House. CBS News has not yet called these races. \"The 2018 cycle was a story of Democratic success; this year we are seeing significant gains on the Republican side,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, in a statement. \"Advances for women must come from both sides of the aisle if women are to achieve equal representation in Congress.\" House Republicans exceeded expectations Tuesday night, unseating at least seven incumbent Democrats in competitive races, and women Republican candidates were the ones who flipped the seats in all but one contest. The winning candidates were Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, New Mexico's Yvette Herrell, Michelle Fischbash in Minnesota, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, Ashley Hinson in Iowa, and in South Carolina, Nancy Mace. \"It's a hundred years since women's suffrage. And if women want to be in office, we want to see more women in office, women need to run,\" said Mace, who will be the first woman to represent the Palmetto State in Congress. Mace said she thinks a lot of GOP women were inspired by what happened on the opposite side of the aisle two years ago. The surge in Republican women comes after the 2018 midterms ushered in a record number of women overall \u2014 but only a few were Republicans, raising red flags about representation in the party. Only 13 GOP women won seats in the House in 2018, and only 11 ran for re-election in 2020. \"The statistic that pops out in my mind is that there were more men named 'Jim' in the Republican caucus than there were Republican women,\" said Hinson, who won a tight race in Northeastern Iowa against a Democratic incumbent. \"I think [the number of women representatives] changes the dynamic of the dialogue across the country about what the party looks like.\" But the rise in the number of Republican women descending on Washington did not come without a concerted effort.\u00a0 \"Two years ago after the 2018 midterms, it was clear that the Republicans were facing a crisis level of Republican women in Congress,\" Elise Stefanik told CBS News. After that election, she launched Elevate PAC to identify and recruit women before the next primary season. At least thirteen of E-PAC's candidates have won their general election races and another six are leading in races that have not been decided. \u00a0 \"Republicans, we really shy away from the traditional identity politics. I'm a big believer that this is not identity politics, this is just focusing on finding the best candidates, the strongest candidates, who are also Republican women and making those investments early,\" Stefanik said. Republican Leadership including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Congressman Tom Emmer, chair of the National Republican Campaign Committee, made recruiting a more diverse 2020 class a top priority, too. In total, 227 Republican women filed to run, and 94 made it to the general election ballot \u2014 both records for the party.\u00a0 Former New Hampshire Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte is working with the Winning for Women super PAC, which was started after the 2018 elections and is dedicated to electing more Republican women. \"We support candidates throughout the entire process \u2014 from the primary process through a general election process, which having run for office myself and I think is really important,\" she said. \"Our efforts are really focused on, number one, helping qualified women to run, make sure that they know that they're going to have the support and resources because you can't win elections without resources.\" The House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund stepped in to help fuel campaigns running low on cash, such as Bice's in Oklahoma's 5th District and Nicole Malliotakis' in New York's 11th. Compared to well-established groups like Emily's List, WFW had a much tighter spending budget. Ayotte said the group\u00a0 had to focus on \"buttressing those races that just needed a little bit more to win.\" One example is in Iowa's 1st District, where the Women for Women Action Fund aired attack ads to support Hinson in a tight race against a Democrat incumbent. Hinson won by just under three points.\u00a0 \"This is a party that's seen an expanded tent under the Trump administration. We've seen more people come to the Republican Party. And I think that women are an important part of that expansion,\" said Hinson. Herrell, who also beat an incumbent freshman Democrat, will be the first Republican Native American woman to represent New Mexico. Salazar, who unseated Democrat Donna Shalala in Florida's 27th District, will be the second Cuban-American woman elected to Congress. And Cynthia Lummis will become the first female senator to represent the state of Wyoming. Hinson says that it's the relatable background behind every woman candidate that is \"what's really remarkable about this class.\"\u00a0 \"A lot of my campaign was, 'Guess what? I have a family, too.' I'm a woman who's multitasking, being a working mother, my husband owns a small business, so we are feeling the same struggles and challenges that many other families are facing,\" she said. \"So I think what it came down to is people want someone in Congress just like them. And that's exactly what this field of candidates did this cycle.\" CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "On a typical fall Saturday with college football underway, the Zeroday brewery's market stand in Harrisburg is typically packed all day, said manager Matt Drayer. But now, with the stools removed due to state health guidelines, the bar was empty except for employees.\u00a0 Drayer approves of the state's handling of the coronavirus but felt the federal government had failed in its response, leading the pandemic to drag on and continue slowing down business.\u00a0 \"I wish everyone would've worked together a little better at the federal level,\" he said. \"I think it could've worked out faster.\" Several of the House races to watch in Pennsylvania are those taking place in areas that were pivotal to President Trump's upset win in 2016. But in 2018, many of those districts were won by Democrats. And after protests and riots against police brutality, an ongoing fight over mail ballots and a Supreme Court vacancy, the main issue at the top of candidates' and constituents' minds is still the coronavirus and its economic blowback.\u00a0 In particular, the presidential bellwethers for the state are located in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh suburbs, as well as the state's more Republican \"T-area,\" according to county chairs of both parties. Mr. Trump saw big victories in the central and Northeast part\u00a0 of the state, cancelling any Democratic advantages in the metropolitan suburbs.\u00a0 The 10th District race just east of the state's \"T area,\" between Democrat Eugene DePasquale and Republican incumbent Scott Perry, may share the most similarities with the Trump-Biden race.\u00a0 Mr. Trump won this South Central district by 9 points in 2016, though the past few months of polls have shown a consistent single-digit lead for both DePasquale and Biden. The latest CBS poll conducted at the end of September shows Vice President Biden with a 7-point lead statewide. DePasquale has shared the ballot with Biden and Trump before, winning his election for state auditor in 2012 and his reelection in 2016. He has anchored his campaign on pragmatism, pointing to his experience as state auditor and in the state legislature while critiquing D.C. gridlock on a stimulus package. \"It's going to be very competitive here,\" DePasquale told CBS News in Harrisburg. \"Clearly D.C. failed, Congressman Perry and all of D.C. failed on this pandemic response.\" \"We know it's going to be close\u2026 but we're confident when my style of leadership is put up against Congressman Perry's, we're going to win this election,\" he added. Perry, an incumbent since 2013 who hasn't led in a publicly released poll since early August, said he's not putting too much weight on the numbers. He's also not new to tight races -- his 2018 margin of victory was less than three points.\u00a0 \"Look, we've been here before. It's never easy. It's never really comfortable. We're having millions and millions of dollars in ads from Speaker Pelosi and her companions dropped into the district,\" Perry told CBS News. \"The best way we combat that and to be successful is to, again, go meet your voters face-to-face as much as possible. Understand their concerns, live the same concerns that they do, and to have them know that you have their back.\" Perry also criticized the state's Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, for his shutdowns and the state's economic woes. His campaign has also gone after DePasquale's role as state auditor, claiming he didn't do enough to investigate the Governor's COVID business waiver program, which granted permission for certain businesses to remain open at the onset of the pandemic.\u00a0 Local Republicans are bullish about Perry's chances of holding onto his seat, in part due to the substantial ground presence Republicans have in the district and a shrinking gap between the parties in statewide registration numbers. Democrats still hold a 724,000 registration advantage in the state, but Republicans have closed the gap by 200,000 voters since 2016. When asked about Mr. Trump's path to\u00a0 victory in the state, like the president, Perry pointed to a pre-COVID economy and tied DePasquale, Biden and Pelosi to \"leftist\" figures like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Acknowledging that Mr. Trump's rhetoric can turn off some voters, he said in the end, voters will have to \"juxtapose\" Trump's policies with \"how the messaging comes out.\"\u00a0 \"They have to decide, you know, if I don't like how the message is delivered, do I like what the message is? And so you have to make a decision on policy, not on whether you're going to have the President of the United States come to dinner at your home,\" he told CBS News.\u00a0 The northeastern Luzerne County, just outside Vice President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, saw one of the most dramatic swings in 2016. It went for President Obama by 5 points in 2012, then in 2016 threw its support to Mr. Trump by about 20 points. Democratic Congressman Matt Cartwright framed 2016 as a \"change\" election and said \"there was no way in God's Green Earth\" that Hillary Clinton could be seen as a change candidate. \"She was so identified with Washington politics at that point \u2026Will it be different in 2020? I think so. I just think Biden is a different candidate than Secretary Clinton,\" he told CBS News, adding Biden has clearer ties to the area, too.\u00a0 Cartwright has been in Congress since 2012 but saw his seat redistricted in 2018. Mr. Trump won this configuration of the district by almost 10 points in 2016.\u00a0 His Republican opponent, Jim Bognet, is a former Trump administration official and has aligned himself with Mr. Trump's anti-China rhetoric and support for law enforcement. During the height of the protests, Bognet aired an ad in the Portland media market encouraging its residents to move to Northeastern Pennsylvania. Jean W. Harris, a political science professor at the University of Scranton, said Mr. Trump's positive COVID-19 diagnosis and the lack of an economic stimulus package doesn't really help other Republicans on the ballot to focus on issues other than COVID-19. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted that negotiations over a COVID-19 bill wouldn't happen before the election. He pinned the blame on House Speaker Pelosi, saying she and Democrats were requesting too much money \"to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States.\" He later seemed to walk it back, calling on Congress to pass specific coronavirus relief measures.\u00a0 Harris said \"it has big impacts here if there's not another package\" and that while she expects most voters have already made up their mind, it could mobilize more Democrats.\u00a0 Patrick Purcell of WIlkes-Barre, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but said to CBS News the president's handling of the pandemic has pushed him towards Biden.\u00a0 \"I think [Trump] has to help the middle class more,\" he said. \"I think that he has to come out with regulations for COVID across the board.\"\u00a0 Larry Palumbo, an unemployed mechanic raised in Hazleton, blamed Washington for not doing enough to help low-income communities, even before the pandemic. But he especially blames congressional Democrats for the lack of action on another stimulus package.\u00a0 \"The people need it, especially people of low income that are suffering. I don't see why -- what's the reasoning behind it? People need help right now,\" he said. Palumbo didn't vote in 2016 but is leaning towards Mr. Trump this year, saying he believes he's a better leader than Biden.\u00a0 Freshman Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat, is part of the Problem Solvers caucus, a group of 50 House members who worked on a bipartisan COVID relief framework. Negotiations have stalled, but she said she'd continue to work with House Republicans on relief.\u00a0 Houlahan's 6th District seat in the western Philadelphia suburbs includes Chester County, the only Pennsylvania county to flip from Republican to Democrat in 2016. That Democratic shift continued in the 2018 midterms, when she flipped the seat by more than 17 points.\u00a0 Chester County Democratic party chair Dick Bingham predicted Biden would double Clinton's margin of victory here, in part because of the 23,000 new Democrat registrations and the local party infrastructure \"continuing to mature.\" Houlahan has a huge cash advantage for her first re-election bid, with close to $2.7 million cash on hand while her Republican opponent John Emmons had less than $200,000 by the end of July. Houlahan is \"cautiously optimistic\" about Biden's prospects in her area and the state, pointing to more voter engagement in the area. But she's still haunted by 2016.\u00a0 \"I was sitting with my popcorn and balloons, ready to watch the results of the Clinton-Trump election. And until about 9:30 at night, I thought we had that one,\" she told CBS News. \"So I am going to work until the last hour of the last day to make sure this doesn't have a history repeating itself kind of thing.\" Zak Hudak contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "It's rare for runoff elections to generate much interest among voters, but Georgia seems primed to be the exception, with its two upcoming Senate runoffs in January that will determine who controls the Senate. Republicans and Democrats are searching the state for new voters, although CBS News\u00a0exit polling\u00a0of the general election suggests neither party has much room to grow outside of their bases before the January runoffs. Time is short, with little over two weeks before early voting begins. One race pits GOP Senator Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Reverend Raphael Warnock and the other has Republican David Perdue defending his seat against Jon Ossoff.\u00a0 Trey Hood, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, thinks it's crucial for the parties to attract new voters to their coalitions to stay viable in January. Some opportunities for both parties do exist, but first, they'll likely be trying to make sure that the people who voted for them in November cast their ballots again by January 5. Despite President Trump's attacks on mail-in voting, Georgians embraced the opportunity to vote by mail amid surging COVID infections. In November, like other states, they broke mail voting records, successfully requesting and returning 1.3 million absentee ballots, a 74% return rate, while nearly 2.7 million people voted early in person. Mail-in voting is certain to be a key part of Democratic efforts in January, too. Joe Biden dominated absentee voting, with almost 850,000 votes, compared to about 451,000 for Mr. Trump. That near 2-to-1 margin helped overcome his deficit in early in-person voting \u2014 Mr. Biden had almost 1,251,000 to Mr. Trump's 1,419,000 \u2014 and in Election Day ballots, when the president received almost 588,000, compared to Mr. Biden's 367,000 votes. It's hard to predict how many will vote \u2014 and by what means \u2014 in January, but the U.S. Elections Project says nearly 825,000 people had so far requested mail-in ballots by Wednesday morning. Georgians have until January 1 to send their requests, although the U.S. Postal Service recommends sending requests as early as possible. Voters can register for the runoff until December 7, and early voting will take place beginning December 14. Most Georgians have likely already made their decisions about who's getting their vote. No voter who spoke with CBS News planned to switch votes in the January contests. A week before the November election, CBS News polling showed just 4% of likely voters were undecided in the Perdue-Ossoff race. Perdue led with 49.7% to Ossoff's 47.9%, falling just 0.3% short of outright victory. Libertarian Shane Hazel was eliminated with 2.3% of the vote.\u00a0 Perdue's vote wasn't divided between Republicans, as Senator Kelly Loeffler's was in her race, and he actually won a fraction more votes than President Trump, with 49.7%, compared to the president's 49.3%. Ossoff finished with 47.9% support, leaving him about a two-point margin to make up in January.\u00a0 In the other Senate race, the special election to fill former Senator Johnny Isakson's seat, Loeffler and Collins won a combined 45% of the vote, ahead of Warnock's 32.9%. The other Democratic candidates received 15% combined. Dorothy Harpe, 70, was in the majority of voters who knew who she was supporting before the election. A longtime Republican, Harpe said she voted for Perdue and Loeffler. And she'll support them again in the runoffs. \"Senator Perdue has been there a long time and he is experienced,\" said Harpe, who lives in Atlanta. \"I don't think we need the other candidate, Jon Ossoff, because he's not qualified. He's not experienced.\" Longtime Democrat Latreana Johnson, 63, of Savannah, first spoke with CBS News in October, during the early voting period. She voted for Warnock and Ossoff then and said she plans to do so again in a few weeks. Voting for Ossoff was an easy call for her \u2014 because of one consequential endorsement. \"Barack Obama is backing him up 100% and you can't go wrong with Barack Obama, so I'm backing whoever he backs up,\" said Johnson. As was the case in the presidential race, White voters in Georgia, who make up 61% of the Georgia electorate and who mostly supported President Trump, largely went for Perdue, too, at 69%, but he underperformed with this group, compared to his last Senate bid in 2014, when he won 74% of their votes. In her race, Loeffler won the larger share of support from White voters (42%), outpacing the other Republican in the race, Congressman Doug Collins, who received 28% support. Perdue won White voters with college degrees, though his margins with this group are much lower compared to his last bid. In 2014, Perdue won 70% of White college graduates, while this year he won significantly less: 56%.\u00a0 Jeramy Frederiksen, 39, has a degree in economics and said he voted for Perdue and Loeffler because they best represent his conservative values. \"It was a no-brainer for me,\" said Frederiksen. \"The conservative value kind of gears more toward the working man and woman with personal responsibility, God...and those are signs of strength.\"\u00a0 Hood, who is also the director of the Survey Research Center at the University of Georgia, said there's been a shift in the base of both political parties. \"You probably have a larger percentage of college-educated White [voters] that are still Republican in Georgia compared to, say, Wisconsin or something,\" said Hood. \"It's very interesting that the base of the parties has switched in terms of sort of working class being sort of the base of the Republican Party now.\" Georgia Republicans and Democrats largely voted within their party, but both Ossoff and Warnock also performed well with independents in November. They won 51% and 37% of independent voters, respectively. Six percent of independents chose Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel over Ossoff or Perdue.\u00a0 In the Perdue-Ossoff match-up, among the 38% of voters who identify as moderates, Ossoff won 63% of their votes, while Perdue won just 34%. \"Things are pretty evenly split in terms of vote totals between the Republicans and the Democrats, so someone's going to have to reach out and get some new voters for their coalition to stay viable, and for both [parties] it could be Hispanic voters,\" said Hood.\u00a0 Both parties are likely to target Latino voters, too, who were more divided in their support for the Democratic candidates. Nearly a third went for Reverend Raphael Warnock, while 26% voted for the other Democratic candidate, Matt Lieberman. Overall, Latinos constituted 7% of the state's electorate in November. Ossoff received less support from Latino voters (52%) than President-elect Biden, who earned 62% of the Latino vote in Georgia, while Perdue performed better with Latinos than President Trump, winning 43% of the vote. Mr. Trump won 37% of the Latino vote in the state. And while Hazel received just about 2% of the overall vote, he did pick up 4% of the Latino vote. \"The Hispanic population is growing and continuing to grow in Georgia, whereas the white population is contracting to some degree and the Black populations [are] fairly stable, growing slightly,\" Hood said.\u00a0 Hood says Black turnout is \"critical to the Democratic coalition.\" He recalled, \"In the last statewide Senate election runoff we had in 2008 with Saxby Chambliss, I did the calculations, and Black turnout from the general, from the 2008 general to the runoff dropped by three points. So, that was very high.\" Chambliss won the runoff by nearly 15 points, \"and a lot of it was due to that falloff in Black turnout,\" Hood said, adding, \"if that happens again, that's going to be very detrimental to the Democratic candidates in the runoff.\" Black voters make up 29% of the Georgia electorate, and 88% voted for Mr. Biden. Black women overwhelmingly voted for Jon Ossoff \u2014 similar to the presidential race, where Mr. Biden garnered 92% of votes cast by Black women in Georgia. The majority of Black voters also went for Warnock. Johnson said Warnock appealed to her because of his life experiences. \"He can relate. Period,\" said Johnson. \"He grew up in one of the major projects here in Savannah, Georgia...he had a lot of brothers and sisters and everything, and the bottom line is that [he] can relate to our struggle.\"\u00a0 Republicans have another challenge before them in that the top members of their party, including President Trump and the two Republicans running for Senate, have been sowing doubts about the election system and any Republican who vouched for it, including Georgia's governor and secretary of state. And it remains to be seen whether the GOP can now convince its voters to show up again in January to participate in a process they have worked to undermine. \"It's the integrity of the system that is absolutely 100% my concern,\" said Frederiksen, who lives outside of Warner Robins. \"If we lose this fair and square, so be it. OK, America voted that way, which I don't believe they did.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump will spend the next few days at Walter Reed National Medical Center after testing positive for COVID-19 and showing \"mild symptoms.\" He\u00a0tweeted a video\u00a0message from the White House before departing for the hospital. \"I want to thank everybody for the tremendous support. I'm going to Walter Reed hospital. I think I'm doing very well,\" he said. \"But we're going to make sure that things work out. The First Lady is doing very well. So thank you very much, I appreciate it, I will never forget it - thank you.\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany released a statement Friday explaining that \"out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.\" The revelation of President Trump's positive coronavirus test result shocked the world and is roiling a presidential campaign cycle that has already seen historic disruptions -- a prolonged presidential impeachment battle, the onset of the pandemic, natural disasters, and protests across the country about the deaths of Black people at the hands of police. And it's now hurtling towards the finish line with the president and First Lady Melania Trump testing positive for COVID-19. On Friday morning, hours after receiving their results, President Trump, 74, had \"mild symptoms\" but remained \"energetic\" and \"in good spirits,\" chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters at the White House. Meadows added that \"doctors continue to monitor both his health and the health of the First Lady.\" At the White House, a senior official described the mood and atmosphere to\u00a0CBS News White House producer Fin Gomez\u00a0as \"pretty scary.\" Another said it was \"crazy\" adding that there has been a lot of prayer from the staff for the first couple. With less than five weeks until Election Day, President Trump is now quarantining and his previously scheduled in-person campaign events are being postponed or moved to virtual formats. Campaign events involving members of the first family are also being postponed, according to Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien. \"All other campaign events will be considered on a case-by-case basis,\" Stepien said. Earlier on Friday in an email, Stepien urged staffers who had been in contact with anyone who had contracted the virus to self-quarantine, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"Any campaign staffer who has had exposure to someone testing positive should immediately begin self-quarantine,\" Stepien said in the email. The campaign manager added that staffers who have not exhibited symptoms did not need to self-quarantine, but should still take precautionary measures such as wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing. \"While some public events will be taken down, the campaign office remains open and our nationwide team will continue with our efforts to re-elect President Trump,\" Stepien said. Mr. Trump has appeared at several campaign rallies recently where there was limited social distancing and where masks were not required. When pressed about his crowded rallies during the first presidential debate on Tuesday, Mr. Trump noted that many of his events had been held outdoors, which is considered safer for group gatherings. However, the president has also held some events indoors in recent months, including an indoor rally in Nevada last month. Vice President Pence, who was in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump on Tuesday before the debate, tested negative, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. In a memo, the vice president's physician wrote that Pence is \"not considered a close contact with any individuals who tested positive,\" including President Trump. Pence's physician added that the vice president doesn't need to quarantine and is \"free to go about his normal activities.\" Stepien said Pence \"plans on resuming his scheduled campaign events.\" An administration official says Pence is currently at the U.S. Naval Observatory and remains in good health. The VP's press secretary Devin O'Malley added that Mr. Pence \"wishes the Trumps well in their recovery.\" While the president recovers from a deadly virus, a senior Trump campaign adviser told\u00a0Sganga\u00a0there is uncertainty as to what campaigning will look like in the near future. \"There has not been a definitive answer as to after [President Trump] has quarantined and this virus has run its course, what [campaigning] looks like,\" the senior campaign advisor said. The senior advisor added that the president is a \"prolific communicator\" and we can expect to hear from him \"within the next 14 days.\" From the time he broke the news about his positive test results late last night, he did not tweet again until Friday evening, just before he left for Walter Reed. It is unclear who the president has been in contact with in the days prior to his positive test result. Testing negative for COVID-19 only indicates that a person is not shedding the virus at the time of testing, and the incubation period for coronavirus can span up to 14 days. Hours before President Trump announced his diagnosis, President Trump's counselor and confidant Hope Hicks tested positive for COVID-19. Hicks spent two days traveling alongside the president to Ohio and Minnesota. President Trump attended two fundraisers in the past 48 hours, delivering remarks to donors at private events in Minneapolis and Bedminster, New Jersey. According to Republican sources, attendees at both events were tested for COVID-19 and signed legal waivers before attending both campaign events. \"Every guest was at least six feet from the president at all times,\" a senior Republican National Committee official told CBS News. \"The event site was professionally cleaned and sanitized prior to the event,\" the official added. But according to attendees inside, masks were not required. Among others, President Trump traveled this week with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., senior adviser Dan Scavino, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Trump campaign aide Jason Miller, Trump campaign chairman Bill Stepien, Former Governor Chris Christie, Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trump counselor Derek Lyons. Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Meadows, McEnany, Jordan and Giuliani have so far tested negative for COVID-19. Meanwhile,\u00a0CBS political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0report\u00a0that Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris went ahead with their Friday campaign schedule, once receiving negative tests by early afternoon. The candidates' spouses, Dr. Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff, also both tested negative and plan to stay on the trail. While the Friday schedule was pushed back, Biden was able to travel to Grand Rapids, Michigan, while Harris traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada for a voter mobilization drive-in event. Biden boarded his campaign plane this afternoon and flew off to Michigan after two COVID-19 tests came back negative. Speaking outside a union hall in Grand Rapids, MI, he wore a mask the entire time. Biden said, \"Sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and the president. This is not a matter of politics. It's a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It's not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible.\" He also said that the president's illness is a reminder the nation needs to improve access to COVID tests, adding, \"It's not just the folks in the White House or who travel with me who deserve regular testing. it's folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants. Grocery store workers. every single American deserves safety and peace of mind.\" But in a sign he's not immediately changing his campaign strategy, Biden also called out Friday's jobs report -- the final one of the campaign season -- that reported just 661,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent. \"I'm grateful for all of those who were able to get their jobs back to work again but there are fewer jobs than we had hoped for,\" Biden said. Biden's team goes to great lengths to protect the 77-year old candidate from the virus. He spent most of the summer addressing supporters virtually from a basement TV studio. His campaign says he only began taking COVID tests in late August. His limited in-person events include just a handful of COVID-screened staff, reporters and invited guests. A senior Biden aide texted\u00a0O'Keefe\u00a0that it's too early to know the political impact of Trump's diagnosis, \"but certainly [there's] going to be a lot of convos today about potential impact, what changes we make if any, etc.\" Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon emailed campaign staffers nationwide, reassuring them that precautions will be taken with Biden and Harris traveling. She also instructed campaign staffers to \"refrain from posting about the situation on social media unless otherwise directed by your manager. We will share additional information and guidance with you as we have it.\" CBS News confirmed with two campaign officials that the Biden campaign is in the process of pulling down negative ads hitting President Trump for a to-be-determined time, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. This decision came this afternoon in consultation with the former vice president and top advisers. According to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group tracking, the Biden campaign does not appear to have canceled ad buys all together. However, a review of Facebook's ad library found a number of negative ads had been deactivated as of this afternoon. Friday morning, before Biden campaign officials said they were pulling negative ads, the campaign had a new TV ad air for the first time in Pittsburgh featuring a local business owner who took aim at Mr. Trump. In it, a small business owner spoke about the effects of COVID on his business, saying, \"Trump does not see me.\" It's not clear how long the Biden campaign plans to pull the negative ads. One of the areas to keep an eye on in Wisconsin on election night are the so-called BOW counties in northeastern Wisconsin, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster,\u00a0including Brown, home to Green Bay, Outagamie, home to Appleton, and Winnebago, home to Oshkosh. The counties have been a key battleground, where Republicans have a solid presence, but Democrats are fighting to cut into their margins. The counties are made up of many working class residents, the Green Bay area still has a large chunk of manufacturing jobs, and rural voters. In 2008, when Barack Obama won Wisconsin by 13.9 points, he carried the BOW counties by 10.8 points. Two years later, when Obama still won Wisconsin comfortably, but by a smaller margin, Mitt Romney carried the three counties by about a quarter of a point. In 2016's razor-thin election, President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 10.3 points, showing his strength with white working class and rural voters. In 2018, former Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker won by about 7.8 points, his smallest margins during any of his three general elections. That helped Democratic Governor Tony Evers narrowly win the governor's mansion. That 2018 election saw a shift toward Democrats in the cities, while the surrounding more rural areas, remained solidly Republican, said Charles Franklin, Marquette Law School Poll Director. The shift in the cities has made the region competitive in 2020, and Franklin said Biden has cut into Mr. Trump's margins in the Green Bay media market, which the president won by more than 15 points in 2016. Michael Moran, chair of the Brown County Democrats, said his party has seen intense motivation to vote against President Trump, something that's fired up Democratic voters around the country. Brown County is one of the country's major COVID-19 hot spots and hospitals in the county are near capacity. Moran said the county has struggled with COVID-19 since the pandemic began and that's put issues like health insurance in the spotlight, especially for people who lost their job and insurance due to the pandemic. \"COVID exposed a lot of sort of underlying problems that have been just sort of latent in our society, that as long as things are going good enough and the employment rate is good enough, just don't really bubble to the surface,\" Moran said. Brown County Republican Chair James Fitzgerald said his party has seen a 50% increase in membership over the past couple of years, including some former Democrats signing up. \"We are finding more and more Democrats coming in, many of which are telling us this will be the first time in their life that they are going to vote Republican,\" Fitzgerald said. \"And for many of them, it's a very emotional experience.\" The issues motivating many of those voters and Republicans in the county, include the economy, trade and the president's support for law and order, Fitzgerald said. Democrats were thrilled when Jill Karofsky, the liberal candidate for Supreme Court, won the BOW counties in the April election. But Franklin, the Marquette Poll Director, cautions against reading too much into that considering there was still a somewhat competitive Democratic presidential primary. \"We didn't turn out our vote,\" Fitzgerald said, something he doesn't expect to be an issue in the general election. He laughed when he said that won't be a problem for Republicans in November with Mr. Trump on the ticket. Moran said he hasn't paid much attention to the polls and wants to see voter contact efforts reach as many people as possible over the next month, even if they have to be virtual. \"We need to fight for every single vote,\" Moran said. The nation's highest court is set to consider arguments over Arizona's ban on so-called \"ballot harvesting\" and voters casting ballots in a wrong precinct, granting a petition to hear the case\u00a0by Arizona Republicans\u00a0and the\u00a0state's attorney general. While an appeals court had\u00a0ruled in January\u00a0to undo the measures, agreeing with Democrats who had first argued ahead of the 2016 election that the laws violated the Voting Rights Act,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0notes\u00a0the restrictions remain in effect pending the Supreme Court's decision. The case adds to an already busy year of court battles over the election being waged in the battleground state, including an eleventh-hour plea this week by a Latino advocacy group to postpone the state's voter registration deadline this Monday. Mi Familia Vota, which is also suing in federal court over election policies in Texas,\u00a0in a complaint filed Wednesday\u00a0argued that Arizona's COVID-19 restrictions had \"dramatically\" hampered voter registration efforts. The group says remote outreach efforts yielded less than 200 voters per week on average during the pandemic, down from averaging more than a thousand in the weeks before. California Democratic Congressman TJ Cox, who recently called himself \"the most vulnerable Democrat in Congress,\" is now looking to hire paid canvassers, according to an email exclusively obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. The email appears to have come from the Fresno State College Democrats and reads that the Cox campaign is looking for people interested in paid canvassing positions. It includes a positing directly from the Cox campaign which reads \"we're looking to hire people who are to work 5 hour shifts, at $15 an hour, and all you would need is a smartphone and possible access to a car, though carpooling might be a possibility if they feel comfortable doing so, but that's still yet to be hashed out.\" It also includes a contact with the campaign for those interested to reach out. This comes after Cox sent a fundraising email to supporters slamming Republicans on the same issue. In a fundraising email sent last month, Cox wrote that \"their latest ploy is spending $100k to send paid canvassers door to door in the middle of a pandemic.\" A spokesperson for the Cox campaign did not respond to a request for comment today. Cox barely defeated Republican incumbent David Valado by 902 votes in 2018. The two are headed for a rematch in November, which is expected to be a competitive race once again. A spokesperson for Joe Biden's campaign says it still intends to resume sending volunteers knocking doors in Nevada's Clark and Washoe counties, pending final protocols being hashed out by staff for the local party's coordinated campaign, among several state Democratic teams slated to resume in-person voter contacts across the country. The decision comes as Nevada Republicans, who resumed in-person campaign efforts months ago, have celebrated another straight month outpacing Democrats\u00a0in new voter registrations. However, Democrats in Nevada still outnumber Republicans by 88,459 voters, slightly larger than the lead of 77,467 voters that Democrats had recorded in\u00a0October 2016, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"For the third month in a row, the Nevada Republican Party has grown and outpaced Democrats in voter registration,\" Keith Schipper, spokesperson for Trump Victory, said in a statement. \"President Trump has delivered for Nevadans and voters can see that Joe Biden and Democrats are only offering lawlessness and failed socialist ideas that would decimate the Silver State.\" Ohio Governor Mike DeWine held a press conference this afternoon to comment on President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump testing positive for COVID-19. DeWine said the positive tests are a \"powerful reminder to us that we have to do the basic things.\" DeWine, a Republican, said, \"We have to wear a mask.\" He added, \"We have to social distance. We have to be careful. We have to avoid big crowds.\" DeWine also remarked on the possibility of future in-person campaign events in Ohio, a battleground state. Cleveland recently hosted the first presidential debate. Mr. Trump held two in-person campaign events in the state on September 21 and Democratic nominee Joe Biden held an in-person campaign event in Alliance, Ohio as a part of his whistle-stop train tour. \"I wouldn't say that campaigns need to completely shut down,\" DeWine added. \"I just think they need to be careful and be compliant with what we request everybody to do. And that is just be careful, keep that distance, wear a mask.\" Ohio's Democratic congressional delegation wrote a letter to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose urging him to implement safety recommendations to ensure the health and safety of Ohio voters and poll workers in the November general election. The lawmakers cited the safety recommendations from over 200 medical professionals, faith leaders and voting rights advocates. The lawmakers specifically made six recommendations for LaRose to implement. Some of those recommendations include: social distancing measures inside and outside a polling location, requiring poll workers and voters to wear a face covering when inside a polling location, requiring voters to use hand sanitizer when entering and exiting a polling location and placing a plastic barrier between a poll worker and a voter where an interaction is expected to be longer than one minute. \"As Ohio's Secretary of State, it is your responsibility to ensure that all Ohioans have access to safe in-person voting options and that poll workers, the backbone of our democracy, are afforded every health and safety precaution in this upcoming election,\" the Democratic lawmakers wrote. \"You have an urgent obligation to communicate the steps you are proactively taking to instill confidence in the machinery of democracy.\" The city of Columbus is making plans to encourage city employees to work the November general election. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, Columbus city council president Shannon Hardin and Franklin County board of elections director Ed Leonard made the announcement Friday morning. Under the program, named the Precinct Election Official Leave Program, city employees, who meet certain requirements, such as living in Columbus and are registered voters in Franklin County, \"may request Election Official Leave with pay for the purposes of being a judge of an election engaged by the Franklin County Board of Elections.\" Ginther added, \"I am pleased that city employees - every one of them a public servant - will be able to choose to participate as poll workers, if they so desire, without having to use vacation time.\" The city of Philadelphia is pushing back against a lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign late Thursday night against the city's Board of Elections which is stopping Trump campaign representatives from watching voters register, fill out or return mail ballots at satellite elections offices, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. \"The claims of this lawsuit are baseless and the City will defend against this and any other such efforts to tie the election up in the Courts,\" Chief of Staff to City Solicitor Marcel S. Pratt said in a statement. The night before, echoing the president himself, lawyers for the campaign wrote that \"Bad things are happening in Philadelphia,\" and asked a county court to force the Philadelphia commissioners to allow poll watchers in those offices. The Philadelphia commissioners and the secretary of the commonwealth have been clear in recent days that they do not interpret the law to say satellite elections offices, as opposed to official polling places, require poll watchers. In the first general election where any Pennsylvania voter can cast their ballot by mail without an excuse, Philadelphia has opened 7 of a planned 15 satellite elections offices where voters can register, request what's technically a mail ballot, receive it, fill it out and return it in a single trip. \"To be clear: the satellite offices are not polling places and the Pennsylvania Election Code does not create a right for campaign representatives to \"watch\" at these locations,\" Pratt said. COVID-19 Several House members who were at the presidential debate on Tuesday or traveled with Mr. Trump this week have been tested for COVID-19 today. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that at least 11 House members were tested today, with many getting negative test results. Both House campaign committee chairs, Democrat Cheri Bustos and Republican Tom Emmer tested negative after being tested Friday morning. Bustos was in attendance at Tuesday's debate, while Emmer was with Trump on Air Force One during the flight to his Duluth, Minnesota rally. Minnesota Republicans Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber were also on that flight, but both tested negative. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congressmen Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Tim Ryan of Ohio also all tested negative after taking tests on Friday. Both Gallego and Ryan went to Tuesday's debate. Ohio Republicans Jim Jordan and Mike Turner were also in contact with Trump this week, but tested negative on Friday. QANON The House overwhelmingly passed Democrat Congressman Tom Malinowski's bipartisan resolution condemning QAnon on Friday, 371 to 18. Independent Justin Amash and 17 Republican lawmakers voted against the resolution, which officially condemns the\u00a0conspiracy theory network. Another GOP lawmaker voted present. Navarro\u00a0reports that the vote comes after Malinowski\u00a0had been receiving death threats\u00a0from QAnon followers this week, due to his resolution and an advertisement being pushed by Republicans claiming he lobbied to \"protect sexual predators.\" In a statement from his re-election campaign Friday, campaign manager Daniel Fleiss said the resolution's passing \"resoundingly affirmed that conspiracy movements, misinformation campaigns, and anti-Semitic groups have no place in our politics.\" He added that Malinowski will continue to work with \"responsible members of the Republican Party\" to combat QAnon, while his Republican opponent Tom Kean Jr. \"is working with the arsonists in his party to amplify it.\" In a statement yesterday, Kean Jr.'s campaign condemned the death threats but said the congressman is \"wrong to attempt to lay the blame at the feet of Senator Kean.\" CAMPAIGN CASH As soon as October 1 hit and the third quarter officially passed, many House campaigns began releasing their quarterly fundraising numbers. Navarro\u00a0reports that Republican challenger Nancy Mace outraised incumbent Democrat Joe Cunningham in South Carolina's 1st, with $2.3 million raised from July through September compared to Cunningham's $1.8 million. Democrat Hillary Scholten raked in roughly $500,000 more than Republican Peter Meijer, with $1.5 million raised. Both are competing for Michigan's 3rd district, left open by independent Congressman Justin Amash. Democrat Amy Kennedy, running against Republican Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey's 2nd District, brought in $2.2 million in the quarter. Republican Wesley Hunt, who is challenging Democrat freshman Lizzie Fletcher in a Houston-area seat, raised $3 million in the quarter.",

            "article_content": "CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of Americans in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic has forced California small business owner Stephanie Mufson to make dramatic changes to survive. In July, she told\u00a0CBS News\u00a0she wasn't sure if her company Parade Guys, which builds floats and large displays for outdoor festivals would make it.\u00a0 Mufson,\u00a0an independent artist, typically works with a team of contractors who are experts at painting, sculpting, and building floats for outdoor festivals and parades in the San Francisco Bay Area. But in the last six months, festivals like the San Francisco Pride Parade and Fourth of July celebrations did not take place in person, resulting in economic hardship for the independent contractors who rely on those outdoor festivals for work.\u00a0 \"It is not the same world that I spent most of my life basing my career around,\" Mufson said, adding that \"to survive and thrive, you have to adapt.\" As the demand for floats has dropped off, Mufson has been taking advantage of the down time to acquire new skills to exploit her background as a professional artist. She's enrolled in a full-time graduate school program with a focus on meeting the growing digital demands of the art industry.\u00a0 In a typical summer, Mufson said her team would build floats and displays for a dozen different parades and celebrations. This summer she said she's only had a couple of freelance projects and is teaching online art classes to help pay the bills.\u00a0 San Francisco's support during the pandemic has meant a lot to Mufson. \"The City has been so generous with us and they've been really supportive and understanding of the fact that obviously we can't pay rent because we don't have business,\" Mufson said.\u00a0 San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently announced an extension of the eviction moratorium, giving small businesses that bring in less than $25 million a year until December 1 to make rent payments.\u00a0 Mufson said she is \"grateful to live in a city that sees the value in what we do,\" and added that she's hopeful protections from evictions can continue \"until we can get back to work.\" When the pandemic forced the cancellation of large outdoor gatherings, Mufson brainstormed creative ways to make parades feasible, even when people still fear infection. One idea gaining some traction, she said, is setting up a drive-through parade.\u00a0 Instead of floats driving by the hundreds of thousands of people that usually gather on the streets of San Francisco, Mufson wants to keep the floats in place so families can drive through the route, stop for photos, and move on to the next one while remaining safe in their vehicles.\u00a0 \"Hopefully, this will give artists some work and create an opportunity for people to have an engaging experience through a more socially distant medium,\" Mufson said. Brain Travis, who works with Mufson at Parade Guys and is also a musician, has been connecting with other musicians remotely to produce songs. In July, he told CBS News that producing weekly online music events was helping him buy groceries while he was out of work. Travis said he spent several months learning new software programs to efficiently livestream a weekly show. He added that live streaming content \"is another way that people are going to consume media\" and \"to stay relevant\" he had to figure it out as well.\u00a0 Between now and Election Day, Travis said he plans to continue producing weekly music shows to livestream and help keep him afloat. Travis said he applied for unemployment assistance four months ago and has yet to receive any benefits.\u00a0 More than five million Californians applied for traditional unemployment benefits between March and September, according to the state's Employment Development Department. Additionally, more than 4 million applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program during the same time.\u00a0 The PUA covers business owners, self-employed workers, and independent contractors who may not be covered under the traditional unemployment assistance program.\u00a0 Travis said, \"the systems we have in place have not really helped me because it's now three and a half, almost four months and I still haven't received unemployment.\" Travis said he made regular calls to the state's unemployment line to figure out what was causing the delay in receiving the funds. For weeks he couldn't get through the automated message and said he had to rely on tips and tricks that users posted on a forum on Reddit to get a state representative on the line.\u00a0 \"You've got to actually figure out a hack in order to get in touch and talk to somebody,\" Travis said. He added that when he finally got \"a carbon-based life form on the line\" the individual \"sounded really overwhelmed\" but helped settle an error that was causing the delay in disbursement of funds.\u00a0 \"Apparently now I'm going to be getting payments soon, but they don't make it easy,\" Travis said. In July, Travis told CBS News that as an independent artist, he's used to living on a low budget. But he said, \"you can't just sit there and hope that things are going to work out.\" While work at Parade Guys is limited to a few hours a week cleaning up the mess left behind from previous projects prior to the pandemic, Travis said he's continuing to make videos, bringing new audiences to his\u00a0YouTube page, and picking up freelance graphic design projects. \"You have to have radical trust but always be throwing train tracks ahead of your train,\" Travis said. \"You have to actually be actively seeking out the opportunities,\" he added.

            "article_content": "Senator Bernie Sanders' campaign announced Sunday it raised $46.5 million in February, the most of any Democratic presidential candidate in a given month in the 2020 election cycle. The figure shatters the previous monthly record of $25 million, set by the Sanders campaign in January. According to the campaign, the cash haul came from more than 2.2 million donations, including contributions from more than 350,000 donors who were giving to the campaign for the first time. The Vermont senator's fundraising efforts were fueled by victories in the early primary states of New Hampshire and Nevada, and a first-place finish in the popular vote in Iowa. Senator Elizabeth Warren also announced her February fundraising numbers on Sunday, saying she pulled in $29 million, a record for her campaign.\u00a0 Since February 2019, Sanders has raised more than $167 million from 1.9 million people who made 8.7 million contributions, surpassing the total number of individual contributions given to Sanders' 2016 presidential bid. About $4.5 million poured in on Saturday, the final day of February, making it his single best fundraising day to date even as he came in second to Joe Biden in the South Carolina primary. In an interview on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Sanders said his fundraising prowess gives him the edge over his Democratic rivals and would allow him to compete against President Trump in the general election. \"We have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday but to take us through the entire process, fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country,\" Sanders said. The campaign said 99.9% of Sanders' donors have not reached the federal limit on individual contributions, meaning they can give again. The average donation in February was $21. \"The senator's multigenerational, multiracial working class coalition keeps fueling his campaign for transformational change a few bucks at a time,\" campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. \"We're especially proud that of the more than 2 million donations we received this month, over 1.4 million were from voters in states that vote on Super Tuesday.\" Along with announcing its record cash haul, Sanders' campaign also said it would begin buying television ads in nine states with primary contests on March 10 and 17, including Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Washington, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.\u00a0 According to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group, Sanders is second only to Michael Bloomberg in spending on TV and radio ads in Super Tuesday states. The group has tracked more than $16 million in ad spending in those states heading into the March 3 contests. Sanders' campaign said it's currently on the air in 12 out of the 14 states voting that day. Warren's campaign said it raised $2.8 million of her $29 million total on the day of Warren's well-received debate performance in Nevada on February 19. According to Warren campaign manager Roger Lau, 250,000 people donated for the first time in February, bringing the campaign's total number of donors since its launch to more than 1.25 million. The average February donation was $31.\u00a0 Warren's campaign also said it was increasing its Super Tuesday ad spending to $2.4 million. The campaign invested more than $4.1 million in media in every state that votes later in March and Wisconsin, which votes April 7, as well as a $700,000 in radio, print and mail to key constituencies across March voting states. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's campaign said it raised $5 million on Saturday as the former vice president won South Carolina, eliciting contributions from \"tens of thousands of new supporters.\" Biden has not yet released his fundraising numbers for the entire month. Presidential candidates have a deadline of March 20 to file fundraising and spending reports with the Federal Election Commission.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris will take the debate stage Wednesday night in Salt Lake City where the stakes are unusually high for a vice-presidential debate,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq\u00a0Bidar\u00a0reports. Both the Biden and Harris campaign remain in negotiations ahead of the showdown. Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0Tuesday, \"Both campaigns agreed to a 12-foot separation seated at the table, which is double the recommended distance.\" A release by the commission Monday stated, \"Plexiglass will be used as part of the [Commission on Presidential Debate's] overall approach to health and safety.\" The request was made by the Biden-Harris campaign and approved by the CPD,\u00a0CBS Campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0confirmed. However a senior official close to the vice president confirms Mr. Pence does not want plexiglass on his side of the stage, adding that CDC guidance recommends plexiglass only when a six-foot distance between individuals isn't possible. The CPD says that there will be a \"small number\" of ticketed guests at the debate, which will take place at the University of Utah. Those in the debate hall will be required to take COVID tests and use masks. Anyone not wearing a mask \"will be escorted out,\" the CPD said. At the first presidential debate last week, President Trump's family declined to\u00a0wear masks\u00a0in the debate hall. After a cantankerous first debate between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, political strategists feel the vice presidential candidates will bring more substance to the table. \"We have vice presidential nominees that are younger and presumably healthier than the presidential nominees so there's a greater than normal chance that one of these two will be President of the United States,\" longtime Republican strategist Michael Steel told\u00a0Bidar. David Kotchel, who ran Mitt Romney's Iowa operations in 2008 and 2012, said \"there's more awareness among voters that this debate is more important than it has been in past years.\" On Thursday of last week, before President Trump's diagnosis and eventual hospitalizations,\u00a0Bidar\u00a0spoke with Republican officials and strategists to examine Pence's role with the campaign now and how he can set himself up for 2024. You can read that article\u00a0here. One day after leaving Walter Reed Medical Center to return to the White House, President Trump continued to downplay the risks of the coronavirus, while his doctor said the president is reporting \"no symptoms\" of COVID-19. Hours after the medical team treating him for\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0cautioned that he's \"not out of the woods yet,\" on Monday, Mr. Trump returned to White House shortly before 7 p.m., where he took off his mask and gave a thumbs up before walking inside. He soon\u00a0tweeted\u00a0a minute-long video from the balcony, saying he'd \"learned so much about coronavirus\" and that he might be immune to it. \"One thing that's for certain: Don't let it dominate you,\" he said of COVID-19. \"Don't be afraid of it. You're going to beat it.\" In a\u00a0post shared on Twitter\u00a0and Facebook Tuesday morning, the president once again compared COVID-19 to the flu, which has proven much less lethal and contagious than the coronavirus. Overstating the yearly death toll from the flu, Mr. Trump said Americans \"have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid.\" More than 210,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Twitter\u00a0flagged\u00a0the tweet, saying it violated the platform's rules about \"spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.\" Facebook removed it entirely.\u00a0 President Trump expressed interest in going to the Oval Office Tuesday because he \"feels good,\" but protective measures are not in place for that to happen yet.\u00a0CBS News White House correspondent Ben Tracy\u00a0reports the White House is still creating a working space for him in the Map Room, which he will also likely use for taped video addresses and any television appearances. White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah said Tuesday that Americans \"will likely hear from President Trump\" later today. Mr. Trump also\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Tuesday that he has instructed his representatives to stop negotiating with House Democrats on a long-anticipated coronavirus stimulus package until after the election. The president accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of \"not negotiating in good faith,\" but such a public declaration that the White House has ended negotiations on desperately needed aid to small businesses could hurt the president's re-election prospects, 28 days out. As for the president's future debate appearance, the Trump campaign tells\u00a0CBS News reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0the president intends to debate in-person, in Miami on October 15. \"We will of course be relying on his medical team from Walter Reed and the White House medical unit,\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CBS News, Tuesday. In his 21-minute speech at Gettysburg, Joe Biden did not mention President Trump's name even one time, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. But Biden was clearly talking about the president's leadership on the several crises the country is facing today: the COVID-19 pandemic, racial injustice, the economic slump and climate change. Biden wove together quotes from Lincoln and said today's \"battle for the soul of America\" -- Biden's long-held campaign slogan -- was like the division after the Civil War. \"Today once again we are a house divided. But that my friends can no longer be. We are facing too many crises,\" Biden said. \"As I look across America today, I am concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life not as an arena for mediation of our differences but rather they see it as an occasion for total unrelenting partisan warfare.\" In the historic setting, Biden shifted focus to current day fights over safety. \"I do not believe that we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both.\" On the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden said, \"This pandemic is not a red state or blue state issue. This virus doesn't care whether you live - where you live or what political party you belong to. It affects us all, it will take anyone's life. It's a virus, it's not a political weapon.\" Overall, this is the well-tuned version of Biden's stump speech from the primaries. This unity message has been overshadowed in recent weeks as the Democratic nominee focused on addressing current issues, but today -- with the famous battle backdrop - he was able to put this all together. In a state that has been considered a battleground in recent presidential election years, one area that has consistently been considered a Republican stronghold is Duval County in Florida, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. Home to Jacksonville -- the state's largest city by population -- Duval County is considered by some Florida political scientists to be \"quite polarized\" in terms of race and political party. With a county supervisor of elections that is considered by some to be \"not as proactive\" as some of the elections supervisors in other large counties in the state, both Democrats and Republicans agree that this county with a population of nearly one million residents is not one to be ignored. Former Democratic Florida Representative Mia Jones, who represented a district within Duval County at the state level for eight years, said for many years Duval County has had very close races, making the area a target for candidates running for office who are now putting a great deal of effort in appealing to voters in the county and its surrounding areas. \"A lot of people who are registered Democrat and for a number of years because of the landscape of the state, they have voted Republican,\" said Jones. \"But they have realized that they really lean more toward the Democratic values, and as a result, they are coming back to where they're comfortable.\" Republican Florida Representative Cord Byrd has represented parts of Duval County as a state representative for the past four years, and is up for re-election this cycle. Byrd said that his party has been a \"victim of its own success\" in Duval County and that Duval Republicans in some ways started to take the Republican-leaning nature of the county for granted, a move that Byrd said Democrats maximized. \"After the 2016 election, [Democrats] didn't shut down their operations and continued,\" said Byrd. \"I think the Republican Party obviously is aware of that now and are making changes and are making great strides and realize that we can't take Duval County for granted anymore.\" Byrd added that Republicans still hold the mayor's office in Duval's county seat of Jacksonville and that while Republicans have maintained control in the county, Democrats are fighting for power, which makes the area a competitive region in the state. \"When you look at the state...Duval County certainly is one of the largest Republican-controlled areas,\" said Byrd. \"Candidates recognize that, they recognize that there are a lot of votes here, that the people are motivated in turnout.\" According to data compiled by the Duval County Supervisor of Elections office, turnout in the county has been at least 68% in the past five presidential elections dating back to 2000. Though the Republican presidential candidates won each of these contests, political scientists point to narrowing margins of victory and changing demographics in the county as signs of a changing tide. In 2016, Trump won Duval County by less than 6,000 votes -- or just more than 1% -- a decrease from the 1.9% that Republican John McCain beat Democrat Barack Obama by in 2008, and the 3.6% that Republican Mitt Romney beat Mr. Obama by in 2012. Democrats also point to the 2018 midterm election where both Democratic Senatorial candidate Bill Nelson and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum won this county with just over 50% of the vote, respectively, as a sign that the county is trending Democratic. As white middle and upper class families reportedly move to surrounding counties like St. Johns County -- the population of white residents in the county continues to shrink. Today 52% of the Duval County's population is white according to Census data. As minority communities and younger populations burgeon, Duval's political landscape is said to be reflecting such shift. \"I don't think you can have a candidate assume that because someone is a Democrat or assume that because they're a Republican, that you would or would not have an opportunity to win them over because people are voting across party lines a great deal within our community,\" contended Jones. \"So goes Florida, so goes the nation,\" said Byrd. \"And so goes Duval County, so goes Florida.\" Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg told \"CBS This Morning\"\u00a0that Vice President Pence is a \"very effective debater\" ahead of the vice presidential debate between Pence and California Senator Kamala Harris. \"I've seen him debating for governor and debating for vice president as well,\" Buttigieg, a former South Bend, Indiana mayor, said. \"He has an ability to deliver lines with a high degree of confidence whether they're true or not.\" CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Buttigieg, who advocated for Supreme Court reform during his presidential run, deflected when asked about if Harris could clarify the Democratic ticket's position on court packing. Buttigieg said the debate will focus on issues that are \"at stake right now.\" Buttigieg added, \"We've got less than 30 days until the election and a matter of weeks before the court may entertain a case that could decide whether pre-existing care - pre-existing condition coverage -- is taken away from millions of Americans as Republicans try to overthrow the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.\" In the\u00a0newest episode\u00a0of \"The Debrief with Major Garret,\"\u00a0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\u00a0explores polling and election night projections in interviews with top pollsters and decision desk editors including\u00a0CBS News Elections and Surveys Director Anthony Salvanto. The episode takes a look at why the 2016 election has given certain pollsters PTSD and how news organizations like the Associated Press decide how to call a race. \"I think the people expect polls to be 100% accurate, and they get very upset when they're not, you know, in polling, we are constantly doing our best to try to anticipate and understand people's sentiments and get as close as we can as of an accurate pulse on where voters are at a certain point,\" said Carly Cooperman, the CEO and partner of Schoen Cooperman research. More Than A Vote, a voting rights organization led by athletes including NBA superstar Lebron James, announced a partnership with the ride sharing service Lyft in Harris County, which is home to Houston. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports the partnership comes after Texas Governor Greg Abbott is prohibiting more than one mail-in ballot drop-off location per county. There are more than 2 million registered voters in Harris County. Under this partnership, Lyft will provide transportation up to $15 to the NRG Arena ballot drop-off site. Former NBA player and More Than A Vote member Kendrick Perkins, who resides in Harris County, said in a statement that the partnership will help provide some access to voters, but that voters in Harris County voters should have more options in the first place. \"No doubt Harris County voters should have greater access to ballot drop-off options, but given the current reality, we're going to help people vote in whatever way we can,\" Perkins said. The Senate GOP's campaign arm moved overnight to appeal a federal court's ruling extending Arizona's voter registration cutoff to October 23, after two groups in the battleground state -- Mi Familia Vota and the Arizona Coalition for Change --\u00a0won an eleventh-hour plea\u00a0to postpone the deadline over lagging voter registration figures. Republicans in the state quickly\u00a0denounced the decision, warning of \"substantial confusion and new burdens for voters and election officials.\" CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports news of ruling comes amid a flurry of legal battles in the state as\u00a0counties prepare to\u00a0mail out ballots this week. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0recently granted a request\u00a0to expedite an appeal of a ruling denying members of the Navajo Nation an extension to the state's ballot deadline. In Cochise County, the Arizona Center for Disability Law\u00a0asked a federal court\u00a0late Monday for a preliminary injunction to allow for curbside voting. And before the state's supreme court, election officials in Arizona's largest county late Monday\u00a0celebrated a decision\u00a0allowing for some voters to cast ballots through video. Following reports of voters experiencing technical difficulties with online voter registration in the hours before the state's initial registration deadline on October 5, Florida Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee issued a directive Tuesday that will extend the voter registration deadline until 7 p.m. on Tuesday, October 6. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Governor Ron DeSantis told reporters that issues began with the online voter registration site around 5 p.m. Monday evening that correlated with an unprecedented amount of traffic online with people registering in the last hours. In addition to announcing the deadline was extended until 7 p.m. Tuesday, DeSantis also said supervisor of elections offices throughout the state were to remain open until 7 p.m. Tuesday. Local departments of motor vehicles and tax collector offices throughout the state were also urged to remain open until 7 p.m. to allow people to register in-person today. Florida voter registration applications will also be accepted as long as they're postmarked by the new deadline, according to DeSantis. \"They're investigating some of the issues of kind of what led to it but it was an inordinate amount of traffic,\" said DeSantis during the press conference Tuesday. \"We really think it's important that there also be live people that can help and then it's not just internet or nothing because I mean, you can have the best site in the world, sometimes there's hiccups on it. And so this way, people even when they get off from work, they're going to have till 7:00 where they could be able to go do that.\" However top Democrat and Florida Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried said in a tweet Tuesday that the new deadline could still leave Floridians struggling to register. \"While Governor Ron DeSantis has extended the voter registration deadline, the new 7 p.m. deadline forces Floridians to scramble to register, and that's only if they see the news,\" said Fried in a\u00a0tweet. Fried was one of the first to call out problems with the online registration tool on Monday, flagging the website as \"broken\" and calling on DeSantis to \"fix it now\" in a\u00a0tweet. Since the extension was announced Tuesday afternoon, both the Democratic and Republican state parties and Joe Biden have called on informed voters of the extension. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill today to give clerks in some cities a head start on processing absentee ballots before Election Day, but officials are still urging people to be patient for results, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The law allows clerks in cities with at least 25,000 people to open absentee ballot envelopes and do some pre-processing work for 10 hours on the Monday before Election Day. Ballots cannot be counted until Election Day. Michigan normally does not allow clerks to get started processing absentee ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day, but there was a major push from Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and local clerks to extend that period due to the massive amount of absentee ballots that are expected to be cast in the election. While Benson said she's grateful for the change, she said it doesn't go as far as she would like and still believes it may take until Friday after the election to count all of Michigan's votes. \"This legislation today is a step in the right direction. It does not go far enough,\" Benson said. \"Importantly this does not change our statewide estimation as to when results will be announced this fall.\" Benson again projected record turnout in Michigan's general election. Already, more than 2.7 million Michigan voters have requested absentee ballots and more than 384,000 people have returned their ballots. At this point in 2016, there were just over 800,000 requests and nearly 78,000 people had returned ballots. The Trump campaign announced this week another stop on Vice President Pence's Western swing: he will rally supporters in Southern Nevada following his debate with Senator Kamala Harris in nearby Utah and ahead of a stop in neighboring Arizona. While past Trump campaign events in the state have drawn ire in recent months for violating the state's COVID-19 restrictions,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports Nevada's governor recently\u00a0relaxed gathering limits\u00a0to accommodate up to 250 people. Also in Nevada, the Culinary Union\u00a0says one of its members\u00a0\"acted inadvertently and without authorization\" when leaving a flyer in a mailbox, after a Trump campaign aide in the state raised alarm\u00a0over a photo\u00a0posted by the Los Angeles Times of a canvasser from the influential Nevada labor group \"going into people's mailboxes.\" First enacted during the Great Depression to curb people dodging postage costs,\u00a0Tin\u00a0says federal law restricts access to mailboxes to the postal service -- a rule the Culinary Union said it conveys in written instructions to their canvassers. Past violations have reportedly incurred warnings from federal authorities and bills for the missing postage. A federal court today denied the Trump campaign's injunction to stop New Jersey from counting ballots 10 days before Election Day and accepting ballots received two days after Election Day (without postmark limitation), reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. In a written statement U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp denied the campaign's motion to override the New Jersey law, explaining that federal law ought not override state legislation. \"The interpretation that the federal Election Day statutes preempt any state discretion on the timing of election-related activity cannot be reconciled with Congress's requirement that states permit absentee voting, but leaving the manner and timing of absentee voting to the discretion of each state,\" the judge wrote. Federal authorities\u00a0announced Tuesday\u00a0new details of their plan to devote more resources to the coming general election\u00a0at a press conference\u00a0with New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, current president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports federal officials say their effort, which will include an FBI command post and prosecutor assigned to focus on the coming election, is part of an unprecedented effort to address potential election threats and civil rights violations this year. Early voting started on Tuesday in Ohio, and there were long lines of voters outside county boards of elections offices in Columbus, Cincinnati and Cleveland, according to videos and photos circulating on social media. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that as of October 2, Ohio's county boards of elections have received 2,154,235 absentee ballot applications. At the same point in 2016, the county boards of elections received 1,091,188 absentee ballot applications. The Hamilton County Board of Elections said it sent 157,000 absentee ballots to voters who requested an absentee ballot, which surpassed the total number of absentee ballots cast -- in-person and by mail -- in the county in the 2016 general election, according to data from the secretary of state's office. A Hamilton County elections official told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0that as of 1 p.m., 1,857 people voted in person and 44 people cast a provisional ballot. Similarly, Franklin County has seen an influx of absentee ballot applications, compared to the 2016 general election. The Franklin County boards of elections mailed out more than 237,000 absentee ballots to voters ahead of early voting, according to Aaron Sellers, who is the public information officer for the Franklin County board of elections. To kick off early voting in the state, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign is starting to air ads in the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Dayton markets. The Biden campaign is also running radio ads in multiple metropolitan and rural markets across the state. A Philadelphia judge on Tuesday heard arguments over whether poll watchers are required to be allowed inside satellite election offices. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports the Trump campaign filed the lawsuit after Philadelphia elections officials refused to allow Trump campaign representatives to watch voters registering, filling out ballots and returning them at satellite elections offices last week. Philadelphia's commissioners and the secretary of the commonwealth, the top elections official in the state, have contended that such sites don't qualify as polling places, and that there isn't even a procedure to certify poll watchers for early voting at them. Linda Kerns, representing the Trump campaign, argued Tuesday before Judge Gary Glazer, that Philadelphia's elections officials advertised the locations as a place where you can \"vote\" and that they thus qualify as polling places. \"They decided to open these early voting centers, and when they did, they should have contemplated that candidates were going to watch, and they cannot be allowed to skirt,\" she said, adding that members of the media were allowed in the offices, but Trump campaign representatives weren't. Ben Field, a deputy city solicitor, argued that the election code only considers voting centers on election day to be polling places. \"There is nothing about the fact that ballots are being filled out, whether at a kitchen table in a post office in a hallway, or in an office the Board of Elections established that requires any sort of observation whatsoever,\" he argued. Now, the decision is up to Glazer, although both parties will have a right to appeal. \"I've got to think about it\" Glazer said. \"It's not an everyday question, but I will decide it in due course.\" In what has become a whirlwind of events regarding the witness signature requirement for South Carolina voters' absentee ballots,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the Supreme Court ordered late Monday evening that South Carolina voters do need a witness signature in order for their ballots to be counted in the upcoming general election. The order comes with less than a month ahead of the November 3 election. In a statement issued by the South Carolina Election Commission Tuesday, the commission reiterated that ballots received through Wednesday, October 7 will be accepted without a witness signature. \"South Carolinians voting absentee by mail must now have their signatures on ballot return envelopes witnessed after the United States Supreme Court late yesterday reinstated the requirement,\" said the SCEC in a\u00a0statement. \"Under the court's order, ballots already received by county officials and those received through October 7 will be counted regardless of whether the return envelope bears a witness signature.\" The commission added that in order for voters to ensure their absentee ballot counts, they should sign the voter's oath on the ballot return envelope, have a witness sign and provide address, and return their ballot before 7:00 p.m. on November 3. South Carolina State Representative J.A. Moore, whose mother is a lead plaintiff in the initial lawsuit to strike the witness requirement, said that despite the challenges the witness requirement may pose for voters, he's encouraged that this order will also motivate voters to exercise their right in November. \"What we've seen is that those that are in power, that don't want real changes to happen, it's a roadblock. I think, it is another way to suppress people's right as citizens to vote,\" said Moore. \"But...I've gotten so many calls over the past six hours of people that are even more emboldened to vote because they know their power, because there's been so many people trying to stop them from voting or create even more roadblocks during a global pandemic. So, I think in a lot of ways it has motivated people to vote early, to have an action plan on how they're going to vote safely.\" The Milwaukee Election Commission announced on Tuesday that the Fiserv Forum, home to the Bucks, and Miller Park, home to the Brewers, won't be used as early voting in-person absentee voting sites over concerns about potential legal challenges, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. \"Unfortunately, the addition of these two sites could be legally challenged due to a recent court ruling, and we don't want to do anything that could risk a City of Milwaukee voter's ballot being counted,\" Claire Woodall-Vogg, Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director, said in a statement. \"We want residents of Milwaukee to feel complete and unwavering confidence that their ballot will be counted in the election and this action reflects that commitment.\" Woodall-Vogg told the\u00a0Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u00a0that the decision stemmed from a federal judge's rejection of requests to expand early voting and\u00a0guidance\u00a0issued yesterday by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The WEC notice said the deadline to authorize additional voting sites was June 12 and the WEC has \"no ability to authorize\" clerks to designate additional in-person absentee voting sites. Milwaukee officials announced the two arenas as early voting sites in August. Last week, the chair of the Republican Party of Wisconsin sent a note to the Milwaukee Election Commission warning about potential \"electioneering\" issues at the sites if Bucks or Brewers players or mascots were around during early voting. Woodall-Vogg said there would still be a record 13 early in-person absentee voting sites in the city of Milwaukee. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers' administration also announced on Tuesday that it would limit public indoor gatherings, including bars and restaurants, to 25% capacity, reports\u00a0Brewster. The move comes as Wisconsin has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases that has pushed some hospitals to the brink. \"There is no other way to say it: we are overwhelmed,\" Evers said during a press conference on Tuesday. Evers' top attorney, Ryan Nilsestuen, said he expects legal challenges from conservative groups or Republicans, who have pushed back against Evers' COVID-19 orders since the spring. Legislative Republicans recently filed a brief supporting a conservative legal group's challenge to Evers' statewide mask order. In May, the Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down Evers' safer at home order following a challenge by legislative Republicans. Nilsestuen said he believes this new order could survive a legal challenge. Evers' order takes effect on Thursday morning. The Wisconsin Supreme Court said on Tuesday that Republicans in the legislature have standing to represent the state's interests in court, meaning they can continue to appeal a decision to extend Wisconsin's absentee ballot deadline. Brewster\u00a0reports that a federal judge recently ruled that Wisconsin must accept absentee ballots postmarked by November 3 that arrive by November 9. Ballots are normally due when polls close on Election Day. Republicans appealed that decision, but a panel of judges on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said that the legislature wasn't able to bring the challenge. The legislature asked the full slate of judges on the 7th Circuit to hear its appeal, and the court turned to the State Supreme Court for guidance. Because of the State Supreme Court's ruling, Republicans can continue to appeal the extended absentee ballot deadline. NORTH CAROLINA A spokesperson for Senator Thom Tillis' reelection campaign said in a statement Tuesday morning that every campaign staff member who was in close proximity to Senator Tillis last week has tested negative for COVID-19 as of Monday. Tillis tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday. The campaign will still keep its Charlotte campaign headquarters closed for the rest of the week out of an abundance of caution, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Tillis, in an interview on Fox News Tuesday morning, said he \"feels great.\" He also said he plans to attend the first day or two of next week's confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett virtually but may be able to attend the rest in person after he's cleared. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that though Tillis' campaign has been closed due to health precaution, the state's Republican Party has continued to call out Tillis' Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham in light of the news of his extramarital affair. The Republican Governor's Association said in\u00a0tweet\u00a0Tuesday that North Carolina Democratic governor Roy Cooper should be calling on Cunningham to \"come clean & tell voters the whole story before any more votes are cast.\" The NCGOP made a similar request in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0to North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin, who will be touring multiple counties in the state. \"Since Cal Cunningham refuses to answer questions about the most serious scandal to rock North Carolina politics since the John Edwards sex scandal,\" began the NCGOP in the tweet. \"Maybe the Chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party might while he's campaigning across the state.\" President Trump's decision to drop any further COVID-19 stimulus package negotiations until after the election adds to months of stalemate on Capitol Hill and could have ramifications for the House battlefield. For months, congressional leaders have been slammed over their failure to agree on another economic relief bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has put the onus on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not taking up the HEROES Act or increasing the funding, while Republicans have often painted the demands in the act as a \"liberal wish list.\" But Mr. Trump\u00a0put the blame solely on Pelosi Tuesday, tweeting that she's asking for \"$2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19\" and that he has \"instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.\" The budget for the relief package has been\u00a0debated before, with Republicans offering at least $1.1 trillion and Democrats setting $2.2 trillion as their floor. In a statement, Pelosi said Mr. Trump \"showed his true colors\" by walking away from the deal. \"Walking away from coronavirus talks demonstrates that President Trump is unwilling to crush the virus, as is required by the Heroes Act,\" she wrote. Earlier on Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell urged Congress to pass an aid deal, saying that \"the recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.\" Two Democrat Representatives from Pennsylvania, Chrissy Houlahan and Matt Cartwright, told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0before Mr. Trump's Tweets they were hopeful about passing a deal. Houlahan, a freshman Democrat who flipped her West Philadelphia suburban seat in 2018, said she was on a call with Pelosi and the Pennsylvania delegation Monday night and that passing a deal was said to be a main priority. Congressman John Katko of New York is a member, along with Houlahan, of the House's Problem Solver's Caucus. He is also one of two incumbent Republicans seeking re-election to a district Clinton won in 2016. In a\u00a0Tweet\u00a0Tuesday, he said he disagrees with the president's approach. \"With lives at stake, we cannot afford to stop negotiations on a relief package...I strongly urge the President to rethink this move,\" he wrote. A\u00a0Hill-HarrisX poll\u00a0from September 30 to October 1 found that respondents would prefer the Senate pass a COVID-19 relief bill first, rather than confirming Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Dr. Jean W. Harris, a political science professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania, told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0the lack of a deal could have \"big impacts\" on the Northeast portion of the state, an important area to Trump's 2016 win. \"I think the economic ramifications of that decision to stop talking to that 'radical Pelosi' -- people will recognize that as a concern,\" she said, adding that it may mobilize more Democratic voters. Weeks after testing positive for COVID-19, Missouri Governor Mike Parson's office issued a statement Monday afternoon saying he and First Last Teresa Parson have \"fully recovered and returned to their regular schedules.\" Their statement also revealed that four of the governor's staffers have tested positive \"since the beginning of Missouri's fight with COVID-19\" and have also fully recovered. Parson is not planning to be retested and that anyone \"meeting the definition of close contact\" tested negative, the statement said. He is facing one of the more competitive gubernatorial re-elections in 2020 against Democrat Nicole Galloway. Parson's campaign did say he would be attending in-person campaign events soon, and campaign manager Steele Shippy told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0the governor \"has always and will continue to follow the recommended health and safety protocols and looks forward to the final weeks of the campaign.\" Throughout the pandemic, Parson has not issued a statewide mask mandate, leaving that decision to local officials, and he has also\u00a0been seen\u00a0at campaign events without a mask. Galloway, currently Missouri's state auditor, has said she would issue a statewide mask mandate if elected and has been criticizing Parson on his pandemic response all summer. More recently she's\u00a0pointed\u00a0to a report by the\u00a0St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u00a0about at least 1,800 state employees testing positive. The two have their first debate this Friday.",

SUE GORDON: Me, too. MICHAEL MORELL: We started the same year at CIA. We grew up together. We took classes together, training classes together. She was always better in the training class than I was. We played basketball together. When we first played basketball, I had no idea that she was a college basketball player. And she is a bad-ass basketball player, let me tell you. But I've worked with her for a long time. I think the world of her. When she was named the number two in the National Security, in the IC, I could not have been prouder. And it's a great opportunity to be up here with you. SUE GORDON: Thanks. MICHAEL MORELL: So let's start by talking about the importance of intelligence. So we both started our career during the Cold War. SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Intelligence had a certain importance. And we had a decade where we weren't quite sure what was happening. And then 9/11 happens and-- SUE GORDON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: --there was a significance to that. And now we're in a different world-- SUE GORDON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM) MICHAEL MORELL: --right? There's great power conflict, rapid changes in technology. Talk about how important intelligence is today in specific terms, but also relative to history. SUE GORDON: Yes. Well, so thanks, General Hayden. Anytime I get to sit in a center that has your name and sit in front of you is a good day for me. And Tom, thank you so much for having me here at the Schar School. And Mike, you know. You know. Two bins for historical context. So I think we're in what I'm going to call the third epic in threat environments. The first one is the Cold War, where the threat actors were nation-states. Soviet Union was the one that dominated. I know when Michael and I started, I was in an office of 780 people. Seven hundred and seventy-nine of them did the Soviet Union and one guy did China and he also did the rest of the world. There were nation-states. Governments held the information. We built intelligence systems to go get the information that governments held, and specific collection systems. And our consumers were pretty much policymakers and war-fighters, disproportionately. And our analysis was also disproportionately political and military. First one. The Berlin Wall falls down. Kind of wandering around that wilderness. But we were still applying Cold War collection systems to a proliferating world. We still were going after the information that governments held. We were still going after it with the same thing. The problem was, we just didn't have the installed base. So we were applying the same methodology. We were the same people trying to produce the same analysis, but we didn't have the same foundation. And so that's why you see those years after the fall of the Berlin Wall until 1999, we're still organized much the same as we were in the Cold War. We're now trying to apply those same theories about a very distributed world. And I think we could talk about the successes and failures. 9/11 happens. Now non nation-state individuals hold the information. Our consumers are, yes, policymakers and war-fighters, but they are allies, non-allies and state and local. So not only do you have to go get the information in a different place than it was, was held by individuals, and so you see the rise of cyber. Because it's their communications that you're trying to find the information. And you're trying to learn how to formalize this differently than the traditional means. Now we're in a third epic of ubiquitous technology, digital connected and data abundance, where the world knows everything. We're not having to hunt for information anymore. And so all the threats are to and through information, and so we're in a third change. But we're still dragging the Cold War organizational construct and the 9/11 construct, and we're trying to figure out how to fit this new world. So, world change, that's the historical context. One thing that has been constant is that intelligence is about colloquially knowing the truth, seeing beyond the horizon and allowing the leaders to act before events dictate. You agree that's-- MICHAEL MORELL: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). SUE GORDON: That's what we've also done. That's what we're doing today. And I think you could imagine that that is a necessary craft all the way into the future. You can't imagine a future where that craft wouldn't be valuable. Do you agree? And intelligence isn't just about knowing more information. It is about having a trade craft around being able to deal with fundamentally uncertain information with certainty. It is never opinion. It is always craft how you see and observe events and inductively draw a generalization, rather than having a theory and trying to prove it. And there's nothing different about today from when we started or at any point in the future, except what? The environment in which you're trying to do that, and who has the information, and how you go after it, and pesky privacy laws and pesky digital connectedness, and what is truth today, and what the hell is the horizon that you're trying to see beyond, and who are the leaders that are making the decisions that you're trying to inform. And if I look at it today, all of those things have changed, to include the leaders. Would we all agree that CEOs of companies are making decisions that are affecting global security? Should intelligence inform them? Right? So I think that's the most interesting thing to me in a world that has just exploded in terms of connectedness, in a world where the answers are known by kind of the ethos. You still want that clarity, but how do you go get it when most of your rules were designed physically? MICHAEL MORELL: So the world has changed. SUE GORDON: Yes. World's changed. MICHAEL MORELL: And the intelligence community, like every other-- SUE GORDON: Same mission. MICHAEL MORELL: --right? SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Is a little slow to adapt. SUE GORDON: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: So, what do you-- SUE GORDON: But still necessary. MICHAEL MORELL: --what do you think are the fundamental changes that we need to make as a community so that we are effective in the future? SUE GORDON: Three things. I'm going to prove I can give a short answer. One, we're going to have to figure out how to use unclassified information. So our history is collecting information as we decide to collect it, so it had a \"have to have.\" And we had confidence in the data because we were essentially curating it. Now we need to use open data, but we need to be able to use it with confidence. And one, you've got to use open data. And you've got to be able to use open data not as a \"nice to have,\" but integrated with all the others. The second thing is we've got to get better at doing economic analysis. Because a digitally-connected world is fundamentally an economically-driven world. And you can see it in so many things happening today, where alliances are being tested by economic realities. \"Yes, I want to be partners with the United States, but China's offering me a deep-water port.\" And we have a president that sees the world more economically than just geopolitically. And there are good reasons why the intelligence community is not as steeped in those things, in others, \"Where's the information held,\" and whether we believe we can go after it. So, that's two. We've got to get more economic. And the third thing is, I believe we're going to have to write unclassified products. MICHAEL MORELL: Because the customer base is changing. SUE GORDON: Because the customer base is changing. So my challenge is, is our business isn't secrecy. Our business is national security. And if the people who are affecting national security are either the populace-- they're being influenced-- or the private sector, they're making decisions that affect security. How do we, the national security apparatus, give information to the decision-- and that is a big change. Right? That's not a casual change. That isn't giving our products to something else, because they're very different crafts. And so you can't be casual around it. So those are the three changes I think we're going to have to effect. MICHAEL MORELL: And you pushed these things when you were-- SUE GORDON: I did. MICHAEL MORELL: --the deputy. And how far did you get, do you think? SUE GORDON: Boy-- MICHAEL MORELL: And did-- SUE GORDON: --using unclassified information, I think we got a long way there, but the systems just aren't in place for it to be able to be considered in the stream of analysis. And there's so much of it, that concurrently you're going to have to have some data analytics and processing. If you want to go with AI, you can. But you're going to have to do it. And that is hard culturally because of the inherent uncertainty in making analytic judgments. Will you allow a (UNINTEL)? Just so you understand intelligence analysis from an intelligence analyst. Raise your hand if you like doing jigsaw puzzles. Awesome. Keep them up. Do you like doing jigsaw puzzles if you don't know the picture? Keep them up. Do you like doing jigsaw puzzles if you don't know the picture and you know you only have a quarter of the pieces? Do you like doing jigsaw puzzles if you don't know the picture, you only have a quarter of the pieces and the president wants to know what the picture is in five minutes because he needs to make a consequential decision? MICHAEL MORELL: So for the people in my class, I did not pay her to say this. SUE GORDON: Right. And so intelligence is about, \"How do I construct something around that so that whatever quarter of the pieces I have, I can allow them to be considered legitimately.\" And so in a world where the world has all this information, I want more to be considered legitimately, well, you're going to have to use machines to do it. But that is hard when analysts will tell you, \"Well, I just know.\" Right? Or, just history, right? And so the big conundrum on our special intelligence is this notion that, \"That's okay. Humans are always going to be in the loop.\" No. They're not. They can't. Because if they have to be in the loop, they're not going to be able to see all the things that we're going to do. So, yes, include unclassified information. And then put that into the stream, that's a hard one to do. So, some there. (OVERTALK) SUE GORDON: Economic, I think we're making good progress on economic. I think we are. I think this president has forced that. I think using economic pressure and trying to provide this president with the kind of intelligence, if he wanted to make the kind of decisions he wanted to do, has really advanced our craft in that. And on the producing unclassified, I think there's some really good noble examples where we've seen the benefit, the 2016 ICA, which was unclassified. That was telling the people who were affected here, American citizens, \"You're being influenced.\" Giving the power to someone else is a notable example. But that's still hard for us-- MICHAEL MORELL: I also think there's a notable example. Go to the National and Geospatial Intelligence Agency's-- SUE GORDON: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: --website, and you will see all sorts of unclassified analysis-- SUE GORDON: Yes, it's unbelievable. MICHAEL MORELL: --out there. It's really cool. And that will actually allow you to do some of the analysis. SUE GORDON: It will. Just over the past five years-- and I give credit to my previous boss-- is this notion of (UNINTEL) open. And that is that this is a perfect example of government, is seeing that the government cannot collect it at great expense, could be used openly in areas like disaster relief and understanding the Alaskan tundra and so many things, where taking this historical set of data and making it available for scientists to use is really remarkable. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, so with this large number of national security issues out there-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --what can't we get wrong? What do we absolutely have to get right going forward from a national security perspective, the intelligence community? SUE GORDON: I'll go from a national perspective. We need two things going forward. We're going to have to figure out how we trust our communications and how we're able to ascertain what's true. Right? And so if then, the intelligence community is disproportionately expected to be able to operate those, we're going to have to be drivers of those, too. But the world has figured out how to use the digital environment in order to advance whether our adversaries or our competitors' interests, they've figure out how to advance their interests in the relatively ungoverned, massively instantaneously zero-cost world of data and data manipulation. And-- (OVERTALK) MICHAEL MORELL: --so things are linked, right? SUE GORDON: Right. They are. So, what we must get right is trust in truth. What intelligence community needs to do is be on the driving side of how you ascertain that, without longing for a simpler time and only looking in the historic places for information, because the information is being held in many other places than where we historically look. And you still need intent. MICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, you were-- I'm switching gears here a little bit-- you were the number two in the intelligence community during a very unique time, the presidency-- SUE GORDON: Surprising time. MICHAEL MORELL: --of Donald Trump. SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Right? And I want to ask you some questions that flow from that. So you were asked by the president to be the number two. SUE GORDON: Yes. I was his-- MICHAEL MORELL: And-- SUE GORDON: --appointee. MICHAEL MORELL: You were his appointee. And you knew a lot about him going into that. SUE GORDON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: There were the never-Trumpers. There were the things he said about the intelligence community during the transition. There's a lot of stuff going on. Did you have to think about saying yes, or was it, \"I'm a soldier, I'm going to salute and serve my country\"? Talk to us about that. SUE GORDON: Yes, I don't think I had any hesitance at all. Right? I used to talk to a class and say, \"If you took all the Cabinet officials standing around in an open field, Hunger Games-style, with all the departments and missions in the middle, everyone would race for intelligence.\" Right? Because there's a purity in intelligence. All you have to do is pursue the truth as hard as you can. All you have to do is present it as clearly as you can, so that good decisions can be made. And because you serve the Constitution, as hired by the president, my love of country covers you, you're going to work tirelessly to try and provide information to the president, regardless of who it is-- in my case, I think seven. I don't know how many you served, but I served seven presidents. So that's a no-brainer, right? Career intelligence officer. The number two is the career intelligence officer. The number one, the DNI is typically-- Jim Clapper was an anomaly-- oftentimes a political appointee. Easy call, right? Because you're trying to give the best information for the best decisions. MICHAEL MORELL: Second question is-- (OVERTALK) MICHAEL MORELL: --Dan Coats, who was the DNI-- SUE GORDON: And by the way, I would say that anytime for most people your president asks you to do something, I think it's a pretty, pretty brazen person who says, \"Yeah, I'd say no.\" Right? I think that's hard. But in intelligence, it was easy. MICHAEL MORELL: Dan Coats, DNI-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --number of times, walking in-- you said it was four-- but a number of times he spoke up publicly-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --and spoke truth to power. SUE GORDON: He did. MICHAEL MORELL: Did his job. SUE GORDON: Absolutely. MICHAEL MORELL: Is that something that he had to consciously think about, \"This is a moment where I need to speak out\"? Or was it happenstance? SUE GORDON: No, I think one of the things that Dan did, one of Dan's tremendous qualities who answered his nation call several times. And one of the things I think Dan did really well is he understood the ethos of the intelligence community. He embraced what we were, which is kind of relentlessly responsible. He said it, \"Seek the truth. Speak the truth.\" And I think he carried that mantra. And so I think he did it well. I think he didn't try and cross into policy. I think that allowed him to say it. And the three or four times that he spoke publicly-- many more times than that in policy settings-- but three or four times publicly was when a statement was made that had one or two characteristics. One is impugning the integrity of the intelligence community. You just can't stand for that. We could be wrong until the cows come home, but not wrong-motivated, wrong-headed. And then the second is misstating what we need to be true. Right? So you see the Putin examples and you see the things around election security. Those two things typically, I really do think it was only a handful of times that he made a public statement where he just needed to clarify what the intelligence or what the intelligence community said. And he did it pretty non-pejoratively. He just came out and corrected the record. And I think what that did was two things. I think we have kept the intelligence, and I think the current leaders have kept the intelligence community, by and large, with their eyes in the boat. And the second is, just established that there are certain conversations that we aren't going to-- you aren't going to be able to say about the intelligence community. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. And then the third question is your own experience those last couple of weeks-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --right? And having gone through Benghazi, I know as well as anybody that it's not fun to be in the public domain with people saying things about you that aren't true, taken out of context. SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: And I'm just wondering how that was for you, number one. And number two, what did you learn from that? SUE GORDON: So just in case you all don't spend your whole life looking at the career of Susan M. Gordon-- I don't know why; you might do something other than that-- but the day came in the summer where Dan Coats was no longer going to be the DNI. Statutes said that the principal deputy would become the acting DNI. And that was the path we were on. And then in a tweet on the day that Dan's resignation was announced, it became clear that there was some question about whether I would be acting DNI. Over the course of two weeks, it became clear that I wasn't going to be acting DNI. And so we had a problem. Because statute said I must be. And the president clearly no longer preferred that I step into that role. Two things; personal -- One, if you are the third child of a Naval officer and the man that appointed you decides that he doesn't want you to continue, one of the things you do is a cheery, \"Aye aye,\" and you give room for something to happen. The second for me, it was, I didn't want to be another source of rub between the president and the intelligence community. Right? It was a tough enough relationship that, imagine this, I'm going to fight it out, saying, \"No, no, no, no. You must have her.\" Well, that would become another thing. And what was most important was that the president got intelligence. So on a personal level, that was a relatively easy call for that reason. On the other half of the personal level, notwithstanding those discussions privately, I then became-- and that event became-- a hammer for other-- I mean, a nail for other people's hammers, where that event, depending on which side of the political spectrum you came on, I was either evil incarnate deep-state who clearly must be gotten rid of, or right-- MICHAEL MORELL: A great intelligence-- SUE GORDON: --oh, a-- MICHAEL MORELL: --professional. SUE GORDON: -- a great intelligence professional who had stood up and given truth to power. And the problem was, I didn't want to be anyone's agenda. And so for me, the most difficult time was to somehow keep my own bearing, be true to what I think the craft of intelligence is, which is to keep intelligence in the president's relationship and allow that to happen, while allowing people who have no idea who I am to say things about me that were completely ridiculous. And so there's some really interesting moments when you try and-- when you're in extremis and you try and figure out who you are. And I would just tell you that when you find yourself in that circumstance, you've got to just navigate it for yourself. Because a lot of people will tell you what to do. You just have to do it. So to me, it was, one, I knew how to handle the moment even though there's still an uncertainty that I have of why that was in anyone's best interest. The other piece was, then I became news and used for whatever side of the argument you wanted to be on. And for an intelligence officer that pretty much spends their life being a humble tenbender (PH), that was odd. It was odd. It was odd personally. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. So when you gave the president your resignation letter-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --you also gave him a personal note. SUE GORDON: I did. MICHAEL MORELL: I'm not asking you what it said, but why-- SUE GORDON: That's okay. MICHAEL MORELL: --did you do that? SUE GORDON: Well, they released it. So. The White House released the note. Yeah, so this is so great. One, I will just tell you all, anything you write, anything you said, is written and said. So, just be careful about what you put down. So my resignation letter, I wrote because I had three messages I wanted to send. Number one is, I was honored to serve. You know what? When I did my confirmation hearing, my opening line was, \"I love America. I love being part of the process that our founders envisioned.\" And I was honored to serve the president of the United States and lead the intelligence community. So I wanted to send that message. The second was, I wanted to say, \"I am letting you have your team.\" Because that's, to me, what it felt like for some reason. He had decided he wanted a different team. But the real message in that resignation letter was for the intelligence community that said, \"Don't worry.\" Because if you think of it, Dan's a political appointee. These guys come and go. My worry was the intelligence community would see a careerist go and think, \"Oh my god, did we not get the memo?\" And what I wanted to do in that note was to say, \"Don't worry,\" One, \"Mr. President, the intelligence community's still gotcha.\" And the other was for the intelligence to say, is, \"Don't worry. You're all you need to be. You didn't need me to be here in order to do it.\" So that was that. The handwritten note? It was so funny. I had decided it was time that I needed to deliver that letter. I was down in my car to go down to the White House. And I remember thinking, \"Oh my god, what if I can't get in to see the president? That would be rude if I just dropped off a typed letter. I should dash off a handwritten note, just to not be rude.\" My parents raised me up right. \"Don't be rude.\" And so in fact I didn't get in. And so the note to the president was just really intended to say, \"You don't have to do this.\" Right? \"If you decide that for some reason you don't want to -- I'm not resigning because I'm trying to get away. I'm giving you room and being respectful. If that's not what you want, don't do this.\" So these two iconic things were actually notes to both communicate to the president and as much to communicate hope and confidence to the intelligence community, because I didn't want them to think that just because I was moving on, that the relationship was broken. MICHAEL MORELL: How do you think the intelligence community is doing standing up to the political pressure? SUE GORDON: I think it's hard. I think on the one hand, you can't judge anything by not seeing the intelligence community in the press. Because the intelligence community does its job not in the press. Right? I've got no data that there aren't the exact same assessments being made, briefings being given, involvement of the policy apparatus being (UNINTEL). So on the one hand, I don't think you can overjudge because you don't see the same to-ing and fro-ing. I think one of the great things about the DNI's position, and especially the DNI carried out by Jim Clapper and Dan Coats, it was trying to be that over-watch, so that it took the heat, so the intelligence community could do the work. And so I don't think it's surprising that you don't see Gina out there being really vocal, because that isn't where it is. But I do think that what we've learned over time is, national security issues spill out into the public. They affect the public. I can't think of a time that the leadership hasn't spoken up, but I think they're going to have to be ready to speak up, because every once in a while you have to correct the record. You always have. And I suspect you always will. MICHAEL MORELL: So I'm wondering-- SUE GORDON: I think it's harder. It's so much more partisan. Again, I say this all the time, it's not as different serving the president, because every president is the same because they're different, and every president wishes intelligence could say things that it can't, and every president is vexed by intelligence because we steal their decision space, but the environment in which that is playing out, both administration that feels under siege and hyper-partisanship on both sides, every action that the intelligence community thinks is just data, actually turns into agenda. And I don't think you can wish that away. I think you have to be ready to also make sure that you're clear about what you're saying. MICHAEL MORELL: And let me just ask you to put two recent data points-- SUE GORDON: Sure. MICHAEL MORELL: --into that context. One is, the reluctance, the apparent reluctance of the intelligence community to do an open hearing for the worldwide threat testimony. SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Right? That's one. And the other is, the DNI and the director of CIA standing at the State of the Union and cheering during what were absolutely clearly political moments. SUE GORDON: So let's see-- MICHAEL MORELL: Do those two things trouble you? SUE GORDON: So what was the first one? Oh-- MICHAEL MORELL: Worldwide Threat Testimony. SUE GORDON: No. I think the intelligence community hated open hearings, just in general. Always has. Because it's such a bad forum to be able to naturally articulate threat. Because the real grit and the foundation for much of its assessment lies in classified information. And so it's an awkward forum to be compelling and complete, particularly when the environment, one, is of challenging those conclusions, right? It's a difficult setting, because you can state things openly but when you're challenged it is hard to defend openly. And so it's just a tough thing. So, the intelligence community not wanting open hearings-- and again, I haven't been involved with the conversation -- but that doesn't surprise me. Because it's just a really tough one. And especially as partisan politics kicks up, the disadvantage and the chance for misspeak or the chance for misunderstanding just increases exponentially. So I wouldn't put too much on that, although I would say-- back to where I started-- I do believe that the American people are involved in national security and you have to be able to have a conversation with the American people in 2020 and beyond. And so however that's going to happen, I think intelligence is going to have to figure out how to do that well, whether that's open hearings or not. On the State of the Union-- so just remember, it has not always been thus, that intelligence officers have also been Cabinet members, right? Not in every administration that's true. And so-- MICHAEL MORELL: Bill Clinton it was. George Bush it wasn't. SUE GORDON: It wasn't. MICHAEL MORELL: Obama-- SUE GORDON: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: --it wasn't. SUE GORDON: Right. And so I would say that of Cabinet officials and of people trained in speaking publicly about their craft, the intelligence officers are still babes in the woods. Right? I will call us rubes in that regard, where we're just-- it's just not-- (OVERTALK) SUE GORDON: --you know, if you're an Air Force officer, you are trained. If you're in the military, you are trained in terms of being able to have open conversations about your stuff. That is just not where we've been. And so I think you still see us growing as intelligence officers, learning how to behave as part of the policy and political community. So, if that was a misstep in terms of standing up and not-- I put it more in the category of being caught in a situation that's, like, \"Oooh, I don't know how to play this. Do I stand up for the Tuskegee Airman? Do I not?\" And so, having had no conversations about it and my want is to always find the least sinister conclusion, I would just say it's just another example of growth of intelligence into the public arena and having to navigate, openly, the world of policy, which historically you were able to put your stuff out there and then back gently away. MICHAEL MORELL: And then one more question about this environment. And you and I have talked about this. SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Which is-- SUE GORDON: We've talked about almost everything-- (OVERTALK) MICHAEL MORELL: --which is, a lot of formers, including two right here-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --right, writing, speaking-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --thinking we're helping you, right-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --the DNI and the intelligence community-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --how did you see that? Was it helpful? Or wasn't? You can be honest. We've talked about this before. SUE GORDON: So one, private citizens get to say what they want to say. So, period. Two, we in the intelligence community have long benefitted from surrogates explaining intelligence, which is a kind of particular thing, to the American people. MICHAEL MORELL: We were talking about the Snowden example-- (OVERTALK) SUE GORDON: Yes, the Snowden example's a great example where when Snowden happened and the press was just merciless basically, making it seem like he was the hero exposing massive misuse of the Constitution, which, nothing further from the truth, the intelligence community didn't know how to speak about it. So we-- like Benghazi-- thought the answer was, \"Don't give fire oxygen. Just say nothing.\" And so what that meant was, only one point of view was going out there. And so Mike Hayden jumped in. And if you go back in time, he basically showed our way out of that, refuted some of the most hyperbolic statements that over extrapolated-- were doing and brought it back to reality. And so we have long benefited from-- particularly as more intelligence issues became open-- benefited from it. That said, in this environment that is hyper-political, that same intention to both protect our community-- right, because it was hurtful, some of the things that were being said, and we weren't fending off every challenge, you were trying to both protect the women and men in the intelligence community and talk about realities of geopolitics as you saw it-- but in this hyper-political environment, one of the effects that I saw was that it exacerbated a belief that the intelligence community was political and had a political view. And so what weirdly happened is it imputed, not to you but imputed to us, that we were all partisan, that if these recent leaders had a view, that it must be that that was a pervasive view of the intelligence community, which we would all tell you, we all have views but they don't affect the work we do. And the second thing it did was it took away people we could turn to have a voice when we needed a voice. MICHAEL MORELL: Fascinating. SUE GORDON: And three, I think it's part of the reason why I don't have a job, is because I had worked with all these men, supported them. And so that must mean that I am what they are. So, I don't know how that nets out, but I do think that that's-- I don't think you could do anything about it. But the one thing I would say to my former colleagues is, \"Thank you for defending our integrity. And you didn't have to worry about our ability to do our job. We knew how to do our job.\" MICHAEL MORELL: One more question before we go to questions from the audience. And that is, you have a lot of students here who are thinking about careers in intelligence. SUE GORDON: Yes, yes, you-- MICHAEL MORELL: What-- SUE GORDON: --should do it. MICHAEL MORELL: --what advice would you give them? SUE GORDON: One, you should do it. No, seriously. I was asked in another forum, because I think there's just this kind of pervasive, \"Oh my god, it's all such a mess, what are we going to do?\" You're the people that are going to find our way forward. Being able to see with clarity what's happening and then figure out how to present that in a way that's useful, it is more necessary now than ever and more elusive now than ever. There is less installed base. There is more to be figured out. There are more pieces of data that can help you. And there are more domains in which national security is going-- that it's going to be affected, that if you want to have impact going forward, this is exactly the right time to go into it. I think this is an incredibly exciting time if you're as optimistic a human as I am, and to step into this craft because it's so necessary and so elusive. Don't we all want to be pioneers at some level? It's no fun if all the answers are already known. This is a time where very few answers are known. You could be it. So-- MICHAEL MORELL: That's great. SUE GORDON: --leap into the fray. The second one is, this is a technical world. In 2020 and beyond, everyone must be technically competent. This digital environment demands that you understand how technology works. I'm not saying everyone has to be a technologist, but you must not leave that to somebody else. That has to be part of economics and politics and government and international law. Just looking alone at data rights and privacy, if you don't understand how it is technically instantiated, I don't know how you're going to understand the way through it from a legal or policy construct. And yet, we must, because privacy has to be protected but we have to be able to communicate. And so both those things. One, do it, because we need it and it's interesting as all get out. And two, make sure you are not technically adverse. And if you are a technologist in this room, for goodness sake, get yourself into social sciences classes, because things-- the same national and international interests are being affected technically. So it's just not what the technology could do, but how it is going to be used that's going to make a difference. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, so we've got two microphones. So, we'll go back and forth between the microphones. (AUDIENCE QUEWTIONS) MICHAEL MORELL: So I get to ask one more question. SUE GORDON: Yes, sir? MICHAEL MORELL: Which is-- SUE GORDON: Quick! MICHAEL MORELL: --which is, when I wake up in the morning-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --the world looks pretty bleak to me. SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: The world and our own politics here. But you are so optimistic-- SUE GORDON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: --whenever I talk to you. Why? SUE GORDON: I think it is because as I see the world, we're focusing on a conversation about this moment, about whether this moment is good or bad, whether this country is well-read or not, whether these decisions are well-grounded or not, and with institutions that are looking at some of those things, saying, \"You're doing it wrong.\" And while I think those are both interesting issues, what I think is much more interesting is this world is changing in a way that we can't long for a simpler time. And that it's a world that just needs to be solved just like it has been solved so many times before, just like it was solved in 1947 and just like it was solved in 2001, that there's a piece of me that instead of being focused on this-- and I agree, this is daunting, I'm a casualty of this-- but what I see in the middle of that is a really changed world with different forces acting on it, where our system is much better positioned to both find a structure that works because we're open and competitive, because we have discourse and we have the ability to have universities where we have different views of how to do it, that if that's all we have to solve, well we've solved that over and over again. And this doesn't seem so daunting to me, because that is something that we have seen before, even if, with all my hubris of all my years, I can say it's different than I've ever seen. But we have seen different before, so I tend to be optimistic about solving that. MICHAEL MORELL: So I hope you've all got a glimpse into why I so loved working with this person for as long as I did. Sue, thank you very much. SUE GORDON: Thanks, Michael. Thank you all. Come to work! Do it! What you're doing is good. What you're doing is good. Thank you so much. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "As Postmaster General Louis DeJoy\u00a0prepares to testify\u00a0before Congress on Friday and Monday, the former vice chairman of the U.S. Postal Service's Board of Governors and inspector general, David C. Williams, testified before the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Thursday afternoon at an ad hoc hearing. Williams, a Democrat, resigned from the USPS in April, shortly before DeJoy accepted President Trump's nomination.\u00a0CBS news campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says Williams' testimony plainly stated that the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were clearly interested in slowing down the Postal Service and making mail more expensive for Americans to use. Williams, who worked as USPS IG from 2003-2016, said he had \"never seen\" anything like Mnuchin's interest in the USPS. Williams also said Postmaster General DeJoy was guided through his interview process by fellow Board Governor John M. Barger. At the time, Williams said, he did not think DeJoy was a serious candidate given how uninformed he appeared. In his opening statement, Williams said, \"I resigned from the Board of Governors, because I was convinced that its independent role had been marginalized and that representations regarding an independent postal service for the nation were no longer truthful. I felt that the public was owed the truth in this matter.\" The USPS and DeJoy, a Republican donor, have recently come under fire for operational changes that led to delayed mail delivery - even though they announced they would be\u00a0holding off on the modifications\u00a0until after the election - which raised concerns about ballots being mailed in time to voters. The latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0shows that most Americans say that the USPS should be getting more funding to handle mail-in voting this year. And amidst reports of recent slow-downs in service due to the measures, nearly half of Americans say they rely a lot on mail and deliveries from the U.S. Postal Service in their daily lives. Majorities across demographic groups feel this way, though there are partisan differences. Nearly all Democrats and most independents think more funding should be allocated, but few Republicans agree. Most Republicans think the U.S. Postal Service should get the same amount of funding it has always gotten. Given past voting history, this partisan split may not be surprising. Our most recent poll shows that 26% of Democratic registered voters say have usually voted by mail in the past, compared to 15% of Republican voters. Looking ahead to his year, 37% of registered voters say they would prefer to vote by mail for the presidential election. Of those who would prefer to vote this way, 78% plan on voting for Joe Biden. Read more on this from the\u00a0CBS News Election & Survey Unit\u00a0here. NBA player Steph Curry and his family are set to endorse Joe Biden Thursday evening at the Democratic National Convention, CBS News has learned. Biden has been rehearsing his acceptance speech throughout the week and was still \"reviewing\" the address on Thursday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports from sources within the campaign. His family will introduce him, led by his children Hunter and Ashley Biden. The former VP's campaign advisers say the candidate will deliver a speech framed around his day one campaign message of the \"battle for the soul of America.\" The speech's main focus will not solely be on refuting President Trump, but Biden is expected to speak to what he sees as faults in Mr. Trump's leadership, similar to what he has said throughout his 483-day campaign. Biden will also call upon more specifics of his \"Build Back Better\" plans to boost American manufacturing, spark a \"green energy\" economy and kick start his \"21st century caregiving\" agenda if he wins in order to combat the ongoing economic crisis. Biden will also speak to the racial justice crisis as he sees this moment as evidence for the fight for the country's soul. Thursday's speech will be at least the seventh address Biden has given to a Democratic convention since he began attending 48 years ago in 1972. As Biden prepares to formally accept the nomination of his party on Thursday, Mr. Trump took his multi-state bid to upstage the Democratic National Convention to Biden's Pennsylvania hometown, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"Joe Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania,\" the president declared Thursday afternoon at a rally near the former vice president's birthplace in Scranton. \"He's actually, for the reasons we just said, he's your worst nightmare. Biden supported every single globalist attack on Pennsylvania workers.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the president criticized President Obama at length following his Democratic address. \"I watched President Obama last night, and I watched him talking about everything and I had to put it out. I said, 'yeah but he spied on our campaign and he got caught.'\" The president added, \"if that happened to another campaign on the other side, they would have had 25 people in jail for many years already.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed over the years, without evidence, that his predecessor \"spied\" on his campaign, a false allegation that the Obama White House tapped his Trump Tower phone lines prior to the 2016 general election. The president also mentioned his 2016 Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \"You look at Hillary, she was a lot smarter than Joe. But I'll tell you there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago,\" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump added that he watched \"another beauty,\" Kamala Harris last night - mispronouncing her name three times. \"I'll take Mike,\" the president grinned. As in other battleground states across the country, the president for months has at best virtually tied Biden in a state he won in 2016. But Mr. Trump insisted he remained hopeful of his chances in Pennsylvania, even as he again raised the specter of a \"rigged\" election, predicting \"based on the crowd outside, it looks to me like we're going to win this thing. I think, by the way, by a lot.\" The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits increased last week, raising some concerns about the economic recovery five months into the coronavirus pandemic, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.About 1.1 million Americans filed for traditional benefits last week, an increase of 135,000 from the previous week, bringing the total back above 1 million. More than 540,000 workers filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program for self-employed and gig workers. This marked the 22nd straight week where more people filed for unemployment benefits than the highest number of any week during the Great Recession. As of the week ending August 1, 28 million Americans were claiming some form of unemployment benefits. That was when the extra $600 in federal unemployment assistance expired. The Trump administration is offering an extra $300 in federal jobless benefits that states need to apply for. The NAACP is taking the U.S. Postal Service to court. The civil rights organization on Thursday filed a federal lawsuit against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. The lawsuit seeks to suspend new restrictions on mail carrier routes and other changes recently implemented by DeJoy. The group says the \"operational pivot\" has led to mail delays in some communities and accuses DeJoy of \"weaponizing\" the Postal Service to disenfranchise voters of color, reports\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. \"This willful and blatant attempt to obstruct the mail system amid a pandemic and on the precipice a pivotal election is a threat to the people of this nation to exercise their right to a fair and free election,\" said Derrick Johnson, NAACP president and CEO. The U.S. Postal Service did not comment on the lawsuit but pointed to an earlier statement from DeJoy. He said the agency is ready to handle \"whatever volume of election mail\" it receives this fall and will put off certain reforms until after the election. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich on Wednesday\u00a0rejected\u00a0a public plea from his state's top elections official to investigate service changes at the USPS, accusing state Secretary of State Katie Hobbs of undermining \"public confidence in Arizona's election process.\" Hobbs, a Democrat,\u00a0expressed disappointment\u00a0online over the response from Brnovich, a Republican, pointing to recent legal action filed by nearly two dozen Democratic attorneys general over the postal service controversy, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. In her letter, the secretary had warned of \"a larger, coordinated scheme\" by the Trump administration to \"interfere\" with mail voting. The two officials are at odds over several other issues in the predominantly vote-by-mail state. A federal court is expected to issue a decision soon over one such dispute: a court challenge over Arizona's deadline for resolving unsigned mail ballots. Also in Arizona, some conservative activists tell\u00a0Tin\u00a0they are outraged over receiving GOP mailers bearing a photo of Mr. Trump and urging recipients to apply for mail ballots, despite the president's public skepticism of the process. They are urging fellow Republicans in group messages, on social media\u00a0and in web posts\u00a0to voice their frustration to a state party they fear is \"helping the Democrats win.\" The party-funded advertisements have also blanketed potential battleground states from\u00a0from New Mexico\u00a0to Florida. \"Like the president wisely stated, mandating mass universal mail-in voting in states that are unprepared and ill-equipped to manage the process is a terrible idea and opens up the possibility of flaws and fraud in our elections, Thankfully, Arizona has been conducting mail-in voting for more than two decades,\" said Greg Safsten, executive director of the Arizona Republican Party, in a statement. Safsten also praised Arizona's mail voting system as \"safe and secure.\" A state party spokesperson said they had received only a handful of inquiries in response to their mailer. An aide to Nevada's attorney general is rebuking former state Secretary of State Dean Heller's accusation Wednesday\u00a0on a Trump campaign press call\u00a0that \"duplicate voting\" had gone unprosecuted in the state. Heller, a Republican who also previously served a term in the U.S. Senate for Nevada, falsely claimed that \"in all cases\" the state had refused to prosecute such crimes, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0\"While our office cannot discuss the prosecutorial decisions of former attorneys general, under Attorney General Ford's administration, our office takes allegations of voter fraud extremely seriously,\" Monica Moazez, communications director for the state's current attorney general, said in an email. Though acknowledging that voter fraud was rare, Moazez said the office had prosecuted one such case: a southern Nevada man\u00a0charged last year\u00a0with voting twice in the 2016 election. Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio and local leaders held a press conference at the local United Steelworkers in Akron, Ohio, following Mr. Trump's call to boycott Goodyear tires. Goodyear is headquartered in Akron. \"[Trump] has not been here for working-class people or working-class communities like Akron,\" Ryan said.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Trump called for a boycott after CBS Topeka, Kansas, affiliate\u00a0WIBW-TV\u00a0reported that some Goodyear employees at a local plant were told that there was a \"zero tolerance\" policy for wearing clothing with political messages. USW International President Tom Conway said in a statement that the president and his staff neglected to help Goodyear as it was closing a tire plant in Alabama. \"It would have been nice if the president would have paid as much attention to that loss of American jobs as he does to his MAGA hats. Maybe a tweet or two back then would have been helpful,\" Conway added. The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted 5-1 Thursday to sustain a challenge to the timing of Kanye West's filing in the state, thereby kicking him off the ballot in the swing state. The WEC just made the decision during a Zoom meeting on Thursday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Michael Curran, an attorney representing West's campaign, argued the papers were turned in seconds before 5:01 p.m., thereby satisfying the 5:00 p.m. deadline to file. However Attorney Jeffrey Mandel, representing the challengers, disagreed with the notion of one-minute grace period between 5:00:00 and 5:00:59, and argued the papers were in the physical possession of election officials after 5:01 pm. After bringing on two election officials directly involved, they testified the representatives for West's campaign spent some time putting page numbers on the filings once in the office, and that the papers were in actual possession of election officials several minutes after 5 p.m. West's camp has not identified yet whether they would appeal the decision. Republican Bob Spindell was the only member to vote against the motion, saying that the timeline was pretty close, and that as soon as a representative from West's campaign walked into the building, it should have mean that their papers were on time. \"Mr. West is an African American candidate, and I think we should do all we can, after the terrible treatment that the black population in Milwaukee received during the April election, that we give them a choice,\" Spindell said. West was kicked off the ballot in Montana on Thursday as well, after a review found he had an insufficient amount of valid signatures. West has now been kicked off/withdrawn in three states: New Jersey, Montana and Wisconsin. Illinois has a hearing on his filing Friday.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's campaign has launched a social media ad blitz aimed at encouraging supporters to vote by mail, a move that follows months of Mr. Trump's open attempts to discredit the practice and tie it to election fraud. One ad has the headline \"VOTE LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP!\" and includes the text, \"TIME IS RUNNING OUT! Request your ballot today.\" The image shows a close-up of an absentee ballot. The ad, a reference to the absentee ballot the president sent for this year's Florida Republican primary, is appearing on Facebook in Florida and North Carolina. Another ad includes the text \"Absentee ballots are GOOD. I need you to get your application and send in your absentee ballot IMMEDIATELY.\" The campaign spent at least $2.5 million on the twelve ads that had the broadest reach, according to Facebook data, targeting at least 11 million voters. Other Facebook ads from Mr. Trump's campaign about getting an absentee ballot have also targeted Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania. The president has for months said without evidence that\u00a0voting\u00a0by mail could be tied to widespread fraud and abuse. Palm Beach County election records showed that the president and first lady Melania Trump were mailed ballots at the Mar-a-Lago resort for the Florida August primary. It was not until around that time in early August that the president started claiming voting by mail specifically in Florida was safe. Palm Beach County election records do not currently show absentee ballot requests for the 2020 general election on file for the president and first lady. The deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot in Palm Beach County is October 24. \"Look, that's a good campaign doing what it's supposed to do, getting people to vote. They want people to be out there and doing this independent of what the president is saying on the podium,\" said Daniel Kreiss, a University of North Carolina Chapel Hill associate professor whose research looks at digital media, data and analytics in contemporary campaigning. Trump campaign spokesperson Thea McDonald said in an email that Mr. Trump has \"rightly and consistently said that when a voter cannot make it to the polls, they should request an absentee ballot, just as he himself has done.\" The Trump campaign vote-by-mail ads come as Democrats see a massive advantage in absentee ballot requests across several key battleground states with just under 20 days to go before Election Day. Read more from\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News investigative reporter Graham Kates\u00a0here. Mr. Trump made two stops in the battleground state of Florida on Friday, before heading to Macron, Georgia for another airport hangar rally. A\u00a0Reuters/Ipsos\u00a0poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Trump in a statistical tie with Democratic rival Joe Biden in Florida. A report by Florida Secretary State Laurel Lee Thursday revealed state Democrats' longtime voter registration edge is disappearing, down to just 134,000 over Republicans ahead of Election Day, the closest margin in recent history. In 2012,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0notes Democrats held a 535,987 voter edge when President Obama captured the state. In 2016, Democrats maintained a 327,428 person lead when then candidate Donald Trump won. Mr. Trump hosted an indoor event Friday with more than 300 guests in Fort Meyers, Florida, centered on \"protecting America's seniors.\" The president told audience members, \"We cannot allow unscientific, panic-driven, fear-based policies to deny our children and grandchildren their future and their dreams.\" The president's\u00a0diminishing support\u00a0from older voters comes amid a pandemic that has disproportionately impacted senior citizens. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 8 out of 10 COVID-19-related deaths reported in the United States have been among adults aged 65 years and older. The president receives poor marks, according to\u00a0CBS News polling, on his handling of the virus. Both presidential candidates appeared\u00a0in separate town halls on competing networks on Thursday night after President Trump said he would refuse to participate in a virtual debate. President Trump was in Miami at a contentious town hall\u00a0hosted by NBC News' Savannah Guthrie. When asked if he would denounce\u00a0QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory group, Mr. Trump refused to unequivocally do so,\u00a0CBS digital reporter Caitlin O'Kane\u00a0reports. While members of the group frequently appear at Mr. Trump's rallies and campaign events, Mr. Trump insisted he doesn't know about the group. \"What I do hear about [QAnon] is that they're very strong against pedophila, and I agree with that,\" he continued. According to the\u00a0Anti-Defamation League (ADL), \"QAnon is a wide-reaching conspiracy theory popular among a range of right-wing extremists and even some public supporters of President Trump.\" The group first surfaced on 4chan in 2017 and adherents follow \"the anonymous Q.\" CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0also reports Biden and his entities outraised Mr. Trump, the RNC and their joint fundraising committees by about $135 million last month and have a $180 million cash advantage. Late Thursday night, Mr. Trump's campaign communications director revealed on Twitter the president and his entities raised a combined $247.8 million in September and had $251.4 million cash on hand. This comes as the Trump Victory Fund faced a quarterly filing with the FEC. It showed the joint fundraising committee brought in $119 million from July through September and transferred out $69.5 million to other authorized committees. Among its $9.5 million in operating expenses were $335,753.76 to the Treasury Department for air travel, $110,510 to Impact Health Biometric Testing Inc. for an \"Event Staging Expense,\" and at least $769,000 to the Trump Hotel Collection for everything from travel lodging to meetings, parking, facility rentals, and catering services. The Thursday filings also revealed the president accepted more than $1 million from QAnon supporters Caryn and Michael Borland. The donation was first reported by The Associated Press. Last month, CBS News confirmed Vice President Mike Pence would no longer be attending a Montana fundraiser with the couple but a campaign official could not confirm why. The move came one day after the AP reported the couple had \"shared QAnon memes and retweeted posts from QAnon accounts.\" Biden spoke outside Detroit in Southfield, Michigan, on Friday afternoon, his third trip in the last five weeks to the state according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. Biden was joined by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and both of the state's Democratic senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. Peters is currently campaigning to hold his seat. Biden called the group who allegedly planned to kidnap Whitmer are \"domestic terrorists\" and compared the their plot to one the radical terrorist group ISIS would engage in. He also accused Mr. Trump of calling the group to action when Mr. Trump tweeted \"liberate Michigan.\" And in case you missed it...If you've heard Biden talk at all, you know about his Scranton roots. His campaign last month condensed his message to \"Scranton versus Park Avenue.\" A few days ago,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0went to Scranton to talk to voters and he saw the election energy - by both campaigns - in the town. Obama/Biden won the area by double digits in 2012, but Hillary Clinton barely won in 2016. The Trump campaign is zeroing in on Biden's home turf and Democrats are hoping Scranton will remain in the Democrats' column with a little extra boost. But there is anxiousness. \"I don't care if he was from Timbuktu,\" kindergarten teacher Mary Pat Burke, 55, said during a front porch interview a few doors down from Biden's childhood home. \"It just seems that he seems very in tune with the needs of the middle class.\" But Burke, like other Democrats in the area, said there is no guarantee. \"After last election, I don't want to be too overly confident.\" Read the full story\u00a0here. The suburbs were America's battleground in several states during the 2018 midterm elections and are poised to play a major role in determining who wins the presidency. The suburban counties around Milwaukee, known collectively as the WOW counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington), remain solidly Republican territory. They've been the heart of the Republican Party in Wisconsin for years and will very likely provide a large chunk of votes for Mr. Trump. But,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports the president struggled in the area four years ago relative to other Republican candidates in recent years and Democrats are hoping to shave off a few more votes. Collectively, Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 28.3 points in the WOW counties in 2016. That was slightly better than John McCain's performance in 2008, when he beat Barack Obama by 25.9 points in the WOWs, although Mr. Obama won Wisconsin by the largest margin in decades that year. The counties were much more favorable to Mitt Romney, who won them by 35 points. The WOW counties were even better for former Republican Governor Scott Walker, who won them by about 45 points in 2010 and 2014. When Walker lost to current Democratic Governor Tony Evers in 2018, he carried the WOWs by 35 points. How well the president needs to perform in the WOW counties depends on several factors, including his margins in the Green Bay area and the rural areas of Wisconsin where he blew out Clinton four years ago. \"I think he does need to do better in that area,\" said Wisconsin Republican strategist Mark Graul, referring to the WOW counties. \"He won the state with even getting those lower margins in the WOW counties than historically Republicans have gotten, so I don't want to say he needs to do that much better if he can increase the turnout in some of these rural areas, which I think he will.\" Graul thinks the president's strongest card in the WOW counties will be the economy, especially before the pandemic hit. \"They like lower taxes and less regulation and want to see businesses and employers doing well, so I think the president has a strong message there and that's one that probably he should focus on with those voters,\" Graul said. Pence and Eric Trump both campaigned in Waukesha County this week, a sign that the Trump campaign is taking the Republican stronghold seriously and wants to drive up the margins. Waukesha is the largest of the WOW counties and in recent years has typically accounted for about two thirds of the votes from the three counties. Democrats in the county are feeling confident that they've been able to peel some voters away from their Republican roots and point to flipping Walker's former State Assembly seat, which is partly in Waukesha county, as evidence that they're gaining support. \"We often say this isn't the Bush Republican Party or the McCain Republican Party, but this is no longer even the Paul Ryan Republican Party,\" said Matt Mareno, chair of the Waukesha County Democrats. The county is highly educated with many wealthy residents, and Mareno believes Democrats can win some of those voters who may be fiscally conservative, yet socially liberal. He said some of the issues driving Democrats and Biden supporters in the county include healthcare, the coronavirus pandemic and Mr. Trump's response to unrest in Kenosha. Mareno thought Mr. Trump's law and order message would resonate with Waukesha voters, but said that was not the case. \"A lot of people felt he was here to do nothing but fan the flames,\" Mareno said. The Waukesha County Republicans have been holding events to showcase the enthusiasm among the president's supporters in the county and organizing other grassroots events. CBS News reached out to the Waukesha County GOP, but the county chair did not respond to an interview request. In one of the latest edition of CBS News COVID Chronicles,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0re-visits the battleground state of Michigan, to explore how matters have changed regarding a moratorium on water shut-offs in the city of Detroit. In March, Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggans launched the Water Restart Plan for Detroit residents who were at risk of a service interruption due to nonpayment. When CBS News spoke with water advocates in July, they applauded the effort by the city and state to help residents access water services throughout the duration of the coronavirus pandemic but warned that the plan was a temporary fix to a longstanding issue that needed a permanent solution. In July, the ACLU Michigan filed a lawsuit against the city of Detroit, the DWSD, and the state of Michigan. Jason Bailey is the Special Economic Justice Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense fund, co-counsel with the ACLU Michigan in the case. Bailey said that since the summer, both the state and the city have filed to dismiss the case. And earlier this month, the Michigan Supreme Court\u00a0ruled\u00a0that Whitmer doesn't have the authority to issue or renew COVID-19 related executive orders, a move that water advocates say could complicate water service access to vulnerable communities amid the pandemic. \"People that we're representing had issues affording water before the pandemic and before the governor issued her moratorium...there's really concern that once things go back to the way they were before the executive order, that they'll be without water service,\" said Bailey. \"The threat is very real.\" Students in the Milwaukee Public Schools last saw their teachers in-person in mid-March before the COVID-19 pandemic forced Governor Tony Evers to shutter the schools. This set off a chaotic effort to ensure students were still receiving basic needs, including free breakfast and lunch, and figuring out remote instruction once it became clear students wouldn't be returning to the classroom. Seven months later, virtual learning continues in Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS), Wisconsin's largest school district, and it's not clear when students will return, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. When the decision was made in July to\u00a0start the year virtually, some parents applauded the district for taking the safe route, while others spoke out against the plan. Those parents didn't think the spring semester had worked out well and feared students would fall behind. \"When it happened in the spring, it was crisis management,\" said Nicolo Onorato, a special education teacher, referring to the frantic aftermath when schools closed. \"We're better than we were last year because we understand a little bit better. And if we're going to keep understanding it better, we're still going to get better.\" Joyce Peoples, a middle school English language arts teacher, said things are going more smoothly in her class now, compared to the spring, but worries about prolonged virtual learning. \"I don't think this is sustainable,\" Peoples said. She added, \"After three or four months of this, you might see students just start to like go into this slump again about 'I'm not getting up and doing this this morning.'\" She feels she's \"more effective\" now than in April, and there are fewer disruptions and more students are doing the work. But still, she said of her students, \"I think it's just very hard for them to sustain an excitement about learning through a screen.\" CALIFORNIA California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Attorney General Xavier Becerra told reporters on Friday that the state Republican Party has agreed to \"no longer deploy unstaffed, unsecure, unofficial, and unauthorized ballot drop boxes,\"\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. \"The Republican Party's deployment of these unofficial and deceptive drop boxes were in violation of state law and they created voter confusion,\" Padilla said. But the state GOP said Padilla and Becerra \"didn't bother to learn the facts before accusing us\" of wrongdoing. \"They want to do anything to confuse to confuse voters and our supporters, and let our detractors describe our efforts as criminal,\" California Republican Party chairwoman Jessica Milan Patterson told reporters Friday afternoon. California Republicans say they never used unauthorized, unstaffed and unsecure drop boxes and insist they didn't make any concessions to Padilla and Becerra. \"In two phone calls with nine Attorney General lawyers, they never requested the California Republican Party to do anything except provide information about our program and to turn over records, including names of voters which we have declined to do,\" Hector Barajas said, a spokesman for the CRP said in a statement Padilla and Becerra told reporters their investigation is ongoing, and they have issued a subpoena for more information about the state GOP's ballot collection efforts. The California Republican Party General Counsel Tom Hiltachk said as of Friday afternoon he hasn't received a subpoena. Becerra said the cease and desist order earlier this week was issued \"after getting information and reports of activity with regard to voter and ballot drop boxes.\" Over the weekend, local news outlets reported ballot drop boxes in Los Angeles, Orange and Fresno counties. One of the\u00a0reports\u00a0included a California Republican Party staffer posting a photo of a drop box in Orange County with the label \"official\" on it while another report showed a similar box\u00a0outside a church\u00a0in Fresno County. The California Republican Party admitted the \"official\" label that appeared on the boxes was a mistake from an \"overzealous\" staffer. That was corrected within hours of the GOP finding out about it, according to Hiltachk. Regarding the ballot box outside the church, Hiltachk said the pastor who posted the photo online \"was taking a picture of the box as it was being delivered to his church.\" Hiltachk said on Wednesday that the box was in transit from a vehicle to the church and never left unattended on the sidewalk as it appeared in the photo. \"It's understandable that if you thought that was our program that perhaps a local registrar or voter would be concerned about that,\" Hiltachk said earlier this week. \"But that is not the program that's being undertaken here and any characterization of it in that way is simply false,\" he added. In a letter responding to the cease-and-desist order, the California Republican Party said it intends to \"accept VBM ballots voluntarily delivered by voters to a local Party office or headquarters through Election Day.\" The state party also said it would secure the ballots in a locked box until they are delivered to election officials, no later than 72 hours from receipt. Furthermore, California Republicans said they will \"ensure that such boxes are attended to at all times the office is open to the public\" and make the boxes available to any person or organization wanting to participate in ballot harvesting. \"The California Republican Party has not and will not place boxes unattended, outdoors, or in other places where the general public gather; and represented that such boxes are 'official' VBM drop boxes,\" the California GOP wrote in a letter to Padilla and Becerra. Barajas told CBS News the GOP will continue to have ballot drop boxes at locations like churches and party offices where they will always be staffed and remain secure as originally planned. \"What they accused us of doing was never done,\" Hiltachk told reporters on Friday. \"What we've told them is that the program we had been undertaking, we are going to continue to undertake under those terms.\" Becerra said he and Padilla \"will continue the investigation\" and \"respond\" when \"credible evidence\" suggests that California election law is not being complied with. \"We wait to see what the Republican Party does,\" Becerra said. \"Based on what we find the evidence to be in terms of their activities, that will determine what we do and that's why I have said we are in ongoing conversation,\" he added. Florida is aiming to be the poster child, not problem child, for elections this year\u00a0reports\u00a0CBSN politics reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns. Unlike in other key battlegrounds in the Midwest, Florida can start processing ballots weeks before Election Day. Huey-Burns visited a facility in the Sunshine State that is processing 10,000 per day. CBS News also found that the president's rhetoric on mail in voting is having an impact on his own supporters. Voters that spoke with CBS News casting their absentee ballots were backing Biden. And voters elsewhere in the state who said they were backing Trump noted that they would be casting their ballots in person on Election Day. Dr. Michael McDonald, an elections expert at University of Florida, said 800,000 more Democrats than Republicans requested absentee ballots, when the number is usually at parity. Republicans, however, have been narrowing the registration gap. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced on Friday that people will not be allowed to openly carry guns at voting locations, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Benson issued guidance to local clerks that said people can't openly carry a firearm \"in a polling place, in any hallway used by voters to enter or exit, or within 100 feet of any entrance to a building in which a polling place is located.\" People can leave firearms in their cars within 100 feet of a building if they are otherwise legally allowed to do so. Further, Benson noted that concealed carry is not allowed in any building that already prohibits the practice. \"The presence of firearms at the polling place, clerk's office(s), or absent voter counting board may cause disruption, fear, or intimidation for voters, election workers, and others present,\" Benson wrote in her memo. Benson's guidance comes eight days after state and federal officials charged more than a dozen men in connection to an alleged kidnapping plot of Governor Gretchen Whitmer that included plans to attack the state Capitol. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that more than 55,000 Ohioans have volunteered to serve as poll workers on Election Day, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In a press release, LaRose's office noted that 72 of Ohio's 88 counties have met or are close to meeting their poll worker recruitment goal for the election. LaRose's office specifically noted that Hamilton and Franklin counties, which have large populations, and Summit County need to recruit more than 500 poll workers in each of their counties. \"We're so close to ensuring a full complement of poll workers to staff our thousands of polling locations across the state,\" LaRose said in a statement. \"If you've ever wondered what it's like to serve your community and perform an important patriotic duty in a time of need, here's your chance.\" CALIFORNIA Democratic Representative Harley Rouda of California appears to have violated the STOCK Act, which requires members of Congress to report stock sales and purchases within 45 days reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. According to Rouda's August 20th periodic transaction report, he waited months to publicly disclose four separate transactions. All but one of the transactions are over a year old. On two of the transactions, Rouda profited at least $200. In April of 2019, Rouda sold his shares of Rock Brands, a footwear company, which was in the amount of $100,000 to $250,000. Rouda sold more stocks of Rocky Brands a few months later in September of 2019. In addition to requiring members of Congress to report transactions within 45 days, the STOCK Act prohibits representatives and their employees from using private information gathered from their official positions for personal benefit.\u00a0 A senior Rouda staffer said the congressman's lawyers flagged the transactions during the 2020 Personal Disclosure Filing period. The staffer added that Rouda immediately filed the required Period Transaction Report. Rouda also paid the associated fine in order to be in compliance once he was made aware, the Rouda staffer said. The reports are considered timely if they are received or postmarked on or before the due date, which is 30 days after the member of Congress has become aware of the transaction, according to the STOCK Act. Extensions are not granted and $200 penalty is assessed for the late reports. \u00a0 CAMPAIGN CASH While some challengers in crucial districts Republicans need to flip the House posted strong fundraising quarters, incumbent Democrats still have massive overall leads in the money race.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that in the 30 districts Mr. Trump won in 2016 currently represented by a Democrat, the incumbents raised a collective $43 million and have more than $57 million cash on hand going into these next few weeks. By comparison, Republican challengers brought in a cumulative $30 million and have $16.8 million cash on hand. There are several bright spots for Republicans, as three challengers in these districts have now outpaced their Democratic opponents in both fundraising this quarter and with their cash on hand. Four other Republican challengers in districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 also posted more than their Democratic opponents, including Young Kim in California's 39th, who also holds the cash on hand advantage. Republicans need a net gain of 17 seats to take back the chamber, but that task is made harder by the expanded battlefield House Democrats have been playing in. At least 32 Democratic challengers have out raised their Republican incumbent or candidate for open seats.\u00a0Navarro\u00a0reports these Democratic challengers raised about $300,000 more on average between July and September. One of the wider margins is in the open seat in Virginia's 5th, where Democrat Cameron Webb raised $2.7 million compared to Republican Bob Good's $722,724. For competitive districts in presidential battleground states, Democrats continue to have a slight lead. Of the six tight races in Pennsylvania, Democrats raised a collective $6.4 million while Republicans brought in $5.7 million. Two Republicans out raised their opponents: Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and challenger Sean Parnell. In Florida's handful of six competitive House races, it was split: three Democrat and three Republican candidates posted higher numbers this quarter. For the 12 competitive races in Texas, nine Democrats had the higher fundraising quarter while eight Republicans still hold the cash-on-hand advantage. For example, in Texas' 21st, while Democrat Wendy Davis raised $3.4 million in the quarter, GOP Congressman Chip Roy has more cash on hand with $2.4 million in the bank. Republican Maryland Governor Larry Hogan cast a write-in vote for late former president Ronald Reagan last week, his office confirmed to\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0on Friday. Hogan, a frequent critic of President Trump, is not supporting Mr. Trump nor the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. Hogan's decision to vote for Reagan was first reported by the\u00a0Washington Post. According to the\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker,\u00a0which tracks races based on CBS News polling and analysis, there is overwhelming support for Biden in Maryland. \"I know it's simply symbolic,\" he told the Post. \"It's not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I'd like to see in office.\" It's not the first time Hogan chose not to vote for Mr. Trump. In 2016, Hogan\u00a0endorsed\u00a0New Jersey Governor Chris Christie during the primary season and then wrote in his father, former\u00a0Representative Lawrence Hogan, in the general\u00a0election. He joined Massachusetts\u00a0Governor Charlie Bakerand Vermont Governor Phil Scott in not supporting Mr. Trump in the upcoming election. Baker's office said Thursday in a statement obtained by CBS Boston that the \"governor cannot support Donald Trump for president and is focused on seeing Massachusetts through the pandemic.\" Scott had previously voiced support for the impeachment proceedings and said Trump \"shouldn't be in office.\" Scott is favored to win his re-election this year, and Hogan's office confirmed he would be taking part in a town hall with Baker for Scott's campaign on October 22. Democratic candidate and Lieutenant Governor Mike Cooney called for his Republican opponent, Congressman Greg Gianforte, to suspend his campaign's in-person activities until he tests negative for COVID-19. Gianforte attended an event on October 3, two days before a debate between the two, that local health officials approved. But after several positive cases were found linked to the event, they asked other attendees to monitor themselves. \"The focus isn't on whether the event was the right or wrong thing to do, we simply need to quickly identify cases and their close contacts if we are to have a chance at containing disease and preventing an outbreak,\" Drenda Niemann, health officer for the Lewis and Clark public health department, told the\u00a0Associated Press. Gianforte's campaign said he led the Pledge of Allegiance at the October 3 event, and then left. Jake Eaton, Gianforte's campaign manager, told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0he has shown no symptoms. \"As Montanans confront this virus and economic crisis, it's a shame that career politician Mike Cooney is so desperate that he's politicizing public health for his personal, partisan gain,\" Eaton said. His campaign added that Gianforte's health care provider did not recommended that he should be tested.",

            "article_content": "Russia is \"amplifying criticisms\" of voting by mail in order to undermine trust in the electoral process, according to a bulletin by the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0obtained by\u00a0CBS News intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gazis. Analysts from the Department's intelligence arm conclude that Russian state media and proxies will likely \"promote allegations of corruption, system failure, and foreign malign interference to sow distrust in democratic institutions and election outcomes.\" \"We assess that Russia is likely to continue amplifying criticisms of vote-by-mail and shifting voting processes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to undermine public trust in the electoral process,\" the bulletin by the agency's Office of Intelligence and Analysis says. \"Decisions made by state election officials on expanding vote-by-mail and adjusting in-person voting to accommodate challenges posed by COVID-19 have become topics of public debate.\" The contents of the bulletin were first reported by\u00a0ABC News. The bulletin says that Russia would likely continue its campaign to undermine public trust in the electoral system, as it did during the 2016 and 2018 elections. It gives the example of Russian state media sowing discord during the Iowa caucuses in February by claiming the election was rigged. \"In the Iowa Caucuses in February, Russian state media and proxy websites claimed that the contest was fixed in favor of establishment candidates and that technical difficulties with the caucusing mobile voting application led to ballot manipulation,\" the bulletin says. \"These outlets continued this narrative into March 2020, claiming that the Democratic Party made a corrupt back-room deal to orchestrate the exit of establishment candidates to consolidate the vote behind former Vice President Biden in advance of the Super Tuesday primary elections.\" An unprecedented number of Americans are expected to cast their vote by mail ahead of the November election, due to the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis has previously raised concerns about Russian interference in 2020. CBS News confirmed that DHS\u00a0withheld publication\u00a0of a July intelligence bulletin to law enforcement agencies warning that Russia might try to undermine Joe Biden's candidacy by denigrating his mental and physical health, citing \"quality concerns\" about the report's sourcing. The bulletin raised the possibility that \"Russian malign influence actors\" would promote allegations about candidates' health \"to influence the outcome of the 2020 election.\" President Trump has repeatedly attacked voting by mail, promoting baseless claims that mail-in voting would lead to greater cases of voter fraud. In June, Mr. Trump claimed on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0that \"millions\" of mail-in ballots would be printed by \"foreign countries,\" leading to the \"scandal of our times.\" U.S. officials said\u00a0last week\u00a0that there is \"no information or intelligence\" about any foreign actor attempting to compromise mail-in voting, contrary to Mr. Trump's claims. Mr. Trump also tweeted on May 26 that \"There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-in Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.\" The tweet prompted Twitter to issue its\u00a0first ever fact-check of the president. However, he has also urged supporters in Florida to vote by mail, and has himself\u00a0requested his own mail-in ballot\u00a0for Florida's primary election. In a separate assessment, issued\u00a0last month, the U.S. intelligence community said Russia is actively seeking to \"denigrate\" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and that actors linked to the Kremlin have tried to boost Mr. Trump's candidacy. Joe and Jill Biden met with the family of Jacob Blake on Thursday in Milwaukee. During this meeting, Biden said he spoke with Jacob over the phone and was impressed by his resilience,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \"[Jacob] talked about how nothing was going to defeat him, how whether he walked again or not he's not going to give up,\" Biden recounted later during a meeting with community leaders in Kenosha. \"It was very obvious that Vice President Biden cared as he extended to Jacob Jr. a sense of humanity, treating him as a person worthy of consideration and prayer,\" Blake family attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. After describing how his slate of plans addresses systemic inequalities in the country -- like establishing a White House national commission on policing -- Biden turned to politics. The Democratic nominee said, \"there's a lot of folks that thought well the president has made great strides\" with his recent \"law and order\" rhetoric. Whispering into the microphone, Biden responded, \"He hasn't -- not at all.\" For his part, Biden said he is \"optimistic\" about change. \"I promise you -- win or lose -- I'm going to go down fighting -- I'm going to go down fighting for racial equality, equity across the board,\" Biden told the approximately 20 people gathered in socially-distant pews at Grace Lutheran Church. The Democratic nominee's campaign arranged for the Kenosha community leaders to explain to Biden how life has been since Blake, 29, was shot by police in the back on August 23. Responding to a local business owner whose building was looted, Biden quoted his \"buddy John Lewis\" and said, \"protesting is protesting...but none of it justifies looting, burning or anything else.\" He added, \"So regardless of how angry you are, if you loot or you burn, you should be held accountable as someone who has done anything else. Period. This just cannot be tolerated.\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defende President Trump's comments encouraging supporters to vote twice, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. During a Wednesday campaign stop in North Carolina, President Trump suggested voters \"test\" the mail-in voting system by purposefully attempting to vote-by-mail and in-person -- an illegal act, considered a felony in several states. \"The president does not condone unlawful voting,\" McEnany said Thursday, adding that reporters are taking the president \"out of context.\" But the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) issued a statement Thursday warning, \"It is illegal to vote twice in an election.\" In fact, it's a Class I felony, the statement said, quoting North Carolina law, for \"a voter 'with intent to commit a fraud to register or vote at more than one precinct or more than one time...in the same primary or election.'\" The statement also notes that soliciting a person to try to vote twice \"is a violation of North Carolina law.\" North Carolina begins sending out mail in ballots tomorrow, making the Tar Heel state the first in the nation to begin sending and collecting ballots for the November election. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that to date, the NCSBE has received an unprecedented 618,842 absentee ballot requests -- more than 16 times as many absentee ballot requests submitted at this time in 2016. Though the president won the state by 173,315 votes in 2016, a recent Fox News\u00a0poll\u00a0shows him trailing Democratic contender Joe Biden by four percentage points among likely voters in the state. After making visits to North Carolina twice within two weeks, Mr. Trump heads to a different swing state, Thursday night: Pennsylvania. The visit to the Pittsburgh area comes on the heels of Biden's address there Monday, where he accused Mr. Trump of inciting violence in American cities. In 2016, Trump edged out Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania by less than a percentage point. A\u00a0Quinnipiac poll\u00a0of likely Pennsylvania voters released Thursday shows Biden at 52% and Trump at 44%. President Trump is expected to carry his message of \"law and order\" to Pennsylvania voters. Mr. Trump directed the Office of Budget Management Wednesday night to explore cutting federal funding to cities where he says \"weak mayors\" are allowing \"anarchists\" to \"harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses.\" The official memo sent by Mr. Trump to the OBM chief and Attorney General William Barr accuses Democratic state leaders and mayors in cities including Portland, Seattle, and New York of allowing \"persistent and outrageous acts of violence and destruction.\" Mr. Trump has painted protesters demanding social justice and fair treatment of minorities by law enforcement as \"thugs\" and criminals, in keeping with his campaign message. Vice President Pence campaigned in Raleigh a day after President Trump visited the state. With a group of police officers standing behind him in the scorching heat, the vice president accepted the endorsement of the Southern States Police Benevolent Association, calling it a \"great honor.\" During the less than 20-minute speech, Pence reiterated the administration's message of law and order, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. He said too many Americans have died defending the country's freedom for the president to allow Americans \"to strike each other.\" Pence added that law and order will be restored in all cities for every American of every race, color, and creed. He also criticized Biden, saying he finally \"got out of his basement this week and went to Pennsylvania,\" and added that the Democratic nominee failed to mention the \"anarchists\" in the streets. Under President Trump, riots and looting have accompanied some of the protests for social justice across America in recent months but Pence claimed it will be Biden who will \"double down\" on polices that have led to violence. He also repeated that Americans \"won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.\" In recent months, several police unions, including the Arizona Police Association, the Milwaukee Police Association, and now the Southern States Benevolent Police Association have all endorsed President Trump. Campaign spokesperson Gates McGavick said in a statement the endorsement \"underscores our commitment to law-and-order and keeping our communities safe.\" According to Accountable.US, a nonpartisan national government watchdog group, police organizations have received nearly $16 million in small business relief funds after a $150,000 lobbying campaign by police organizations for support during the coronavirus pandemic. Accountable. The U.S. says the Southern States Police Benevolent Association, which represents more than 60,000 law enforcement officers, took up to $2 million in PPP funds ahead of today's endorsement. North Carolina Democratic Party communications director Austin Cook called today's visit from Pence \"a distraction from the crushing reality\" that North Carolinians are facing as a result of COVID-19. \"Today's photo ops do nothing to support the families who have lost loved ones or are battling this disease right now,\" Cook added. The number of Americans applying for unemployment assistance edged up in the last week of August. About 833,400 people applied for first-time unemployment aid in the week ending August 29, the Labor Department\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday. CBS News digital editor Irina Ivanova\u00a0reports\u00a0that's an increase of about 7,600 from the previous week, not accounting for seasonal adjustments. Another 759,000 applied for a special program for self-employed workers called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. That figure rose 151,000 from the week before. A fuller picture of how the labor market is faring will come on Friday when the Labor Department releases hiring data for August. \"It's the third week in a row of rising initial unemployment claims (non-seasonally adjusted),\" Indeed Hiring Lab economist AnnElizabeth Konkel said in a note. \"Nearly six months into the pandemic, this is an alarming trend. While this data won't show up in tomorrow's jobs report, we will get a better picture of the overall economy then. As for what we know right now, things aren't looking rosy.\" On a seasonally adjusted basis, initial unemployment claims fell by 130,000 from the week before, to about 881,000. However, the government this week changed how it calculates seasonal adjustments for unemployment figures, making the current numbers not directly comparable with their historic levels. Overall, the figures show that\u00a0layoffs are continuing\u00a0nearly six months after the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0first swept across the U.S. Employers in August announced 115,000 job cuts, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, with industries from\u00a0transportation\u00a0to local government promising more cuts in the fall. \"[T]he pace of layoffs still remains very high, and it appears that the proportion of newly laid-off people quickly finding another job is falling,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note. Economists have warned that a failure by lawmakers to deliver another major round of financial stimulus to workers and businesses could hinder the recovery and even plunge the U.S. into a second recession. \"This latest report adds to a growing list of indicators pointing towards an overall plateau and a long road still ahead for the labor market,\" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at career site Glassdoor. After a searing speech during the Democratic National Convention, former First Lady Michelle Obama is trying to fire up people to vote. She headlined a \"Registered and Ready\" rally Thursday hosted by her non-partisan organization, When We All Vote. \"The consequences of sitting out this election could not be more serious,\" Obama said. \"With so much confusion and misinformation out there. It's got to be on us to set the record straight.\" It marks one of the first appearances by the former first lady since her DNC speech last month, reports\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. \"Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,\" Obama stated on the opening night of the convention. \"He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.\" With 61 days until the election, organizers pegged the virtual rally as a call to action and encouraged eligible voters to register and create a plan to vote early in-person or by mail. The group also promoted a week of action from September 20-27 to sign up voters, one of several events scheduled ahead of the election. Obama challenged volunteers to register as many people as possible and pointed to her convention speech as a reminder of how a \"handful\" of votes can make a difference in the outcome of an election. \"The margin of victory or loss in elections is so small,\" Obama cautioned. \"In the last election, in one of the swing states, I reminded people it was two votes per precinct, and I want you all to sit with that truth.\" Republican Sen. Martha McSally was on board for part of the \"Trump Women's Tour\" this week in her home state of Arizona, the campaign's bus rallying groups of supporters throughout the battleground state with top state party officials Kelli Ward and Pam Kirby joining Mercedes Schlapp, a senior adviser to the president's campaign. \"This careless bus tour is just the latest move to show Arizonans that Trump and his campaign don't take the science, the experts, or this pandemic seriously,\" Quiana Dickenson, political director for the Arizona Democratic Party, said\u00a0in a statement. Both McSally and the president's campaign have drawn a contrast with their rivals, hosting in-person events and voter outreach as Democrats have hewed to a mostly virtual campaign over coronavirus concerns, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"The enthusiasm is there. The ground game is here. We're talking to voters. In a state like Nevada, our ability to have these conversations person-to-person is so important,\" Erin Perrine, a top spokesperson for the Trump campaign,\u00a0told Fox News\u00a0amid the bus's swing through neighboring Nevada last month. According to a local Jacksonville newspaper, the city could be on the hook for nearly $154,000 in convention-planning expenses for the Republican National Convention even though the event ultimately didn't take place in Jacksonville. The Florida Times-Union reported Wednesday evening that \"more than half the cost stemmed from overtime pay for employees working to prepare for the convention, mainly by Jacksonville Sheriff's Office employees who were tasked with getting security preparations done in a tight time frame.\" CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that in June the president\u00a0announced\u00a0he would accept his party's nomination in Jacksonville after disagreements ensued about how to host the event amid the coronavirus pandemic in Charlotte, North Carolina. But a month later, the president\u00a0called off\u00a0the Jacksonville portion of the convention citing a spike in coronavirus cases in Florida. According to the Florida-Times Union, the chief of staff for the Jacksonville mayor has previously stated that while the city spent staff time, no taxpayer dollars were spent on the convention and added that \"any time a special event comes to Jacksonville,\" the city's emergency operations center and the sheriff's office work on preparing for it. In Nevada, where the president first\u00a0floated in a tele-rally\u00a0his now-controversial suggestion that supporters attempt to vote both by mail and later in-person, the state Democrats\u00a0are denouncing Bill Stepien, the president's campaign manager.\u00a0CBS news campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Stepien had suggested on Fox News that Democrats would be able to \"find\" more ballots among casino workers. Thursday afternoon, Twitter placed a public notice on two of three of President Trump's tweets Thursday encouraging Americans to vote twice. The first tweet, which falsely referred to \"unsolicited and solicited ballots\" was not marked by Twitter.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0notes, however, that no one in the country will receive an \"unsolicited ballot.\" Registered voters who live in an automatic vote-by-mail (VBM) state will get a ballot because they are registered. Ballots are not sent out indiscriminately. In states where mail-in voting isn't automatic, registered voters must apply to receive a ballot at home. Only registered voters who request to vote by mail will receive their solicited ballot. Mr. Trump followed with two tweets explaining his rationale behind telling supporters to vote twice, which Twitter said violated its Civic Integrity Policy. The president said voters should go to their polling place to see if their votes had been counted, and if they had not yet been counted, then they should vote in person. Korte\u00a0notes it's important to understand the difference between a ballot being processed and a ballot being counted, especially because, in many states, ballot counting does not begin until Election Day. Processing occurs on a designated day after the ballot is received: it is verified, taken out of its envelope, secured, and prepared to eventually be counted. If voters try to cast their ballot in person after sending in their ballots by mail, they will be stopped if their ballots have been processed. Asking if your vote has been counted will most likely get you a \"no\" but that doesn't mean your vote won't count.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden now has the public support of all of the major candidates who ran against him for the Democratic nomination, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Elizabeth Warren Wednesday morning announced her endorsement of Biden for president in a video posted on Twitter, citing the former vice president's empathy, public service and role in implementing the Recovery Act after the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0 \"When Donald Trump is gone, we will need to do more than heal a nation that has been bitterly divided,\" she said. \"We will need to rebuild and transform our country. And I've seen Joe Biden help a nation rebuild.\"\u00a0 As a candidate, Warren had said she would support the Democratic nominee no matter who it turned out to be but stayed out of the fray as Biden fought Bernie Sanders for the nomination. Although Warren is more ideologically aligned with Sanders, Biden last month adopted Warren's plan to repeal key pieces of a bankruptcy bill she fought Biden on 15 years ago.\u00a0 After endorsing Biden, Warren put her massive grassroots network built during her own presidential bid to work in order to help the former vice president. In an appeal sent to Warren's supporters this afternoon using her email list,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says Biden made a direct pitch to those who had previously been receiving updates from the Warren campaign.\u00a0 \"I know, for some of you, that you might be skeptical of me or my campaign. I understand that. But I intend to earn your votes. And I intend to earn your trust,\" the email signed by Biden read. \"I'm here to tell you that you're not only welcome as part of this campaign: you're needed. The only way that we'll defeat Donald Trump is with a broad coalition of folks working together to win what I have been calling a battle for the soul of our nation. I'm not here to ask you for money \u2014 I believe I need to earn it. So I'm asking if you will look me over, give me a chance, and join my campaign.\"\u00a0 The email included a link that would redirect people to sign up for Biden campaign updates. The Biden/Warren crossover email comes after Warren amassed millions of dollars from millions of donors during the primary from grassroots support; the only other Democratic presidential candidate to eclipse her in grassroots fundraising was Sanders. Using her list to get former supporters to sign up for Biden could be a major step in helping the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee build up his grassroots support heading into the general election. \u00a0 Senator Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin, also threw her weight behind Biden Wednesday, the day after he won her state's primary.\u00a0 \"I'm supporting Joe Biden for president, not just because he's always fought for the bold progressive change that working families in Wisconsin need that because he understands that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect and afforded the opportunity to thrive,\" she said in a video posted on YouTube. Both Baldwin and Warren are considered potential vice presidential picks for Biden, who has said he plans to begin vetting potential candidates soon. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN At his virtual town hall this afternoon, Biden pivoted from high-profile politicians to speak with workers who continue to work through the pandemic, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. He also continued to criticize President Trump's actions during this time, honing in on the president's demeanor. Biden said Mr. Trump should not have \"temper tantrums\" and \"harangue the press\" at his briefings.\u00a0 \"Have we heard him offer any sincere message of empathy that people are hurting?\" Biden said. \"I don't think this is appropriate conduct for a president.\" He also downplayed Mr. Trump's belief that he will be able to reopen the economy, equating it to relying on a \"miracle\" happening tomorrow. In his conversations with the union workers, he spoke with a meat packing shop steward in Pennsylvania and then a paratransit driver and grocery clerk from Michigan. He said it was a \"moral duty\" to ensure protective equipment, paid leave and potential extra pay for workers like them.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP Kayleigh McEnany made her move from national press secretary on the Trump campaign to press secretary at the White House official Wednesday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. She took over the @PressSec twitter account from Stephanie Grisham Wednesday morning, adding her profile photo and sending her first tweet, \"Honored to join the\u00a0@WhiteHouse\u00a0as President Trump's\u00a0@PressSec. I look forward to connecting the American People to\u00a0@realDonaldTrump's agenda and sharing the historic successes of this Administration.\"\u00a0 The move was confirmed on April 7 by White House officials. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale thanked McEnany on April 8 for her time on the campaign in a statement saying, \"We don't think of it as losing a team member, rather as having a trusted colleague called upon to fill a very important role. President Trump has made an excellent choice.\" The Trump-RNC fundraising committee plans to expand their joint operation, placing finance chairs in all 50 states, RNC senior officials confirm to\u00a0CBS News. The announcement was first made Tuesday on a Trump Victory phone call with bundlers, led by Trump campaign senior adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle and top fundraiser Roy Bailey. In 2016, the Trump campaign named finance chairs for only 33 states.\u00a0 The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the ongoing legal battle over disclosure of President Donald Trump's tax returns and business records on May 12, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Trump's appeals in three cases aimed at stopping Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees and a New York prosecutor from accessing his financial records were originally set to begin March 31, but postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Forced to amend its in-person tradition, the Supreme Court announced earlier this week it will break from precedent to hear arguments via teleconference. While justices and attorneys will participate remotely, the court will provide a live audio feed of arguments on CSPAN radio. Former President Jimmy Carter said he is \"distressed\" by President Trump's decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization.\u00a0 \"I am distressed by the decision to withhold critically needed U.S. funding for the World Health Organization, especially during an international pandemic. WHO is the only international organization capable of leading the effort to control this virus,\" Carter wrote in a statement tweeted earlier today.\u00a0 President Trump announced Tuesday the U.S. plans to withhold funding for the World Health Organization, pending a White House review. He blamed the international organization for helping to accelerate the COVID19 pandemic. \"So much death has been caused by their mistakes,\" the president told reporters during a briefing in the Rose Garden. Rapper and retail mogul Kanye West says he is voting for President Trump in November. In a\u00a0GQ Magazine interview out today,\u00a0West cited the real estate market as a motivating factor. \"I buy real estate. It's better now than when Obama was in office,\" the musical artist said. West later added, \"I'm definitely voting this time. And we know who I'm voting on. And I'm not going to be told by the people around me and the people that have their agenda that my career is going to be over. Because guess what: I'm still here!\" The news comes one day after rapper Cardi B, longtime supporter of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, endorsed presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden via Instagram livestream. \"I'm just gonna go with Joe Biden because I cannot see the next step of America being ran by number 45,\" she said, in reference to the current president. LIFE AFTER 2020 ELIZABETH WARREN Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith are calling for at least $50 billion in emergency federal funding to be used to keep the child care industry running during and after the coronavirus pandemic. \"We will not be able to rebuild our economy if this country's child care system has collapsed beneath the economic burden of this pandemic,\" they wrote in a Medium post Wednesday.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the proposal would give aid to child care centers bearing the cost of intensive cleaning and increased hours of care for the children of essential workers. It would also provide funding for providers who have been temporarily closed by the pandemic to keep their staff on payroll. The senators also proposed long-term investments toward child care infrastructure and worker wages. Warren spoke about the volatility of the industry on the trail and proposed universal childcare legislation in early 2019.\u00a0 VEEPSTAKES STACEY ABRAMS Though the process of choosing a vice presidential running mate is shrouded in secrecy, one of the women on Biden's list is making it clear she's interested.\u00a0 \"I would be an excellent running mate,\" former Georgia General Assembly Leader Stacey Abrams told Elle magazine in an interview published Wednesday morning. Abrams also listed the high points of her resume for the magazine, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. \"I have the capacity to attract voters by motivating typically ignored communities. I have a strong history of executive and management experience in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. I've spent 25 years in independent study of foreign policy. I am ready to help advance an agenda of restoring America's place in the world. If I am selected, I am prepared and excited to serve,\" she said. With the glossy profile in the fashion mag, it would appear that Abrams is trying to keep her profile high as veepstakes loom. Abrams held a press call this afternoon with fellow co-founder of Fair Fight 2020 Oregon Governor Kate Brown (D). The two spoke about their ask of Congress to add $4 billion of campaign funding in the fourth COVID19 stimulus package for mandate and implantation of at-home voting in November. ISSUES THAT MATTER TO YOUR HEALTH As health coverage remains a heated topic of debate in the 2020 election cycle,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says state regulators could see insurance rates rise when companies make their filings for 2021 in the coming months amid the coronavirus pandemic. According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, private insurers pay as much as $20,000 for comparable pneumonia hospitalizations and more than $80,000 for patients who require a ventilator during their stay. With uncertainty around the coronvirus' impact on next year's costs, the KFF said it could lead insurers to overprice plans, particularly in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. \u00a0 Meanwhile, while hospitalization costs for Medicare and Medicaid patients would be lower on average because those programs typically pay lower rates than private insurance, the KFF analysis also found Medicare spending could rise because older adults are at a higher risk of coronavirus related hospitalizations. The new costs could potentially be offset by fewer non-urgent procedures and hospital visits, but an increase in Medicare spending could still mean higher premiums and cost sharing in the future. State Medicaid programs will likely also experience increased costs from both COVID-19 treatment as well as more enrollments as millions lose job-based coverage. IN THE POLLS VOTER TURNOUT Seventy percent of Democrats say they are \"certain\" to vote in the upcoming presidential election, a\u00a0new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows, surging nine points over the first quarter of 2016. And 71% of Republicans say they too will vote, a three-point increase over the last election season. However, the results belie steep electoral puzzles facing Joe Biden's campaign as it ramps up for the general election.\u00a0 For example, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, turnout among black voters in 2016 \u2014 a key share of the Democratic base \u2014\u00a0dropped for the first time\u00a0in two decades of presidential elections. Beyond turnout, analysis of voter files\u00a0by The New York Times\u00a0found President Trump flipped large swaths of white, working-class Obama supporters. And less than a quarter of Biden's supporters report strong enthusiasm for the candidate, according to\u00a0a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, the lowest of any Democratic presidential candidate in 20 years.",

            "article_content": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a proclamation on Thursday that will reduce the number of mail-in ballot drop-off sites in the state to one per county. Abbott said the change would \"strengthen voting safety in Texas.\" The new rule, which goes into effect on Friday, will also allow poll watchers to observe activity at the drop off sites,\u00a0CBS Dallas/Fort Worth\u00a0reported.\u00a0 \"The State of Texas has a duty to voters to maintain the integrity of our elections,\" Abbott said at a press conference, the station reported. \"As we work to preserve Texans' ability to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must take extra care to strengthen ballot security protocols throughout the state. These enhanced security protocols will ensure greater transparency and will help stop attempts at illegal voting.\" While the proclamation does little to counties like Tarrant and Denton, it has a significant impact on counties with larger populations. Harris County, which is home to Houston and is the third-largest county in the U.S, will lose 11 established drop-off sites, The Associated Press reported.\u00a0 Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner criticized the decision. \"Growing up, I was bused over 20 miles as a student in the first integrated class at Klein High School. Because of the Governor's decision today, I would now have to go even farther to drop off an absentee ballot and make sure my vote is counted,\" he said. Turner called the decision to reduce the number of sites \"a direct attempt at voter suppression,\" and said, \"We should be focused on making voting more accessible and stop trying to create obstacles and distractions with unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\" In a press release, Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa called the decision a failed attempt to change voting rules \"at the last minute.\" In a statement to CBS News, a Texas Democratic Party official confirmed that a lawsuit was in progress. The ACLU of Texas also strongly condemned the order in a statement, calling Abbott's decision \"another thinly disguised attempt to stymie the vote.\"\u00a0 Texas is one of the only states that has not expanded vote-by-mail during the coronavirus pandemic, despite Democratic attempts to expand mail voting access in the state. In order to be eligible for mail-in voting, you must be either 65 years or older, disabled, out of the county on Election Day and early voting period, or in jail but otherwise eligible.\u00a0 Back in July, Abbott extended the early voting period by six days. Texas Republican Party Chair Allen West and other prominent Texas Republicans sued Abbott in September over the decision, and the case has yet to be decided by the Texas Supreme Court. \u00a0 When Abbott expanded early voting in July, he said it was part of a strategy to \"preserve Texans' ability to vote in a way that also mitigates the spread of the virus.\" Letting people deliver mail-in ballots by hand, he said, gave people \"greater flexibility\" and protected people from COVID-19.\u00a0 Texas' new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are no longer on a downward trend, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.\u00a0 Other states that normally require an excuse to vote by mail, like Kentucky, New York, and New Hampshire, are allowing voters to use coronavirus as an excuse. President Trump has repeatedly argued that expanding mail-in voting will lead to fraud, even though election experts say cases of fraud are incredibly rare.\u00a0 So what does this mean for larger counties? Many constituents will have to travel long distances to drop off their mail-in ballots, which could have a disproportionate impact on low-income voters or voters of color. Harris County contains almost 25% of the state's Black residents. Lina Hidalgo, the Harris County Judge, tweeted, \"Harris County is bigger than the state of Rhode Island, and we're supposed to have 1 site? This isn't security, it's suppression.\" Local clerks have announced which sites will remain open. The deadline to request an absentee ballot in Texas is still October 23, and mail-in ballots must be postmarked by November 3 and received by 5 p.m. on November 4 in order to be counted for most voters.",

            "article_content": "On the eve of the Nevada caucuses, every candidate (except Tulsi Gabbard and Michael Bloomberg) is stumping in the state to turn out supporters ahead of Saturday's \"first in the West\" contest. And a new poll from CBS Las Vegas affiliate KLAS shows Nevada remains Bernie Sanders' race to lose,\u00a0with the senator polling at 30.4%\u00a0\u2014 nearly double Pete Buttigieg at 16.9% and Joe Biden at 16.1% behind him.\u00a0 Of the early campaigns to staff up operations in Nevada last year,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says only Sanders and Elizabeth Warren remain in the race. The Sanders team has touted building Nevada's largest staff, numbering more than 250, with outside backers like Make the Road Nevada and National Nurses United swelling their volunteer ranks.\u00a0Despite a spat\u00a0with the Culinary Workers Union, one of Nevada's most prominent unions, Sanders has picked up the support of a massive teachers union and labor leaders in the state. Behind Sanders, Buttigieg's team is smaller but boasts key strategic hires for Nevada's delegate contest. Under state director Paul Selberg, who formerly led the Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus staff, and national caucus director Travis Brock, former head of the state party, the campaign was the first to open outposts in far-flung rural Nevada towns like Pahrump and Fallon and claims nearly half of their organizing team speaks Spanish. Biden has secured key allies for navigating the Nevada caucuses like State Senator Yvanna Cancela, former political director to the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, and swing district freshman Congressman Steven Horsford. And even beyond locking up the high-profile\u00a0endorsement of the Latino Victory Fund\u00a0on Thursday, Biden has jockeyed with Sanders for a lead in polling of the coveted Latino communities that make up nearly one third of Nevada. And looking for an upset beyond the top-polling contenders in the KLAS poll are Warren at 12.1%, Amy Klobuchar at 11.0%, and Tom Steyer at 9.8%. All three are within the survey's margin of error of each other and below the so-called viability threshold (15% in most precincts) to qualify for delegates. But that hasn't stopped them and the other candidates and outside groups from spending more than $6 million in television and radio ads put together in this final week, per Kantar CMAG data. And given the wide field, all the White House hopefuls stand to pick up additional support during realignment of the nearly 75,000 Nevadans who have already cast early votes and the remaining caucus-goers Saturday, including those braving a rare rain forecast in Las Vegas. JOE BIDEN Can unions save Joe Biden's campaign?\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports\u00a0from Las Vegas that the big bet the Biden campaign is putting into their pro-union message in the state. After disappointing finishes out of the top three in Iowa and New Hampshire, aides and allies hope the \"middle-class Joe\" mantra will sway Nevadans to turn around his political fortunes. The pro-union message has only grown more dire as Biden rings the alarm that proposals like Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan will eliminate the private insurance many union workers on the Las Vegas strip bargained to get. And even if this strategy succeeds in Nevada, can unions\u2014whose membership nationwide has been cut in half over the past 20 years\u2014and their support boost him past his rivals? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Michael Bloomberg announced Friday that the women who have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) will be permitted following growing pressure from Democratic rivals like Warren. CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports that Bloomberg announced in a statement his reversal and he listed steps he will take with his company and further legislative action he would take if elected president about workplace discrimination. \"I've had the company go back over its record and they've identified three NDAs that we signed over the past 30-plus years with women to address complaints about comments they said I had made,\" Bloomberg said. \"If any of them want to be released from their NDA so that they can talk about those allegations, they should contact the company and they'll be given a release,\" Bloomberg added. Bloomberg also said leaders at his private company Bloomberg LP will \"review and reform our policies where necessary with regard to equal pay and promotion, sexual harassment and discrimination.\" He also said that if elected, he would work to pass the Be Heard Act in Congress and he will encourage business leaders to \"support women beyond what is mandated by Congress.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Warren has threaded a line between pitches of herself as a uniter and as a fighter, but since the start of the Nevada debate, she's had the gloves off. Warren, a former contract law professor, read a covenant she had drafted to release Bloomberg's former employees who are bound by non-disclosure agreements on a CNN town hall Thursday night. It was disqualifying, she said, that Bloomberg had stuffed \"a gag in the woman's mouth.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the act is reminiscent of how Warren acted in the Senate. During Jeff Sessions' 2017 attorney general confirmation hearing, she refused to stop reading a letter on the Senate floor that criticized Sessions' actions as a senator. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said about Warren: \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\" \"Nevertheless she persisted\" has become Warren's tagline.\u00a0 Bloomberg's decision to in fact release some former employees from NDAs helps Warren's argument that she can play rough enough to take on President Trump. But Warren, confronted in January with apparently the most dire financial situation her\u00a0 campaign has faced, has also shown a new desire to contrast herself from her opponents. Speaking about fellow progressive Sanders on MSNBC on Thursday, Warren said \"I get real stuff done ... I don't want to be a president just to yell at people. I want to be a president to change things.\" To this point, Warren's new strategy is working. Her campaign announced it has raised over $17 million in February alone, it's best month yet.\u00a0 BILLBOARDS ON BLAST Bloomberg is looking beyond the war being waged against him by the Democratic primary field toward general election opponent President Trump, trolling him with billboards where the president himself is campaigning in the West this week.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0has exclusively learned that billboards are going up in Phoenix and Las Vegas, where Mr. Trump campaigned Friday. The billboards are appearing in high visibility areas near a Trump hotel property on the Vegas Strip, and also along potential motorcade routes where the president may see them as he drives by. Should Mr. Trump look out the window of the presidential limousine, he could see billboards blaring, \"Donald Trump cheats at golf,\" and \"Donald Trump eats burnt steak.\" There's also \"Donald Trump lost the popular vote\" and \"Donald Trump went broke running a casino.\" In a statement released by the campaign, Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen said \"Americans deserve to know that Donald Trump cheats at golf and went broke running a casino.\" The feud between the two New York billionaires has escalated since Bloomberg began to see a sharp uptick in polling amid his enormous ad spending. In Bloomberg's second FEC filing, his campaign reported spending over $460 million dollars total since he entered the race in late November through the end of January. \u00a0 According to the ad tracking service Kantar/CMAG, the campaign will have spent more than $415 million in TV, radio and digital advertising since its launch. After Bloomberg's lackluster debate debut this week, Mr. Trump took to Twitter Wednesday night to mock the former New York mayor's performance, tweeting, \"Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!\" WRITING ON THE WALL A Knoxville, Tennessee office for Bloomberg was vandalized Thursday overnight with expletives and language that the Bloomberg campaign says echoes language used by Sanders. According to WVTL, the Knoxville Police Department said they received a complaint of vandalism at the office. The police department said they are investigating the incident and no suspects have been identified.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports that Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement that the campaign has experienced multiple instances of office vandalism in various states over the last week and is calling on Sanders to condemn the attacks and accused the Sanders presidential campaign of using \"Trump-like rhetoric,\" that encourages this behavior. When asked for a response to the story from CBS News, the Sanders campaign said they were not commenting. \"This latest incident at our Knoxville campaign office is exactly what we've been warning about. We don't know who is responsible for this vandalism, but we do know it echoes language from the Sanders campaign and its supporters.\" Sheekey said. \"We call on Bernie Sanders to immediately condemn these attacks and for his campaign to end the Trump-like rhetoric that is clearly encouraging his supporters to engage in behavior that has no place in our politics.\" SOUTH CAROLINA Is South Carolina still Joe Biden's firewall?\u00a0CBS News reporters LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0Nicole\u00a0Sganga\u00a0report\u00a0Biden has expressed confidence in his support from African Americans throughout the primary cycle, and black voters are expected to make up 60% of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina. But an NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll released Tuesday showed his lead over Bernie Sanders among black voters has shrunk to just three percentage points. On Monday, the campaign kicked off a bus tour with Jill Biden who insists that her husband's \"firewall\" remains intact and invoked her late son, Beau Biden, in talking about the unique bond she and her husband feel with the state. \"The people of South Carolina know me. They know Joe,\" Jill Biden said. \"We were here, like I said, after our son Beau died. This is where we came to try and heal. And when there was the mass shooting at the church, we came to that service. I mean, we love the state of South Carolina.\" A CBS News analysis shows Biden has spent 18 days in South Carolina since launching his campaign. By comparison, he was in Iowa for 61 days and in New Hampshire for 23 days. Biden has spent nearly $400,000 on South Carolina television and radio advertisements this month alone, much less than the seven-figure investments made in Iowa and Nevada. This week, Biden's Super PAC, Unite the Country, has invested just under $74,000 total in local radio advertising, according to Kantar Media. Amid the crowds of voters Dr. Biden addressed however, there was a sense that this might be the former vice president's last stand, and some of his supporters here harbor doubts about him. \"I would say I am a Biden supporter, but I'm also very interested in Amy Klobuchar,\" Scott McBroom said as he awaited to see Jill Biden in North Charleston. \"Frankly, had he run four years ago, I would have been volunteering myself. But what I'm seeing so far concerns me. He's not as sharp as he was four years ago.\" TEXAS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is throwing her weight behind a progressive candidate seeking the nomination in Texas' crowded Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Ocasio-Cortez said on Friday that she is endorsing progressive organizer Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez in the race to challenge Republican Senator John Cornyn in November. The endorsement, first reported by the\u00a0New York Times, comes less than two weeks before primary day in Texas and while early voting is already in progress. Ocasio-Cortez's support for Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez is part of a slew of endorsements for progressive women in races across the country through Ocasio-Cortez's PAC, Courage to Change. \"When I am in the Senate, I will fight for the bold, progressive change that Texans deserve, including securing an economy with living wages, high-quality healthcare for all, and real action on climate change.\",\" Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez said in a statement about the endorsement. Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez is one of at least 11 candidates running for the Democratic Senate nomination in Texas. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes during the primary, there will be a runoff between the two candidates who receive the most votes. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed Air Force veteran MJ Hegar in the primary. Hegar led the most recent\u00a0Texas Tribune/University of Texas\u00a0poll of the Senate race with 22%. \"Texans are going to vote for someone who is outside the political system and embodies Texans values of strength, courage, and independence,\" Hegar's spokesperson Amanda Sherman said in a statement in response to Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says that while Ocasio-Cortez's organization represents a contrast with the House Democratic campaign arm that protects incumbents, none of the endorsed House races conflict with any of their \"Frontline\" members. Nebraska's 2nd district, where Courage to Change endorsed Kara Eastman, is the only race that does overlap with DCCC's target list. In a fundraising pitch, the PAC mentions the campaign arm. \"When community leaders, activists, and working-class candidates try to run for office, organizations like the DCCC discourage them.\" The PAC's\u00a0website\u00a0adds that \"corporate interests, elite donors and insular party power structures disincentive many potential leaders from running for office.\" In a statement from Jessica Cisneros, who is looking to topple Congressman Henry Cuellar in March 3 primary, she said she's \"honored by this endorsement and to be part of the movement across the country to fight for a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and standing up to Trump's anti-immigrant agenda.\" Both campaigns have been running attack ads against each other in the past few weeks. Cuellar's campaign manager Colin Strother told\u00a0Navarro that \"it has historically been considered as very poor taste for members to endorse against other sitting members. I feel pretty confident that we're standing with the right people. And we're more than happy to let her tout her endorsements from the Congresswoman, as well as Bernie, Elizabeth Warren.\"",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 With college campuses closed, festivals and concerts canceled, and motor vehicle offices shuttered, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted not only the normal way of life for millions of Americans, but the traditional means of voter registration during an election year that could attract record turnout. Now, civic groups devoted to signing up new voters are trading clipboards for web pages and retooling the ways through which they reach prospective voters ahead of the remaining primaries and the general election, when voters will cast their ballots for president all the way down to their local district attorney. \"Most people that we interact with register to vote by an organizer or volunteer on their college campus with a clipboard in their hands,\" Charlie Bonner, communications director of MOVE Texas, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase youth participation in elections, told CBS News. \"Now that campuses have closed, those efforts all stopped.\" While 39 states and the District of Columbia offer online voter registration, Texas is among the small handful that does not. As a result, Bonner said the coronavirus pandemic forced MOVE Texas to build out its website to allow prospective voters in the state to request a voter registration form, which the group then mails with all postage paid. \"This is a very difficult state to register in on a good day,\" he said of Texas. \"We are now on the worst day.\" Before the pandemic began its rapid spread across the United States, MOVE Texas registered more than 7,000 people in the weeks leading up to Super Tuesday on March 3, Bonner said. But as dorms were shuttered and in-person classes moved online, forcing students to leave college campuses and return home, Bonner said the group saw a significant dip in the number of people it registered to vote. To counter that decline as the November election draws closer, MOVE Texas is tapping into the traditional means of outreach \u2014 phone banking, text messaging, social media campaigns \u2014 and applying it to voter registration. The group will be running a texting program to reach new voters and advertisements on social media, as well as hosting online concerts to drive voter registration. \"The infrastructure things being forced by COVID, these new digital outreach structures are critical to reaching young people where they are in a way campaigns have never done,\" Bonner said. Polling shows that Americans have a high level of enthusiasm about voting in the 2020 election, and new voter registrations in the first two months of this year outpaced those in the same time frame in 2016, according to a June report from the Center for Election Innovation and Research. But the report found that in the 11 states that were studied and the District of Columbia, all experienced a drastic drop in new voter registration numbers after the coronavirus hit. In the battleground state of Florida, for example, nearly 110,000 new voters registered in February, but by April, there were just over 21,000 new voter registrations. In February 2016, by comparison, the state saw more than 87,000 new registrations and in April 2016, more than 52,000.\u00a0 Only California and Wisconsin reported more new voter registrations in March 2020 than March 2016, the Center for Election Innovation and Research found. \"Everyone is talking about vote-by-mail, which is great, but you can't even vote-by-mail if you can't register to vote. You can't even have that conversation,\" Bonner said. For the League of Women Voters, the group typically registers voters at high schools, naturalization ceremonies, festivals and public transit locations, said Jeanette Senecal, its senior director of mission impact. The organization was planning to attend naturalization ceremonies between January and November of this year where more than 140,000 people would become new U.S. citizens. \"That's 140,000 people that we had planned to have access to. Now, many of them have not had their ceremony,\" Senecal told CBS News. \"A lot of the opportunities to register voters in person are not really available to us.\" To counter the impacts the coronavirus pandemic has had on voter registration, the League of Women Voters instead created a powerpoint presentation to provide to schools it works with and is looking for new ways to direct voters to its online resources. \"I don't believe there's any state that has had the registration cycles for the comparable election cycles,\" Senecal said. \"Because DMVs aren't open, festivals aren't happening, there aren't as many registrations coming through.\" While the pandemic has roiled registration efforts, many voting groups have found that the civil unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the end of May has led to a surge in new registrations. \"People started to get energized in that moment,\" Bonner, of MOVE Texas, said. \"People getting involved in the hyperlocal level, they're seeing they can make an impact on police brutality and systemic racism by voting for their district attorneys, sheriffs, all these things that are not the sexiest, but it's where people are finding their entry point to make a difference.\" Adorning face masks and armed with hand sanitizer, volunteers with the League of Women Voters are now signing up new voters at rallies and racial justice demonstrations, Senecal said. \"People are seeing that their voice and their vote matters. It matters who was elected to their sheriff, their town councils,\" she said. \"I do think this is a catalyzing moment where people are saying, 'This is a problem, here is one way I can address it: I can register to vote and try to impact change in my community.'\" Rock the Vote, which has run a digital effort for voter registration and turnout for several years now, making it well-positioned in the era of the coronavirus, reported it processed more than 125,000 voter registration applications in June alone, far surpassing the fewer than 40,000 processed in June 2016. Carolyn DeWitt, Rock the Vote's executive director, said the group's platform has processed 525,000 voter registration applications so far this year, a figure it did not hit until September in the 2016 cycle. Rock the Vote has also helped more than 175 organizations transition from registering voters in the field to online since mid-March as they have had to shift their strategies due to the pandemic, she said. \"What we saw around the days leading up to and during the initial protests and continued to see is an increase in voter registration, an increase in sharing information about elections and people really looking to take action,\" DeWitt told CBS News. \"This is bigger than the 2020 election. This is about the values of our country and whether or not we're prepared to handle not just a pandemic, but ready to handle and are bold enough to really look at the systematic racism, structural racism. That's a bigger issue than the 2020 election.\"",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the unprecedented challenges of 2020 are playing out on the campaign trail as the country faces yet another COVID-19 crisis point. Across the U.S. nearly twenty-seven million people have already voted, despite the challenges of casting a ballot in a pandemic. In a bitterly divided country, it may be the only thing Americans can agree on: The importance of voting in campaign 2020. With just sixteen days left before Election Day, President Trump hits rallies as usual, even in red zone states with dangerously high numbers of COVID cases.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Janesville, Wisconsin): We win Wisconsin, we win the whole ballgame. It's--\u00a0(Crowd cheering)\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Janesville, Wisconsin): What the hell do you think I'm doing here on a freezing night with forty-five-degree winds?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's an all-out push for every voting group, particularly those where former Vice President Biden is picking up support.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Johnstown, Pennsylvania): Suburban women, will you please like me?\u00a0(Fort Myers, Florida): We love our senior citizens.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: For the former vice president, it's a referendum on President Trump.\u00a0JOE BIDEN: The only senior that Donald Trump cares about-- the only senior is senior Donald Trump.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And a challenge to hold his temper when faced with Republican attacks and allegations of wrongdoing.\u00a0MAN: Mister Biden, what is your response to the New York Post story about your son, sir?\u00a0JOE BIDEN: I know you'd ask it. I have no response. It's another smear campaign. Right up your alley. Those are the questions you always ask.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the head of the Democratic Party, Tom Perez, as well as former Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus. Plus, we'll take a closer look at our election security with former head of the National Security Agency Admiral Mike Rogers. We'll also hear from former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb about this latest surge of COVID-19. The head of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Raphael Bostic will join us to talk about those hardest hit by the pandemic.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning. And welcome to FACE THE NATION. Coast to coast and around the world, the number of new coronavirus infections continues to rise. There are almost forty million cases worldwide, more than eight million of them right here in the U.S. On Friday there were sixty-nine thousand new reported cases. That's the highest since July. With just over two weeks until Election Day, Americans are now able to vote in all fifty states, and they are going to the polls in record numbers. We've got a lot to get to. We begin this morning with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): COVID America's third wave is so widespread, blindfolded you could throw darts at a map and probably hit a hot spot, like Colorado--\u00a0JARED POLIS: This is the most since late May.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: --and Nashville--\u00a0JOHN COOPER: Our key metrics are not going in the right direction.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: --and Ohio.\u00a0MIKE DEWINE: This thing has roared back.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Roaring by any measure into a public health crisis. Twenty-six states are in the red zone for new infections. In all, thirty-six states have new cases trending up. Five states have positivity rates higher than twenty percent, especially shocking, South Dakota's rate, thirty-six percent, and Iowa, just under fifty percent. Madison, Wisconsin, responded by opening a two-way drive through. On one side people pull in for a COVID test. On the other, they get a flu shot.\u00a0WOMAN: We're really trying to prevent a twindemic. We don't want a lot of flu and COVID happening at the same time.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: COVID's also on the minds of voters and these poll workers in California, PPE is a must. In the Houston area, election workers have their temperatures taken every day.\u00a0CHRIS HOLLINS: Voters are not screened because it is their constitutional right to vote. We cannot prevent them from entering a voting center.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: With sixteen days until the election, early voters keep stampeding to the polls. From coast to coast, masked voters spent the day in lines. In Nevada, standing for four hours. In Georgia, more than ten hours. Pandemic or not, election experts predict Americans may cast a record one hundred fifty million ballots.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: For all the talk that a vaccine is imminent, COVID America's next few months could be rough, with colder weather, holiday travel and gatherings, disease experts predict the viral spread could accelerate. The spike in new cases could be dramatic and daunting. Margaret, that new vaccine can't get here too soon.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta, thank you.\u00a0The recent spike in coronavirus cases is prompting new lockdowns throughout Europe. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer is in London.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. The COVID infection rate in a couple of the world's top hot spots, that is Brazil and India, has actually been declining a little lately. But in Europe, the virus is back with a vengeance.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: In Paris and eight other French cities, police are enforcing a new curfew, checking that anyone on the street after 9:00 PM has good reason. And Germany, where rigorous testing had kept infection rates low, is facing a COVID surge, too.\u00a0(Crowd performing)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: This is Prague in June. A vast public celebration of what Czechs believed was the end of COVID there. They partied too soon, and are now battling the worst outbreak per capita in Europe. Britain is also hard hit. It's imposed a patchwork of restrictions that includes no visiting anyone in another household, even family. In Liverpool, the worst-hit area, hospitals are once again filling up, just as they did this spring.\u00a0WOMAN: We're overwhelmed, and it's not winter. It's not even winter yet.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: To raise the country's battered morale, ninety-four-year-old Queen Elizabeth appeared in public for the first time in seven months, unmasked, but in what must be the safest place in the realm--the military's biodefense lab. Tests of the Oxford vaccine considered one of the frontrunners are going incredibly well, says the project's director. And there was a ray of hope from Kate Bingham, head of Britain's vaccine task force.\u00a0KATE BINGHAM: But I do think we have a-- a shot of seeing the two leading candidates, seeing efficacy of those this side of Christmas.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: But in Yiwu, China, they don't have to wait that long. Doses of a Chinese COVID vaccine made by a state lab were offered to the public as an experiment for sixty dollars a shot. It took only two and a half hours for supplies to run out.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Here in London, the deputy chief medical officer has said that the rollout of the vaccine could start in December. And already a training program for health workers to give the shot is in the works. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz, thanks.\u00a0One Campaign 2020 battleground state also has the distinction of being one of the hottest red zone states in this country. Wisconsin saw a record four thousand one hundred and five new cases on Friday alone. President Trump campaigned there on Saturday. CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang reports.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): President Trump drew thousands of supporters to a Southern Wisconsin airport hangar on Saturday night. The state is grappling with grim, record highs for new positive COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths. But the President claimed the end of the pandemic is near, praising his performance.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're rounding the corner. We've got the vaccines all that. But even without it, we're rounding the corners.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: Even after contracting the coronavirus himself, Mister Trump hosted rallies in seven states last week. The campaign tells CBS News it took strong precautions at all of them. But at each of them, few people wore masks as they stood shoulder to shoulder.\u00a0WOMAN: I do not believe that the masks are going to do what they say it's going to do. I don't believe that it's-- that it's the cure-all that we've all put it out there. I believe it's a symbol of fear.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: In Michigan, the crowd repurposed a familiar chant after the President criticized Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer's efforts to control the virus.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The schools have to be opened, right?\u00a0(Crowd cheering)\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Lock them-- lock them all up.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: On Twitter, Whitmer wrote: \"This is exactly the rhetoric that has put me, my family, and other government officials' lives in danger\u2026\" She was the target of an alleged kidnapping plot by a group that disagreed with lockdown measures. President Trump is also pouring time and energy into the Sun Belt states.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will have a red wave, the likes of which they've never seen before.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: But Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska warned constituents of a blue tsunami, blaming the President for a possible Republican bloodbath in the Senate.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump plans to make two to five campaign stops a day from now until November 3rd, according to a senior campaign official. Today, he will hold a rally outside of Reno, trying to flip this state he lost in 2016. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia Jiang in Las Vegas.\u00a0We want to take a closer look now at two states that went to President Trump in 2016, but now are putting Vice President Joe Biden in the lead. In the typically Republican state of Arizona, former Vice President Joe Biden is three points ahead of the President. In Wisconsin Mister Biden is at fifty-one percent, and Mister Trump five points behind him at forty-six percent. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is in Westchester County, New York, to tell us more. Good morning to you, Anthony. Why is President Trump trailing in these states?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, good morning, Margaret. So, from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt, two states that could be pivotal in the Electoral College count. Let me show you what's going on. First of all, views on how the candidates handled themselves personally, Joe Biden with a significant edge on the President there. Always an important part of voters' calculus. But let me show you this: Such a big part of the President's base in Wisconsin and in other states has been that white non-college vote. He won them by a large gap in 2016. Well, his margin with them this year is down. In this case in Wisconsin from sixty-two to fifty-two percent. And you might say well, he is still winning them. Yes, he is. But for candidates it's about margins, it's about running up the score with groups that support you. Joe Biden cutting into those margins now. That's important. And then this, Margaret, and it partly explains why views that the President is mostly concerned about the wealthy and the elite as opposed to the middle class. Now, neither candidate getting a majority saying they con-- they're concerned mostly with the middle class, but still an edge for Biden there. And then maybe the most important group of all as we head towards election night, millions of ballots are already coming in, people voting by mail across the country. Well, Democrats tell us that they're supporting Joe Biden. They're casting their ballots early. And we see a big lead for Joe Biden among ballots that have already been cast in both Arizona and Wisconsin. I suspect when we get to election night, we may say that Joe Biden has a lead on ballots that have been cast already, and then it's a question of how many of the President's supporters will turn up on election day to try to put him over the top. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, the state of Wisconsin has a serious coronavirus outbreak right now. Is that impacting what voters are thinking?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: Views on coronavirus has-- have been very connected to vote in all of these states. Margaret, let me show you this. Views on who would handle the outbreak better. Joe Biden has an edge in both of these states. And then this, where it really connects to vote, you see Arizona seniors, such an important part of the electorate there, well, a bulk of them feel that the President's coronavirus policies have put seniors specifically more at risk. And the thing here, Margaret, is that of these seniors, almost all of them, ninety-five percent, who feel the President, has put them more at risk are voting for Joe Biden. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, this is the home stretch. I mean what are the closing arguments and how are voters responding?\u00a0ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, we asked people, what do you want politics in the next four years to be like? And of the things that they said, well, the folks who said that they wanted it to be exciting, well, in these states the President has a slight lead. But for those who said they wanted politics in the next four years to be calm, Joe Biden has a large lead. The trouble for the President and the advantage for Joe Biden is that more people told us they wanted things to be calm. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's about tone there. All right. Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much.\u00a0Joining us now is CBS political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. We caught him this morning in between campaign travel and quarantine. Good morning, Ed.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Good to see you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to see you in person---\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --I don't know without the Zoom screen.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: I know. It's nice to be back.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to have you back at the table.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell us about we just heard-- what we just there. I mean, when we look at Joe Biden's schedule, we didn't see him campaign yesterday. We will see him today. What is his strategy? Because President Trump clearly feels he needs to be out and very visible.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: And at this point, the Biden campaign doesn't feel that way much at all. He's-- he's in North Carolina today. The Tar Heel state has begun its early voting. This is a state that the Biden campaign believes, hopes they can take back. But they look at the same kind of polling we do, state by state surveys. Those are the only ones that matter at this point. Don't worry about national horse race numbers. Look at those state by state numbers. They see single-digit advantages, as we do, for Biden. And they worry that if they can't keep their base motivated, if they can't keep convincing people to show up, whether it's earlier on the day off they're going to be in trouble. This week is mostly about the big prep. He will not be seen again after today until Thursday night in Nashville at that next debate. So, they are going to keep him focused on that. That's a signal that they believe this is still a very big opportunity for them to provide one last big contrast with the President and that they have to prepare him for potential attacks from the President. The other thing they're going to continue to do is spend the record sums of money they've raised.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: More than three hundred million dollars in the month of September alone; they've got more than four hundred twenty million dollars in the bank, that's going into advertising, that's going into direct targeting of their supporters across the country through text messaging and e-mail to continue to turn out people. One hundred million dollars alone being spent on what they call voter education or compelling people to show up and vote.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Outraising and outspending the Trump campaign.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: In big ways, in historic ways. By the end of this election, they will have spent more than-- well, near-- nearly half-- more than half-- more than five hundred million dollars. I can't do math this morning. I'm sorry. Too much-- too many numbers. But the point being that is a record sum.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Crazy amounts of money.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Never been done before.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're also seeing that in the other races, not just the presidential race. Another key finding that Anthony Salvanto had in his Battleground Tracker had to do with the Senate race out in Arizona. Mark Kelly, Democrat there, really widening the lead against Martha McSally, the Republican incumbent in that race. This is John McCain's old seat.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: It is.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What-- what is happening in Arizona?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Well, Mark Kelly, the former astronaut, the husband of the former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is the one example across this country we have found where the presidential candidate may ride the coattails of somebody further down the ballot. He's been a huge help to the Biden campaign in Arizona.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: They're convinced they can win that race. They can take back that state for the first time since the 1990s. He raised more than thirty-eight million dollars in the third quarter. Any other cycle, that would be a huge sum.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Astronomical, I might say.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Astronomical. You might say exactly, especially for an astronaut, but dwarfed by the fifty-seven million raised by Jamie Harrison in South Carolina, who's running against the Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. And just because you raise big money remember--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: --doesn't mean you win. Just ask Beto O'Rourke, who raised huge sum two years ago and came up short. That could still happen this year for of these Senate candidates.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: No, key point. And we will have much more to talk about in-- ahead in the show about that race. Ed, so good to see.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Good to see you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION will be back in a minute. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to election security and Admiral Mike Rogers. During the last election, he was the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, which runs military cyberspace operations. Good morning to you. This is--\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS (Retired) (Former Commander, U.S. Cyber Command/Former Director, National Security Agency): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --this is the most watched, potentially most complicated election in the midst of a pandemic that our country has seen. I know in 2016, after the fact, you said you wish more had been done in terms of direct public action before the election took place. What do you think about now? How secure are elections?\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: So, I am very confident that we're going to have an election that will allow us to vote as citizens, that will accurately reflect the results of that voting and will generate a set of results that we can believe in. I think a lot of work has been done. The biggest challenge to me in some ways is the context in which this election is occurring. We're a very polarized and divided nation right now, and we're in the middle of a significant health crisis. So I think there's a few things we need to be mindful of. The first is the turnout, based on everything we've seen, will hit record levels. We need to be prepared for longer lines and a longer process. There's just a whole lot more voters. And, for example, trying to man polling centers in the midst of a pandemic when historically many of your poll workers are older individuals, for example--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: --it's just going to present a challenge. So it's going to take longer. We should be ready for that. Number two, we need to remember elections are run on a state level, so the processes are different. And what is legal and a structure in one state is not the same in another. We need to recognize that and not view that as, hey, there's something wrong because someone else is doing something differently than I am in this election. Number three, I-- I think we need to be mindful it is unlikely that we're going to get a result when we go to bed the night of the election.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: It is very possible, but I think we just need to be ready, given the amount of turnout, given the number of mail-in ballots. In some states, for example, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you can't start counting mail-in ballots until the actual Election Day.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: So we need to be ready for a result that doesn't come out that same night. The last two points I would make, I think, remember, our system allows for legal challenges, legal challenges to process, legal challenges to outcome. That doesn't happen historically all that often at presidential levels, but it often happens at congressional and other levels. We need to let that process play out. And, lastly, remember, there's time built into this process.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: States do not actually have to complete the certification process until the middle of December. So let's just be calm. Let's participate. Let's do it peacefully without violence, and then let's let this system play out just as it has for almost two and a half centuries.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's important expectation setting that you just did there. I want to get to your old line of work and your expertise on the intelligence front, because we know U.S. intelligence says that right now Russia is trying to basically manipulate the public, spread disinformation about the election specifically to hurt the Democratic candidate and some Kremlin-linked actors trying to boost the President. Can Russia, at this point, actually change the outcome of the election by altering votes? Do they have that capability?\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: So, do they have capability? Yes. Is it likely? No, and we haven't seen anything to date that would suggest that we're certainly seeing in cyber the same level of activity that we saw back in 2016. I would say where I think the Russians are doubling down is a little less on cyber activity directed directly against voting infrastructure. Think about voter registration, the actual machines we use to cast ballots, the computer systems we use to tabulate ballot-- voting ballots. I don't think you're seeing that same level of activity. Rather, I think, what you're watching the Russians do is really double down on the idea of using disinformation via social media and other paths to attempt-- to continue to polarize our nation, to incite violence, to incite hatred and to attempt to pull us apart.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So to that point, you know, there's been a lot of speculation that this week some of the information about Joe Biden's son Hunter that has circulated in tabloid in New York Post may be the result of a hack and dump operation. This is speculation at this point that it could have come from Russian military hacking of a Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden served. Do you see any justification for that speculation at this point?\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: Margaret, I don't know the specifics of this case. Again, my view would be, let's let it play out, let's investigate it, let's get some factual evidence, let's get the metadata and let's see if this is accurate or not. I'm just not in a position--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: --really to speculate. I'm not a fan of speculation.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's being compared to the hack and dump operation that happened, as you know, back in 2016. A lot of Democrats alleging that it is that. So when you say you see Russia doing a disinformation and access-- spreading disinformation, is that the kind of thing you're talking about?\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: That could be an element. So when you look at a disinformation campaign, you see the Russians using false identities. So you might think you're talking to a fellow American from the Midwest when actually you're talking to a Russian troll in St. Petersburg.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: So using false identity, using false information, attempting to manipulate images, the use of videos that are distorted to create an impression that is not based in fact, to try to energize individual's emotions, their prejudices, their viewpoints, to galvanize them, to work against, if you will, an outcome that brings us together.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, what is the thing to watch on election night to know if our elections are secure or not?\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: So if you saw an effort on the part of a foreign entity to attempt to manipulate or deny our election processes, the things I would be looking for are, number one, do you see widespread--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: --and I'm not just talking about one or two places, but you see widespread challenges associated with voter registration rolls?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: People show up, they give their license and it doesn't match.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch that--\u00a0ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS: I will be looking for attempts--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Sir, I've got to interrupt you. I'm so sorry, but we will be watching that. Thank you for flagging it. Admiral Rogers, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Americans are voting now or getting ready to vote in the next two weeks. For more information on how to vote in your state, go to CBSNews.com/Vote. We will be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who is in Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We have now eight million infections in the United States, record hospitalizations. In terms of the red zone areas the White House is concerned about, twenty-six states fall into that category. Where are we headed as a country?\u00a0DR. GOTTLIEB: Probably the most difficult phase of this epidemic. I think the next three months are going to be very challenging. There's really no backstop against the spread that we're seeing. We're probably two or three weeks behind Europe. And Europe's in a very difficult position right now, too. I think as we enter the winter, we're going to see continued spread. There's forty-two states where hospitalizations are rising. There's forty-five states where the rate of transfer, the RT is above one, meaning they have expanding epidemics. And there's really no backstop. There's not going to be an intervention that really thwarts this short of the-- the ability to get a vaccine, which is probably an event that happens late in next year.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You point out--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I lost my sound.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I can still hear it, Doctor Gottlieb. I think we're working on being able to reestablish his audio. Doctor Gottlieb, can you hear me?\u00a0Okay. We're going to work on fixing that, and come back to the conversation with Doctor Gottlieb in a moment. But we're going to turn now to another important conversation with the head of one of the twelve banks that make up the Federal Reserve System. That's Raphael Bostic. He joins us from Atlanta this morning. Good morning to you.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President and CEO/@RaphaelBostic): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal just yesterday that pointed to the South, the area of the country you watch most carefully, and said it's been largely-- largely unscathed economically by the pandemic. It's got a 6.9 percent unemployment rate, the lowest of any region as of August. When you look at those numbers, does it vindicate the political decision by governors in the South to go ahead and reopen against the advice of health officials?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, Margaret, I don't know that I would say vindicate. As Doctor Gottlieb was just saying, we're still very much in the midst of this crisis. And one-- one of the reasons I think that the South has benefited is because the virus came to us after it had been to California on the West Coast and New York. And so we had got to learn some things about how we might be able to operate and do our economics with the virus with us. And I think that has turned out to be something that's been quite helpful.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Important caveat there. When you look at Atlanta, in particular, I know you've pointed out in recent interviews that eviction levels are higher than where they were a year ago. What are some of the indicators that you are watching that make you concerned rather than optimistic, as the White House paints us to be on a clear upwards trajectory?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, I'm definitely concerned, and I'm concerned because as I go around and talk to people and businesses in the district, what I see is two real stories going on. In some segments, the economy is re-- recovering and rebounding in a very robust way. But in other segments, things like hotels and restaurants, small businesses in particularly minority and lower-income communities, those places are seeing much more difficult situations. Now when-- if you were to graph this, after the great decline that we saw in March and April, the recovery looks something like this where you have a number of sectors that are going up. This is what I call a less than sign. And in other instances, you're not seeing any recovery at all. And so those segments where we're not seeing that recovery, that's really what I'm concerned about as we move forward.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A-- a dis-- disjointed recovery is kind of what you're sketching out there. You know there was one number that I saw, I read about this week that really stood out to me. And I want to-- I want to share it with you. And it paints this picture of white-collar and working-class America being on really different trajectories. According to the latest Household Pulse data, between seven and eleven million children in this country live in a household where children just didn't eat enough because their household couldn't afford it. This is the richest country in the world. We're being told that the economy is recovering. This doesn't say that to me at all. What does this indicate to you?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, first of all, we have to recognize that-- that the issue of food insecurity is something that we've had in this country for a long time. It's not new, and it's not just a result of the virus. But what the virus has done, it has put a wedge in our economy. And for all those who have been in less-- in more precarious situations it's made them even more precarious. And so those that are been in-- those that have been in distress are in much more distress, while others are not really feeling that at all. And I think it's important to recognize that whatever people are experiencing, there are a lot of other Americans out there who are struggling and are on the edge. And that-- that evictions data is just one example of that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Black Americans have recovered just over a third of employment that they lost during this pandemic. This speaks to what you're talking about in terms of different experiences. According to the Fed, only thirty-four percent of black households own stocks. You've been writing and speaking a lot lately about widening inequality in this country. What needs to be done about it?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, first of all, we have to acknowledge that there's a problem and we have to be willing to talk about it. You know my institution has-- has for a long time not been willing to be out in front to talk about the importance of racial inequalities. I actually think that that's been a mistake. And I-- what we're seeing is many more of my colleagues jumping up and being willing to talk about this. In terms of what to do I think there are two dimensions on this. One is that we have to change the trajectory for the-- the generations to come so they have good schooling, they have good training, they have real access to capital, and they can progress just like everyone else. But we also have a lot of people today who are trying to benefit from this economy and participate in it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: So we need to make sure that we're providing resources and infrastructure to help those people as well.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Joe Biden has been calling for the Fed to start regularly reporting on racial gaps. Your name appeared in a number of reports this week as a potential member of a Biden administration, either as a Treasury secretary or head of the Federal Reserve. Are those jobs you'd be interested in?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: You know, Margaret, there's so much going on right now that I am not thinking about that. I've got a pandemic. I've got an economic crisis, and I've got my own bank to worry about in terms of the-- the policies that we're doing. So I'll let things play out as they-- as they will and we'll just see how that-- how that goes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. That's not a no. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Bostic.\u00a0We will be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go back now to Doctor Scott Gottlieb. We have fixed that technical issue, we hope. You were just saying, Doctor Gottlieb, that we were headed into a very difficult period. You-- you still predict the vaccine as an event well into 2021. When we look at what's happening right now, there's such an outbreak in the Midwest. In Wisconsin, they had their highest daily case total since the pandemic began on Friday. And residents are being told to avoid crowds. But the President held a rally there just yesterday. He seems to not be adopting any further health restrictions even after having recovered from the virus himself. How dangerous is this?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think it's problematic, and I think it's adding to the challenges. Look, the spread we have right now is with the mitigation that we have in place. And so we are taking some steps. If we weren't taking those steps, if people weren't wearing masks generally and some states weren't adhering to some mitigation tactics and we weren't testing and tracing, then we'd have much worse spread. And if you look at the White House strategy, they've come out against universal masking. They've come out against testing asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people. They say testing should be reserved just to the vulnerable. They want businesses and schools reopened, as we all do, and they are against targeted mitigation like closing restaurants. There was criticism of New York when New York kept the restaurants closed. So it begs the question, what is the strategy? And I think the strategy is just to endure the spread until we get to that vaccine. And the reason that's problematic is because even if you get companies filing applications at the end of November, which is what they've said. And I'm on the board of Pfizer, one-- one of the companies developing one of those vaccines. It will take FDA two to four weeks to turn that application around. Then it will take us another two to four weeks to get the initial tranche of people, the most vulnerable who are indicated for the vaccine, vaccinated. Then they need to get a second dose and that happens in the next three to four weeks. And then it takes two weeks for the immunity really to kick in. So you're looking at a situation where the first tranche of people to get vaccinated really won't be protected from the vaccine probably until February and maybe March. And so that's a long way off. We're going to have to endure this wave of spread right now. And it's probably likely to be the biggest wave that we endure without the benefit of a vaccinated population. So we're going to have to rely on those mitigation steps.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking to us from Connecticut. That's a state in the yellow zone. I know you plan to vote in person. But if you live in a red zone state, if you live in the Midwest right now, how safe is it to go out in the midst of an epidemic and vote?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it's-- I think it's possible to protect yourself, but you're going to need to take precautions. You know, the-- the biggest risks are the settings where we let our guard down. And when you talk to the governors about where the spread is occurring, it's occurring in congregate settings where people feel more comfortable, a local Elks Club, a large family gathering. I think when you go out to vote, the voting places are taking precautions. They're-- they're sequencing people carefully. They're cleaning the voting stations in between voters. Their-- their lines are going to be long, but they're going to take precautions inside those settings. And I think when people go out to vote, if they wear a high-quality mask, they can adequately protect themselves. The biggest risks are the settings where we are not on our-- on guard, where we let our guard down, where we are not taking those kinds of precautions. So I think you can vote safely, even in places where there's high prevalence. But you're going to need to be careful.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And when you say high-quality mask, you mean not a cloth one, is that right?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Quality of mask matters. That's what the studies show. And so if you wear a procedure mask, that's going to protect you better, and if you're going to get N-95 masks that's even better.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you said large family gatherings are a major source of spread, are you advising people not to celebrate Thanksgiving?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think people need to weigh their individual risk. If you have people in your family who are vulnerable, I think it's advisable to try to continue to protect them. We have two or three very hard months ahead of us. I think this is probably going to be the hardest phase of this pandemic. The good news is that we have a lot-- a lot of medical treatments and better medical care so we're going to do a better job of preserving life. The bad news is I think we're going to end up infecting a lot more people. And so, you know, we need to get through these next two to three months. And we've made it this far. I know people are exhausted, but we're in this about eight, nine months now, and we have a short period of time to go. We're probably in the seventh inning of the acute phase of this pandemic right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And quickly, we keep hearing about these therapeutic breakthrough drugs. How widely available will they be since we know there are likely shortages?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, they're going to have to be rationed. These are the therapeutic antibody drugs. They're going to have to be rationed, and I think there's going to be challenges distributing them. Right now the plan is to distribute them at emergency rooms. So you're going to have to compel people who are largely well, people who have the infection but haven't yet really developed symptoms because those are the people most likely to benefit, to come into an emergency room to get infused.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's going to be a challenge.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A challenge in the midst of a pandemic. All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis and advice.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go back now to the presidential campaign and check in with both sides. First, we go to the chairman of the Democratic Party, Tom Perez. Good morning to you.\u00a0TOM PEREZ (Democratic National Committee Chairman/@TomPerez): Good morning. Pleasure to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, our CBS Battleground Tracker shows this morning that your candidate, Joe Biden, has the edge in both Arizona by three points, five-point lead in Wisconsin. A lot of that, though, ultimately is going to be dependent on turnout. Do you think the Democratic Party has done enough in the midst of this pandemic to drive up either easy balloting or ability to go to the polls?\u00a0TOM PEREZ: Well, I always caution people never get on the poll-er-coaster. We take nothing for granted and the enthusiasm, Margaret, has been all over the country. You saw the early vote totals in Wisconsin. Over a quarter of the people have already voted in Wisconsin. They voted absentee. You look down in Florida, 2.4 million people voted down there. And what's really interesting is the Democrats are overwhelmingly turning in their ballots. And three hundred and fifty thousand of the Democrats that have turned in their ballots haven't voted in the last two elections. So it's not just people who are voting for convenience, it's people who haven't turned out. And that shows the enthusiasm for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We have a lot more work to do, but we're expanding the battlegrounds. We're competing in places like Arizona, Texas--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --Ohio, Iowa, Georgia, and elsewhere. And-- and that's because we have a candidate who I think is just uniquely qualified to bring people together. He does have a plan to deal with our crisis--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --our coronavirus crisis, our economic crisis. He is a uniter. He's not a divider. And that is why Joe Biden is making the progress he's making.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0TOM PEREZ: But we have more work to do and folks got to get out there and vote.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the Bi-- the Biden campaign has emphasized that, you know, that-- that lead is a lead, but it-- it still could be neck and neck. And, interestingly, when you look at our Arizona poll, the majority of likely voters in Arizona, fifty-six percent, give Democrats more blame than they do to Republicans over the President for not getting an economic relief package to them right now. I mean Americans are in an economic emergency and these negotiations remain more or less stalled on Capitol Hill. Do you think that strategy of holding out for a bigger, better deal is going to backfire for Democrats?\u00a0TOM PEREZ: Well, it's the Democrats who passed a bill five or six months ago and the Republicans did nothing. They're moving heaven and earth to fill a Supreme Court seat so they can undo the Affordable Care Act and undo coverage for people with preexisting--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is blame being--\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --conditions. But they did next to nothing.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --passed around to you now. This is backlash. These are what people are saying they see--\u00a0TOM PEREZ: Well-- well, I don't--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --blame being put here with the Democrats in their view.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: Well, I-- I-- I-- in the last week, I have traveled both to Arizona, to Nevada, and to Florida. And-- and what I've heard from voters throughout those travels, I was with folks in Orlando on Thursday, people working at Disney World. One person is about to-- she's going to lose her health care coverage on Thanksgiving Day. That's when she loses her health care. But the Republicans don't want to pay for COBRA coverage for people who've lost their coverage, who've lost their health care, they've lost their jobs. That's unconscionable. And people understand this is a health care election. In the middle of a crisis we have a President who wants to undo coverage for people with preexisting conditions. He wants to turn the clock back on health care. And it's the Democrats that have been fighting for it. And that's been a big sticking point--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, fighting--\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --in these--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --but-- but--\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --negotiations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --but talking and doing are two different things. And-- and not doing is what Democrats are getting blamed at for here. But I want to ask you about when you're talking about get out the vote efforts, yesterday there was a court that-- that ruled in Republicans favor when it comes to a rule in Michigan about mail-in ba-- mail-in ballots needing to be returned by 8:00 PM on Election Day. This is a state that could really be decisive. How much of a setback is that?\u00a0TOM PEREZ: Well, we've been organizing early in Michigan. We've been organizing early elsewhere. And in Wisconsin, for instance, back in April, the-- the Republicans tried to weaponize the pandemic because they wanted to win a state Supreme Court case. And we won that case. We won it decisively because we outhustled them. We outorganized them. We turned out absentee voters in droves. The same thing that's happening in Michigan. Voters have options in Michigan, thanks to a ballot initiative in 2018. And they're using those options. And you look at the early vote totals and again, Democratic energy. And so we will continue to fight in courts--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't see this is as damaging?\u00a0TOM PEREZ: Well, I would rather-- I-- I believe democracy works better when everyone can cast their ballot and every ballot is counted. We're in an unprecedented pandemic here, and courts in other states have allowed votes that were postmarked by Election Day to be counted as long as they're received within a short period of time after Election Day. This court did it differently. I disagree categorically with that ruling. But we are moving ahead in Michigan. We're moving ahead everywhere. And again, the pandemic in Michigan--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --the pandemic everywhere. This is a crisis. People understand this President has no plan. His closing argument in Michigan is \"lock her up.\"\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: He's fanning the flames of division. He doesn't have a plan for the coronavirus. He doesn't have a plan--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --for the economy. He's divisive. Joe Biden is bringing us together.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: People in Michigan remember that it was Joe Biden and Ba-- Barack Obama who saved the auto industry--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.\u00a0TOM PEREZ: --when Republicans were letting it die.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Tom Perez. Thank you very much, Chairman.\u00a0We're going to turn now to CBS News political analyst Reince Priebus, who was formerly Republican Party chairman. He was also the first White House chief of staff for President Trump, and he joins us from Kenosha, Wisconsin, his hometown this morning. Good morning.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS (Former Republican National Committee Chairman/@Reince/CBS News Political Analyst): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Open up the Washington Post today, I see that you have, as they report, re-entered the Trump campaign mix. They say you're advising him on strategy, including coaching him in that recent NBC town hall. Says you are concerned about the President's chances. Is that right? You're concerned that the President is headed for a loss?\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: No, not at all. In fact, I'm not concerned about that at all. I'm-- I'm-- I'm concerned about early vote. I'm concerned about absentee ballot voting, but I'm always worried about early vote and absentee ballot voting. I haven't reemerged. I have always been helpful to the President, helpful to the RNC. But, look, you know, early vote and where we're-- we're at in a pandemic and having five times more people vote in Florida than ever before, these are unprecedented times. The polling is all over the map. This is something that's going to come down to the wire, and I hope and expect the President to win.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what are the battleground states that you think he can win? Because as you heard from our poll, Joe Biden is at an advantage here.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, Margaret, I mean these polls are really, really complicated to measure. I mean, what we have in this country we have never seen before. We have-- we have regional-- aside from, you know, working class white voters, suburban women, one of the other things that's going on in this country is that President Trump is winning in these rural parts of the country in unprecedented numbers. I mean we have northern Wisconsin, that's like center of Wisconsin to the north, President Trump won by eighteen points in 2016.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Today, he's pushing thirty points ahead in rural America with enthusiasm off the charts. Yes, it's a little bit down in the suburbs. But the hard thing for these pollsters, Margaret, as you bring up, is that they can't measure this kind of disparity between the rural parts of this country and what's happening in the suburbs. So, the real--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think he's still going to win in Wisconsin?\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, I got to tell you, I-- I saw the CBS poll this morning, and I'm not spinning you, I was slightly encouraged by it because in the RealClearPolitics average in Wisconsin in 2016, the President was actually down by six and a half points and he won.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: But also, Margaret, Gary Johnson got a hundred and six thousand votes as well in 2016. So he's not-- Trump didn't just win Wisconsin in 2016 he they said he would lose by six and a half. He won. Plus, another conservative candidate got a hundred and six thousand ballots. So when you ask me--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But one of the things--\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Go ahead.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, one of the things, though, with Wisconsin that our-- our Anthony Salvanto, our pollster, pointed out, though, is that base, that white, non-college-educated voter that came out strongly for the President back in 2016, that margin is-- is shrinking in terms of what we are seeing right now. Why do you think there is that erosion?\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, I don't know if-- if-- if it's an erosion or not, Margaret. I mean, you know, clearly, I think one of the things that you're going to see over the next couple of weeks is that the President's going to be pivoting, talking about the economy. I think this upcoming debate is going to be really important that the President is that, you know, likable, fun, have a good time. Let Joe Biden speak, and let Joe Biden defend the Obama economy. Let him defend why ISIS was running wild and burning people in cages.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Let Joe Biden defend why he was the one guy that didn't want to go forward with the Osama bin Laden raid.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Let him defend the Iran deal. Those are the things that I think, you know, pivoting to the economy that those voters are going to be listening to. But, you know, look, I think it's really complicated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: I don't think anyone can predict early vote and what's happening--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and it--\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: --right now in this country.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --it is hard to predict and it is incredible that we are in the midst of a pandemic that is shaping so much, which is, I mean, how do you not address that though? Do you really believe that there is not a political cost to the deaths that we are seeing in this country? I mean, I look at Wisconsin where the President just had his rally, and the majority of likely Wisconsin voters tell us the response is going badly. Forty-nine percent of them say the Trump administration has hurt Wisconsin's effort. So, they think the President is hurting--\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, clearly, I mean--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --not helping.\u00a0REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, I-- I think it's going to be important for the President to remind everyone that it was he who shut down most travel from China. It was he who developed a task force. It was he that helped pass the-- the-- the CARES Act, at two trillion two weeks after the country was shut down.

            "article_content": "In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump declared that ordinary workers have seen a \"blue-collar boom\" during his tenure. That's partly true. But his suggestion that the bottom 50% of income-earners are faring better financially than the top 1% does not hold up to scrutiny.\u00a0 The average wealth of a worker making the median wage or less has risen by a total of $4,000 in the three years since Mr. Trump took office. The average wealth increase for those in the top 1%? That's up $2.2 million. Another claim from Mr. Trump in the State of the Union: Wages for lower paid workers have risen 16% since his election. That's true. But most of that increase owes to other factors, including a move by many states to hike their minimum wage. Mr. Trump's speech depicted the economy as firing on all cylinders, especially for working-class Americans. That description is off the mark for the manufacturing sector, historically a key source of employment for less-educated workers.\u00a0 After booming in 2018, manufacturers narrowly avoided a recession last year, hurt by Mr. Trump's trade fights with China and other countries. Since he entered office in 2017, the number of manufacturing jobs also has expanded more slowly than the broader labor market. The result: Manufacturers today account for a slightly smaller share of employment than they did in 2016. Those jobs are also paying less. A decade ago, the average manufacturing job paid $1 an hour more than jobs overall. Today, those same jobs tend to pays less that most other kinds of work, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mr. Trump is right to say the wealth of lower-income Americans is rising. And it's rising faster than under Barack Obama, when the wealth of the bottom half was essentially flat for the entirety of his two terms in office. But it's still not rising as fast as the wealth of the top 1%, who got a much bigger boost from Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts than average Americans did. When Mr. Trump was elected a little over three years ago, the top 1% had a collective net worth of $22.5 trillion. That's risen 21% to $27.3 trillion, according to the most recent\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0data. Meanwhile, the lower 40% of wage earners saw their combined net worth rise 12%, to $6.5 trillion from $5.8 trillion. But even that gain is smaller than it seems, said Gabriel Zucman, a University of California at Berkeley economist who is one of the leading researchers on wealth inequality. He said the net wealth of the bottom half of wage earners in America is actually close to zero because of debt, making any apparent increase appear larger than it really is.\u00a0 Average pay around the U.S. is rising faster today than when President Trump took office three years ago, though it is slower than its peak in February 2019, when hourly earnings grew 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. For lower-wage workers, the good news is they are capturing much of those gains after decades of muted wage growth. Since 2015, the lowest-paid quarter of workers has seen a higher percentage increase in pay than the top 25%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Some research has found that this increase is partly driven by states increasing their minimum wages. States that raised their minimum wage between 2013 and 2018 saw pay for their lowest-paid workers grow more than 50% faster than those that didn't, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The trend continued in 2019, said Elise Gould, senior economist at EPI. \"Year after year, we've seen states increase their minimum wage, either through indexing [for inflation] or legislation, and we have seen faster wage growth at the bottom in those states that have increased their minimum,\" she said. Nearly half of U.S. states and many cities are\u00a0boosting their minimum wage\u00a0this year. Meanwhile, the\u00a0federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 since 2009 \u2014 the longest stretch without a hike in baseline pay. The House of Representatives in July voted to\u00a0raise the minimum wage\u00a0to $15, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, and Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue. Mr. Trump likes to point to the stock market as a sign of the economy's health. He has done well on that account, presiding over a 43% increase in the S&P 500-stock index in the three years since his inauguration \u2014 better than George W. Bush for a similar period, but behind the blue-chip stock index's performance under both\u00a0Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Still, a hot stock market doesn't mean all workers are doing better. Richer Americans hold a far greater portion of the nation's   wealth, with the top 10% of income earners owning nearly 85% of the value of all stocks. \"People who own shares have definitely done well, but most middle-class workers, they can't afford to put away an appreciable amount for their retirement,\" said Paul Sonn, director of the National Employment Law Project Action Fund.\u00a0 Despite the modest economic growth, the longest expansion in U.S. history, which started in 2009, shows few signs of winding down 11 years later. Perhaps even more important, data suggest a broader swath of Americans are benefiting: More people have come off the sidelines and found jobs. As a result, the proportion of Americans in their prime working years (ages 25 through 54) who are employed is now higher than before the Great Recession. Another boon is that the moderate growth has meant that, at least so far, the economy isn't  showing evident signs of excess akin to the housing bubble that led to  the 2008 financial meltdown. \"This  expansion has been slow and steady, but it could run for a few more  years,\" Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics, told the Associated Press. \"There's no reason that it needs to die. Sometimes  slow and steady does win the race.\"",

            "article_content": "Hard to believe, but it's the final day of July, meaning presidential candidates and political parties were making their final pitches before the monthly filing period closed, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. In fundraising emails over the past couple of days, the Biden campaign was racing to raise $8 million more to close the month while the Trump campaign said it wanted to see $25 million more in donations before July came to an end. \u00a0 This comes after the Biden campaign and Democrats outraised the president and Republicans in the last two monthly filings for May and June. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee had its best online fundraising day and its third best online fundraising day ever Thursday. The online cash haul came in the same day that President Trump tweeted about delaying the election and former President Obama spoke at the funeral of John Lewis. \u00a0Committees are required to file with the Federal Election Commission by August 20. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden zeroed in on why he has mostly stayed mum on President Trump's election date change tweet on Thursday, stating the president was trying distract from the funeral of Rep. John Lewis. \"By the way, as these numbers have gotten worse, what did he do today,\" Biden asked the donors who joined him and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn virtually. \"He called for not having the election on November 3. He wants to postpone the election\u2026He doesn't want to focus on what's going on today with our buddy and your close friend, Jim, who you just buried.\"\u00a0 The fundraiser was also hosted by potential veep pick Rep. Karen Bass, who Clyburn urged Biden to consider,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \"Clearly Trump has dusted off the 'George Wallace for President' playbook and over the next few weeks we are going to see hatred and division like we haven't seen in a long time,\" Bass said last night. Friday evening he will be joined by another potential running mate: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, at a \"grassroots\" fundraiser. \u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP The Trump campaign has temporarily paused TV ad spending as it undergoes a \"review and fine-tuning of the campaign's strategy,\" according to a Trump campaign official.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0confirms the reevaluation under new campaign manager Bill Stepien does not extend to digital advertising. The Trump campaign has spent more than $84 million on television advertisements alone since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March, including a whopping $17.6 million in political battleground Florida and $10.4 million in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump promoted\u00a0Stepien\u00a0into the top job at the campaign, ousting Brad Parscale. After he was bumped up from political director to deputy campaign manager in late May, Stepien initiated a review of the operation's infrastructure and spending. NBC News first reported the television ad pause. So far, there's little indication of change in strategy. A\u00a0new digital ad\u00a0released Friday falsely claims opponent Joe Biden supports defunding of police. Biden has said he supports redirecting some police resources to address mental health or to change the prison system, but he told CBS News he\u00a0opposes defunding the police. \u00a0The ad also utilizes images of protests taking place under President Trump's leadership to make the argument that a Biden administration would not keep Americans safe. While the campaign may be reevaluating its ad strategy, Mr. Trump is still forging ahead, announcing by\u00a0tweet, \"We are doing a new ad campaign on Sleepy Joe Biden that will be out on Monday.\" A Trump campaign official told\u00a0CBS News, \"After the campaign reviewed ad strategy, we are going back up on the air with a focus on states that begin voting early. \u00a0The 2020 calendar is different from past years and there are many states where a majority of votes will be cast before election day. This is a smarter strategy.\" CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES FLORIDA INTERNET & TECHNOLOGY GAP CBS News is chronicling what has changed in the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. Less than a month out from schools restarting in districts across the country, COVID-19 has forced school administrators to incorporate distance learning in the upcoming semester. In this edition of CBS News COVID Chronicles,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0explored\u00a0how education leaders and local stakeholders are assessing the internet and technological gaps facing students who want to opt for remote learning but can't afford technology, or live outside of the range of internet connectivity.\u00a0 \"When they can't connect because they lack the technology, it instantly means they're not learning,\" said Whitney Johnson, a math teacher in Broward County. \"If I'm teaching a class and it's via Zoom, they're missing that instruction. If they have questions that they need to ask me but they don't have technology, they can't ask me those questions\u2026there's a complete disconnect.\"\u00a0 In Leon County in Tallahassee, South City Foundation partners with the local school district to ensure that the south side of town, a particularly vulnerable community, has the educational information and resources needed. \"This digital divide that we talk about, it spans rural and urban areas,\" said South City Foundation co-chair Loranne Ausley, a state representative whose district includes Leon County. Ausley noted that high-speed internet is a \"basic essential right\" in today's learning environment.\u00a0 \"It is something that families need not just for kids to access homework, but for families to access telehealth, to be able to work remotely, to be able to find out information about the health pandemic.\" Leon County Schools Superintendent Rocky Hannah said his team is tackling the digital divide by offering creative solutions like WiFi buses that were dispatched to low-income neighborhoods in the spring, to provide internet to students who didn't live near internet access points.\u00a0 His district has also spent $11 million to buy enough laptops for every student in the county. \"This may be the future of education\u2026but it's not the future if our kids don't have the devices, and they don't have access, and then they get left behind,\" said Hannah. \"And that's unacceptable.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER VOTE-BY-MAIL Top Democratic senators are demanding answers from the U.S. Postmaster General Louis Dejoy about reported changes to mail delivery, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Michigan Senator Gary Peters, Delaware Senator Tom Carper and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar wrote a\u00a0letter\u00a0to DeJoy raising concerns about changes, which they called \"questionable,\" especially as more Americans say they plan to vote by mail in November. \"Your failure to provide Congress with relevant information about these recent changes or to clarify to postal employees what changes you have directed as Postmaster General, undermines public trust and only increases concerns that service compromises will grow in advance of the election and peak mail volumes in November,\" the senators wrote. \u00a0 KEY CONSTITUENCIES HISPANIC VOTERS At an Arizona mask production site in May, President Trump thanked factory workers, GOP elected officials, and the owners of Sammy's Mexican Grill. \"I think most of us, all of us, all the Latinos are going to vote for you,\"\u00a0Jorge Rivas told the president. Now Rivas is lending his voice to Trump campaign ads that have blanketed the state, arguing in Spanish that the president's Democratic rival \"doesn't have the energy or capability to be the great leader this country needs.\" The spot is among\u00a0more than $400,000\u00a0in ads that have aired on Spanish-language TV channels in Arizona in recent weeks, according to Kantar/CMAG ad tracking data, outpacing spending in battleground states like Florida, which has nearly three times the number of Spanish speakers. Though Arizona awarded its 11 electoral votes to Donald Trump in 2016, Biden has tied or topped the president in nearly every recent poll here. If the former vice president were to win the Grand Canyon state, he'd be the first\u00a0Democrat in three decades\u00a0to do so. Much of Biden's lead comes from Hispanic voters, who comprise a third of Arizona residents. Sixty-nine percent support him in the\u00a0latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll. In 2016,\u00a061%\u00a0of Hispanic voters cast ballots for Hillary Clinton here. \"In 2016, we left too many young Latino votes on the table. In 2018, a lot of us put local investment here to turning out younger Latino voters and they did,\" said Congressman Ruben Gallego. Exit polls reported Hispanic or Latino voters cast 19% of all Arizona ballots cast in 2018,\u00a0up from 15% in 2016. The Phoenix-area Democrat serves on the Biden campaign's \"Latino leadership committee\" of surrogates attending virtual Zoom events and fundraisers. \"The fact that they are investing this much time and money and effort in Arizona this early is impressive,\" Gallego added.

YOUNG VOTERS Meme 2020 is working on a political campaign aimed at getting out the vote predominantly among Gen Z and Millennials leading up to the 2020 election, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The goal is to help give them the tools that they need to register to vote and cast their ballot come November. The effort is especially focused on informing people on how to vote by mail in their state given the coronavirus pandemic. \u00a0 \"Humor is a really amazing vessel to get someone to engage with content and also think about stuff that they might not want to think about on a daily basis like voting or politics, especially given today's state,\" said Meme 2020 chief of staff Ryan Patrick Kelley of their approach. \"The goal is to engage and then direct them to the website to get them all the information that they need, starting with how to vote by mail.\"\u00a0 Meme 2020 is partnering with names like @MyTherapistSays which has 5.5 million followers on Instagram, @TankSinatra with its 2.6 million followers on IG and @Betches with its 7 million followers. It's now also teaming up with the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, which has attracted attention for some of its more traditional ads that have gone viral, and others, like Rhyme Combinator, including on an animation project released Friday on YouTube. The campaign financing comes through tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman. This week, Meme 2020 also filed paperwork for the creation of a super PAC called Meme America PAC. LISTEN UP \"THE TAKEOUT\" Senator Ron Wyden slammed President Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying the president \"will go down in history for turning a public health crisis into a culture war.\" Wyden added, \"What a mess Donald Trump has made of coronavirus policy.\" The Oregon Democrat made the comments in an interview with\u00a0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\u00a0for this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"Donald Trump will go down in history as turning a public health crisis into a culture war. I just believe that's led to the needless deaths of so many of our friends and neighbors.\"\u00a0You can listen to the full podcast here. STATE-BY-STATE OHIO The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of Ohio and the Lawyers' Committee are suing the state of Ohio over its system of matching signatures on absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications. The federal lawsuit was filed as more voters are turning to vote-by-mail as the COVID-19 pandemic continues across the nation, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Alora Thomas, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said in a statement that county election officials may not be equipped to assess matching signatures and ballots, and therefore could toss out ballots. \"Ohioans' fundamental right to vote is at risk here, and state officials can and should fix this broken system immediately, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she said. \u00a0\u00a0 PENNSYLVANIA Pennsylvania will pay the postage for mail-in ballots in the November election, Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar announced Friday. The state's move to provide every county with funds to pay for prepaid postage comes after over 1.5 million Pennsylvanians voted by mail in a June primary, about 15 times the number in the 2016 general.\u00a0 \"Our goal is to make voting as accessible, safe, and easy for eligible voters as possible,\" Boockvar said in a statement. \"Mail-in or absentee voting with prepaid postage means Pennsylvanians can vote from the comfort of their own home, without having to make a trip to the post office to buy a stamp, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says this is the first year all Pennsylvania voters are eligible to send their ballots through the mail, following bipartisan legislation in the fall.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "As of this writing,\u00a0CBS News has projected\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden will win Wisconsin. He is ahead there by 20,000 votes, ironically roughly the same margin Hillary Clinton lost the state by in 2016, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. The Trump campaign has called for a recount in the state. Wisconsin officials are well practiced in recounts - Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein paid for a recount in 2016, with no discernable change in vote totals. In Michigan\u00a0CBS News projects Biden is the winner. The last piece of the Blue Wall and Biden's home state of Pennsylvania is also in the air. While President Trump currently has a commanding lead +6 points over Biden, more than a million votes have not been counted and most of those are going to come from deep blue Philadelphia, and offices there have said not expect those results today. In Georgia, the president leads Biden by roughly 83,000 votes. However, like Pennsylvania, the outstanding ballots are from the mail and a Democratic stronghold metro area: Fulton County (Atlanta). Mail ballots throughout the country have been cast by more Democrats than Republicans, according to\u00a0Korte. The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Michigan and Pennsylvania, seeking to stop ballot counting in the battleground states, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. These efforts are part of an ongoing strategy from the Trump campaign to litigate their way to an Electoral College victory. Biden leads in Nevada but by less than a point with plenty of ballots remaining. Originally, officials said they would not report results again until tomorrow, but they changed their mind midday, saying that high interest pushed them to report results this evening. The situation is similar in Arizona, however Biden has a slightly larger lead of nearly 2.5 points. More than a quarter million Maricopa County mail ballots were still uncounted early Wednesday. Finally, in North Carolina where results are favoring Donald Trump by less than 1.5 points. Because mail ballots postmarked by Election Day can be accepted if they're received by Nov. 13 in the state, reports currently indicate that results for those still to come will not be reported until they're all in next week. So what's the bottom line? It's possible that we will know the projected winner as early as this evening. However, we will not have final results in every state for some time - as is normal. A little less normal: The potential for multiplying sets of lawsuits as days go by. After a very late election night, a confident and hopeful Biden addressed the waiting nation about how he views election results like these still being tabulated. \"It's clear that we are winning enough states to reach 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency,\" Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, with running mate Sen. Kamala Harris by his side. Biden added, \"I am not here to declare that we won. But I am here to report, that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.\" After his speech, Biden declined to answer how he will respond to the battleground lawsuits currently being filed by the Trump campaign when asked by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson.\u00a0But his campaign is preparing for potential legal wars: they arranged a special fundraising site on Wednesday -- called \"Biden Fight Fund\" -- to garner extra cash to ensure all votes are counted and argue in court for their causes. During a briefing on Wednesday, campaign senior adviser Bob Bauer, the head of the voter protection effort, said if Mr. Trump goes to the high court \"he will be in for one of the most embarrassing defeats a president has ever suffered.\" President Trump took to Twitter Wednesday to vent about the ongoing vote count, falsely claiming that his lead in Democratic-run states \"started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted.\"\u00a0Sganga\u00a0reports Twitter flagged the tweets as \"misleading,\" given those votes were cast legally and returned before state deadlines. Mr. Trump continued tweeting this evening saying, \"Our lawyers have asked for ;meaningful access', but what good does that do? The damage has already been done to the integrity of our system, and to the Presidential Election itself. This is what should be discussed!\" The president's son Eric Trump, Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Former Mayor Rudy Guiliani spoke at a news conference in Philadelphia, Wednesday. The president's youngest son alleged voter fraud in Pennsylvania, though officials have found no evidence. \"We're going to win Pennsylvania but they're trying to cheat us out of it because they know it is their only path to victory,\" the younger Trump said. CBS News has learned Vice President Pence, White House advisor Jared Kushner and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows met at the Trump campaign's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, on Wednesday to discuss the campaign's path forward. These Senate results are a good reminder - money isn't everything. Democrats had high hopes of flipping the Senate and spent record money in their efforts to do so, but with Senate control still in the air, based on the\u00a0CBS News projections for Republicans so far, losing Democratic Senate campaigns had spent at least $140 million more in nine races through October 14, only to come up short. That's according to the latest pre-general election FEC filings says\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. Those races include some candidates who raised record breaking sums such as Jaime Harrison in South Carolina who outspent Senator Lindsey Graham by roughly $40 million; Theresa Greenfield in Iowa who outspent Senator Joni Ernst by at least $21 million, and Amy McGrath in Kentucky whose campaign outspent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's by nearly $30 million through October 14. It also includes the Maine Senate race where Democrat Sara Gideon congratulated GOP Senator Susan Collins Wednesday on her win after outspending Collins in the race about two-to-one. Other Democrats who invested more only to come up short include Barbara Bollier in Kansas, Steve Bullock in Montana and MJ Hager in Texas. Additionally,\u00a0CBS News projected Republican Tommy Tuberville\u00a0would unseat Democratic Senator Doug Jones, despite being outspent by Jones more than four-to-one. That $140 million more spent on losing races could continue to grow as there are still a number of Senate races which\u00a0CBS News has not made projections\u00a0in yet including in North Carolina, Michigan, two races in Georgia, and in Republican leaning Alaska. Meanwhile, there are at least two Senate races where the money may have paid off for Democrats to some extent. In Colorado,\u00a0CBS News projected John Hickenlooper will unseat Senator Cory Gardner\u00a0who he outspent him by more than $10 million. And in Arizona, where the race is likely Democrat, Mark Kelly outspent Martha McSally by roughly $30 million. While at the end of the day, it all comes down to who gets the votes, heading into the election, Democrats did warn not to discount spending by outside groups. According to those pre-general election filing, the Senate Leadership Fund which helps Republicans invested more than $240 million this year alone. At the same time, Democrats' Senate Majority PAC reported more than $220 million in disbursements in 2020 as well. A pro-Trump group says they are planning a protest outside the facility where elections officials are counting ballots in Arizona's most populous county, after \"hundreds of voter complaints\" over Maricopa County encouraging voters to use Sharpies at the polls, which supporters fear invalidated their ballots, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Arizona's Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican,\u00a0also sent a letter\u00a0to county elections staff demanding details over the issue. Officials in the battleground state insist Sharpies were not only allowed but encouraged at polling sites, given they are less likely to smudge on ballots than pens. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, suggested the mix-up likely stemmed from voters merely misunderstanding how their vote\u00a0was tracked online. With 96% of the expected votes in,\u00a0CBS News has projected President Donald Trump as the winner in Florida.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that as of this writing, the president is leading former Vice President Biden by 3 points in the state -- two points more than he won the state by in 2016. Early analyses show that while the president actually lost a county that he'd won in 2016 (Duval County), part of his overall state victory was due to his ability to cut into Biden's margins in Democratic-leaning Miami-Dade County. In 2016, Trump lost the county by 290,000 votes. With 96% of votes in, he's cut his margin of loss down to 84,792 votes. During a press conference Tuesday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis praised the work of election officials while seemingly criticizing other states. \"Perhaps 2020 was the year that we finally vanquished the ghost of Bush versus Gore,\" said DeSantis. \"As we watch what unfolds in the rest of the country, I do think you're going to continue to hear from people...if the third most populous state in the country can count 11 million votes, produce a result across the board, why can't some of these other states that are much smaller? And that's something that we're going to be watching.\" In a neighboring battleground state,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Georgia is still counting votes. In a statement Wednesday evening, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his team was working with the counties to get all of the state's election results counted by Wednesday night or Thursday morning. Raffensperger reported that were approximately 200,000 outstanding absentee ballots to be counted throughout the state. With 94% of the expected votes in, President Trump is leading Biden by a narrow margin of 68,315 votes. Progressive groups on the ground in the state tell\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0that they are still hopeful and that it's crucial that every vote is counted. Mr. Trump is projected to win Iowa's 6 electoral votes and incumbent Republican Senator Joni Ernst is also projected to serve another six years in the Senate. In Iowa's first congressional district, Republican challenger Ashley Hinson unseats Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer. In 2018, Finkenauer became the second youngest member of Congress, but is now out after serving one term. While Hinson declared victory late last night,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports Finkenauer conceded early this afternoon. Senator Joni Ernst also gave a victory speech in Des Moines last night after getting a concession call from the Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield. The race in the second district for an open seat is still unsettled between Democrat Rita Hart and Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks. In the third district, the Republican challenger David Young conceded to incumbent Democrat Cindy Axne last night. Meanwhile over in the fourth district, a reliably red area, Republican Randy Feenstra easily defeated Democrat J.D. Scholten. That seat is currently held by Rep. Steve King but during the primary, Feenstra defeated King to become the Republican nominee. CBS News projects Biden is the presumptive winner in Michigan. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster,President Trump's campaign filed a lawsuit in a Michigan state court on Thursday asking for a judge to \"mandate\" that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson \"order all counting and processing of absentee votes cease immediately until an election inspector from each party is present at each absent voter counting board and mandate that Secretary Benson order the immediate segregation of all ballots that are not being inspected and monitored as required under law.\" Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement, \" President Trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations.\" In a\u00a0tweet, Benson said, \"we are not going to let any campaign, candidate, or political party stop our work to ensure every voice is heard.\" Results are continuing to flow in Wednesday from Nevada, after state elections officials\u00a0initially said\u00a0they did not plan to release more results until Thursday. Nevada has posted record turnout so far, with nearly 1.2 million votes tallied overnight in the state, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. All in-person early votes, Election Day votes, and mail ballots received through November 2nd in the state had already been reported. But an unknown number of mail ballots could still be outstanding in Nevada, given the state mailed ballots to all active voters due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as long as they are received within seven days and are postmarked by Election Day. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that in a press conference Wednesday afternoon, North Carolina State Board of Elections Director Karen Brinson Bell said that with very few exceptions, North Carolina's election results will not be updated before November 12 -- that's the date that most county boards of elections will hold meetings to review absentee by mail ballots before they're counted. Additionally, Bell told reporters that there are approximately 117,000 absentee by mail ballots that were requested by voters, who the state board does not have a ballot for just yet. In North Carolina, voters had until 5pm on Election Day to get their absentee mail ballots postmarked and sent. As long as a ballot that was properly postmarked and completed is received by November 13, it will be counted. With 95% of the votes in,\u00a0CBS News shows Mr. Trump leading\u00a0in the state by 76,000 votes. He won the state by more than double that amount in 2016, garnering 173,315 more votes than Hillary Clinton. As the day after the election comes to a close, Pennsylvania still doesn't have a winner, a scenario we've known to be possible since the state's June primary because of a massive influx of voting by mail ballots, which take much longer to count than in-person ones. \"If it's close, I think we're likely to see this phenomenon where what's counted on November 3 is red, and there's considerable uncertainty about what's left to be counted with the likelihood that what's left to be counted is blue,\" OSU Law School Professor Ed Foley, who coined the term \"blue shift,\"\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0in June. President Donald Trump led by over 260,000 votes, or 4.4 points late this evening. But over a million ballots are expected to be counted in the coming days. The majority of those uncounted ballots are mail ballots, which, are likely to lean sharply toward Biden since twice as many Democrats as Republicans requested them. Additionally, Pennsylvania will\u00a0accept\u00a0mail ballots by mail for three more days so long as they aren't postmarked after Election Day, unless the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0decides otherwise. The state GOP has already\u00a0appealed\u00a0to the high court, and a GOP congressional candidate unsuccessfully asked a federal district to weigh in and appealed to the Third Circuit. Disputes over Pennsylvania's handling of the election are also playing out in state and federal court. The Trump campaign has appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court after a Bucks County judge denied a request for the county not to count mail ballots that it allowed voters to correct. The campaign alleged that the county violated the state Election Code by inspecting the outside of those ballots' envelopes for flaws ahead of Nov. 3. The Trump campaign has appealed the denial of a petition filed Tuesday in Philadelphia to allow poll watchers to more closely observe counting. The Commonwealth Court filing on Wednesday simply gives notice the campaign is appealing. The presiding election day judge in Philly wrote Tuesday that testimony of the campaign's witness, a poll watcher, was that the couldn't observe writing on the outside of ballots. \"Given that observers are directed only to observe and not audit ballots, we conclude...that the Board of Elections has complied with the observation requirements,\" she wrote. The DNC has filed to intervene in another two lawsuits over flawed mail ballot remedies. In that one, Representative Mike Kelly, a GOP Pennsylvania House candidate, and four other Pennsylvanians have filed a lawsuit in the asking the Commonwealth Court to prevent counties from allowing voters whose mail ballots have been rejected for a defect to cast a provisional ballot in person. The lawsuit argues that the state Supreme Court has already ruled that such a remedy doesn't exist, while the earlier ballot curing lawsuit in Montgomery County's Common Pleas court made a 14th Amendment argument. State election officials issued guidance to counties two weeks ago saying voters who had a mail or absentee ballot rejected can still vote in person with on a provisional ballot, as you would if you'd use if you applied for a mail ballot but didn't use it. Eight counties - Blair, Berks, Carbon, Clinton, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lycoming and Perry - have refused to follow the guidance, the lawsuit says. CBS News projects Biden is the presumptive winner in Wisconsin. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, Biden won one of the states that Democrats have been hoping to reclaim since Mr. Trump won the Badger state in 2016. Biden was helped by absentee ballot returns that favored him and a strong showing in liberal Dane County, home to Madison, where his margin of victory over Mr. Trump was about 35,000 votes greater than Hillary Clinton's win in the county four years ago. The Trump campaign says it is filing for a recount in the state. IN THE SENATE The Democrats' chances of flipping the Senate are growing thinner as several of the targeted Republican incumbents won re-election including Senators Susan Collins in Maine, Steve Daines in Montana, and Joni Ernst in Iowa. Democratic Senator Doug Jones lost in Alabama to Republican Tommy Tuberville, which is a Republican pick up.\u00a0CBS News has projected Governor John Hickenlooper beat Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado\u00a0which is a Democratic pick up.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0says there are still several battleground races that have yet to be called including Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and the two Georgia Senate races. To win control, the Democrats would have to protect Senator Gary Peters in Michigan and winning three more seats if Biden wins the White House and four more if Mr. Trump is reelected. Overall, House Republicans are feeling ecstatic after surpassing expectations last night reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Republicans have flipped at least seven seats held by the moderate Democrat class that gave them the majority in 2018. Democrats are still likely to hold their majority, as Republicans needed to net 17 seats and have only seen a net gain of five so far after Democrats won two redistricted seats in North Carolina. Incumbents like Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico's 2nd or Colin Peterson in Minnesota's 7th were expected to have tight paths to reelection, but others like Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida's 26th or Donna Shalala in Florida's 27th were surprise losses for the caucus. The\u00a0latest flip as of Wednesday afternoon is Iowa's 1st, where Republican Ashley Hinson unseated Democrat Abby Finkenauer. Tuesday's performance defies expectations set by House strategists on both sides, after Democrats expanded their offensive battlefield and targeted many Republican incumbents seen as vulnerable. Of the 51\u00a0targeted seats by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Democrats are on track to win one so far: Georgia's 7th, where Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux's campaign is confident they can hold onto their lead even if the remaining absentee ballot count goes Republican. While the nation awaits a final call for the presidency, all 11 gubernatorial races were able to be called by Wednesday morning. Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte's win over Democrat Lieutenant Governor Mike Cooney in Montana is the only flip, as Republicans now hold the governor's chair in 27 seats. Democratic Governor Roy Cooper was able to hold on for reelection in North Carolina, as well as was Missouri Republican Governor Mike Parson. In regard to state legislatures, an especially important down ballot category this year with redistricting on the horizon,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says Democrats have severely underperformed. Republicans were able to claim victory in heavily targeted chambers by Democrats in Florida, North Carolina and Texas - all states that are expected to add congressional seats. While Democrats could still flip state chambers in Arizona, Republicans have countered any losses by flipping the New Hampshire state legislature. In a call with reporters, Republican State Leadership Committee President Austin Chambers praised Republican candidates for keeping their elections to local issues, while hitting Democrats for trying to nationalize them. \"We're batting a thousand. We have won everything we set out to win, we've won in very challenging places,\" he said, adding that Democratic outside groups \"spent over half a billion dollars across the country in these races. And they don't have a damn thing to show for it at this point.\"",

            "article_content": "Does ad spending matter? Mike Bloomberg announced Wednesday he was exiting the 2020 Democratic presidential race after launching an unorthodox bid for the White House in November and\u00a0spending\u00a0a record amount of cash in that short time. He skipped the first four primary states but then put more than $570 million into advertising across the country according to ad tracking by Kantar/Campaign Media analysis group. At the time of his departure from the race the morning after Super Tuesday, he had amassed just 31 pledged delegates, meaning in total he had spent about $18 million per delegate earned according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. At the same time, only about $237 million of that total ad spending has been on ads targeting Super Tuesday state voters who headed to the polls March 3. The vast bulk of it had been spent in states that had not even voted by the time of his exit, including in Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio. In Florida, Bloomberg spent nearly $48 million on ads. He also doled out more than $17 million in Ohio. Both battleground states hold presidential primaries\u00a0on March 17.\u00a0In New York, Bloomberg's home state, he spent more than $26 million. In Pennsylvania, he spent $23 million. Neither state has voted yet \u2014 their primaries will be held\u00a0on April 28, more than a month away.\u00a0 By comparison, Joe Biden, who won the most states on Super Tuesday, spent just over $2 million in total on television, radio and digital advertisements in those 14 states. JOE BIDEN After the endorsement of Mike Bloomberg, a beaming Joe Biden strolled into a Los Angeles hotel conference room to talk about his surprising wins last night across the country and invite people into the \"movement\" his campaign is building. While Biden did not mention Bernie Sanders by name,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0says he responded to Sanders' attacks ads against him.\u00a0 \"What we can't let happen is let this primary turn into negative attacks,\" Biden said, adding if it does then President Trump will win re-election. Asked by a reporter about Sanders' claim that the Democratic \"establishment\" is trying to defeat him, Biden smiled and\u00a0said, \"The establishment are all those hardworking, middle class people, those African-Americans...they are the establishment!\" These are the voters exit polls show he won on Super Tuesday.\u00a0 Later this evening, Biden is attending a fundraiser in Los Angeles.\u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte reports that after a Super Tuesday that Bernie Sanders had hoped would showcase his dominance but instead established Joe Biden's dramatic comeback, the Vermont senator said, \"Of course I'm disappointed,\" but also noted he had won the primaries in his home state of Vermont, Utah, Colorado and likely California. \u00a0 \"Now, I haven't seen the latest delegate count, but my guess is that after California is thrown into the hopper, it's gonna be pretty close. We may be up by a few. Biden may be up by a few. But I think we go forward, basically neck and neck,\" said Sanders, voicing confidence in his standing. By 4 p.m. Wednesday, Biden had 494 delegates to Sanders' 425 and had won 10 out of the 14 states that voted Tuesday, according to CBS News' calculations. Sanders sought to remind reporters at his field office in Burlington that he was exceeding expectations. \"If everybody here thought that a year would come and go, and we would be either tied for first \u2014 a few votes up, a few votes down, delegates up or down \u2014 that is a pretty amazing achievement,\" he added. Sanders admitted some pitfalls, including the fact that young voters, essential to his political revolution, have yet to show up in the numbers he was hoping to see. \"This is a campaign which is trying to bring, and it is not easy,\" he said. People who have not been involved in the political process so if you might want to ask me, maybe as a follow-up question, 'have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?' And the answer is no. We're making some progress, but historically, everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in.\" He expressed hope that this would not be the case after the primary process was settled, but his disappointment in the turnout of young voters was palpable. \"I think that will change in the general election, but I am honest \u2014 be honest with you,\" he said. \"We have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process. It is not easy.\" ... He also told reporters that he had spoken on the phone a few hours earler with Elizabeth Warren, who failed to win any states on Tuesday, including her home state of Massachusetts, where she placed third.\u00a0 \"What Senator Warren told me is that she is assessing her campaign,\" he said. \"She has not made any decisions as of this point. And it is important, I think for all of us, certainly me, who known Elizabeth Warren for many, many years, to respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision.\" Warren's departure from the race would likely help Sanders' standing in the races ahead. He's hoping to do well in Michigan, where he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Should he win, it would solidify his argument that he can build a coalition of urban and working-class voters. A loss would imply he is losing support, especially after failing to win Minnesota and Massachusetts. \"We are going in there with a full expectation and the hope that we will win,\" he said, calling it an \"enormously important state\" and one \"I feel very comfortable in.\" Trade is one issue he expects to bring up in Michigan. Although he is trying to emphasize his distance from the former vice president, Sanders is trying to highlight his own relationship with the president he served, Barack Obama. Sanders released an ad Wednesday morning featuring President Obama's praise of Sanders on some issues. Asked by CBS News what he hoped to achieve with that message, Sanders responded that though the two are not \"best friends,\" he and Mr. Obama talk every so often. Sanders said that he wanted to combat \"dishonest statements about my relationship with Obama, to say that I worked with him and respect him and look forward to working with him.\" Read more here. ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren is\u00a0assessing\u00a0the future of her campaign after disappointing losses in\u00a0Super Tuesday\u00a0states, including a third-place finish in her home state of Massachusetts. Warren \"is talking to her team to assess the path forward,\" an aide to the Massachusetts senator told\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Speaking to supporters on Tuesday evening, Warren indicated that she did not plan to drop out of the race. \"My name is Elizabeth Warren, and I'm the woman who's going to beat Donald Trump,\" Warren said as she took the stage in Detroit. She urged voters not to listen to prognostications from pundits, but instead to vote with their hearts.\u00a0 \"Prediction has been a terrible business, and the pundits have gotten it wrong over and over,\" Warren said. In a memo to staff, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau said that the team was \"disappointed in the results.\" Lau said in the memo, \"Last night, we fell well short of viability goals and projections, and we are disappointed in the results. We're still waiting for more results to come in to get a better sense of the final delegate math. And we also all know the race has been extremely volatile in recent weeks and days with frontrunners changing at a pretty rapid pace.\" He added, \"But we are obviously disappointed.\" Sanders told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he had spoken to Warren on the phone, and that she was assessing her campaign. He said it was important to \"respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision.\" CBSNews.com political reporter Grace Segers\u00a0says the Democratic field appeared to narrow to a two-man race, after Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders each won several of the 14 states up for grabs on Tuesday.\u00a0Mike Bloomberg, who only won American Samoa, announced Wednesday morning that he is dropping out of the race and endorsing Biden. In the run-up to Super Tuesday, Biden's candidacy gathered strength from the endorsements of former opponents Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, indicating a consolidation of the party's moderate wing behind the former vice president. Biden picked up wins in Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas, according to CBS News projections, while Sanders won in Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont. Sanders is also currently leading in California. *CBSN Political Reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns\u00a0contributed to this report\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG After three months and over $500 million of his own personal money spent, Mike Bloomberg\u00a0ended\u00a0his presidential campaign.\u00a0 Speaking to members of his staff and some supporters, Bloomberg delivered one of his most emotional speeches since entering the race in November last year according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. \"Today I am clear-eyed about our overriding objective. And that is victory in November. Not a victory for me our campaign, but victory for our country.\"\u00a0 Bloomberg said and added, \u00a0\"If you remember, I entered the race for president to defeat Donald Trump. And today, I am leaving the race for the same reason, to defeat Donald Trump because staying in would make it more difficult to achieve that goal.\"\u00a0 Bloomberg threw his endorsement to Joe Biden. He called Biden a friend, and someone he has worked extensively with on issues that they both care about. \"I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. And after yesterday's vote, it's clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.\"\u00a0 He also spoke about the odds he says his campaign was up against when he entered the race. He said \"I knew we didn't have much of a chance, but we did it anyway.\" Bloomberg has vowed to hand over some of his enormous campaign infrastructure to the eventual Democratic nominee. CALIFORNIA The California primary currently leans towards Bernie Sanders. As of Wednesday afternoon,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Alex Tin\u00a0report Sanders has 33.6% of the vote followed by Joe Biden at 24.9%. Delegates in California are awarded at both the state level and in each of the 53 congressional districts. A candidate needs to reach a 15% threshold statewide to get a share of the 144 delegates while another 271 are awarded by reaching the same threshold in the congressional districts. Sanders and Biden are the only candidates currently reaching the 15% statewide viability threshold, while Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg reach that threshold in certain congressional districts. The current delegate allocation shows Sanders winning 150, Biden 99, Bloomberg 9, and Warren 1. With votes still being tabulated, these numbers will continue to change over the next several days. Last night at some polling locations, Californians braved long wait times. Issues with new machinery in Los Angeles County contributed to some of the long wait times, some in excess of three hours, with multiple poll workers complaining to CBS News of paper jams and some user confusion. Even Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, when casting his ballot at a Southern California elementary school Tuesday morning, appeared to mistake one step of the process. Workers were given little opportunity for breaks, some working continuously from 6 a.m. Tuesday through midnight. As in every election, multiple locations also dealt with volunteers not showing up or abandoning their posts. However, both poll workers and voters complained of broader issues. A tedious registration step which requires many voters to either same-day register, request a Democratic party ballot, or to have registered within the last month caused some delays. There were delays when they didn't show up as having been processed in the voter rolls, causing bottle-necks where voters were waiting to check in, while plenty of ballot stations were free.\u00a0 The tablets provided for check-in occasionally crashed or lagged during the day, contributing to frustrations. Some Californians also faced poor load balancing, where an influx of voters seeking to cast their ballots at the last minute \u2014 as opposed to over the weeks-long early voting period \u2014 were unaware of nearby locations with shorter lines. The problem worsened as polling stations neared closing time, with some voters unwilling to risk abandoning their spot in line at one location in order to race to a nearby site.\u00a0 Multiple campaign observers reported seeing dozens of voters flee the long lines at their locations, and sought to encourage voters to stay or seek alternatives. Shortly before the polls closed, the Sanders campaign filed a complaint to keep polling locations in Los Angeles County open for an extra two hours. \"After hearing reporters of voters facing 4-hour lines, the Bernie Sanders campaign has filed a complaint to prevent polling locations from closing at 8 p.m., to ensure that Angelenos can exercise their constitutional right to vote,\" Sanders spokesperson Anna Bahr tweeted.\u00a0 At a press conference Tuesday night, L.A. County Registrar Dean Logan said the county had decided not to expand polling hours and apologized to voters who had waited in long lines.\u00a0 \"I think that to have extended the hours would have just extended the lines, perhaps, and really wouldn't have addressed the core issues,\" Logan said. Late-night polls across Southern California were also flooded with donated pizza and refreshments, mostly from anonymous donors. At a site in UCLA's student union, were some voters reported some of the county's longest waits, students flocked to hand out everything from leftover chicken wings to mountains of Oreos for their peers and faculty waiting in line, as stand-up comedians sought to elicit some laughs from the crowd that snaked across several rooms and out the building at one point. California's counties have until next month to officially complete their vote count, as they tabulate and fold in ballots from the polling stations and vote-by-mail. NORTH CAROLINA As voting precincts began to close in North Carolina Tuesday evening, CBS News exit polling data showed that Joe Biden would win the state's primary contest. With 42% of North Carolina Democratic primary voters choosing him as their pick, the former vice president would also dominate among black voters garnering more than 60% of their vote.\u00a0 During a Biden Super Tuesday election night party,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0spoke with voters who were initially doubtful of Biden's prospects as the Democratic nominee but have since had a change of heart.\u00a0 \"I've liked Biden\u2026but I was concerned and just found out tonight, that the stutter is not age-related but it's actually something he's had all his life,\" said Carol Canfield who voted early for former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and said his endorsement helped solidify her decision to donate to Biden's campaign. \"I feel better knowing that it's not all age related\u2014that stutter\u2014because my concern has been all along, when he gets up next to [Trump]\u2026he's gonna start making fun of him like he's in seventh grade.\"\u00a0 Sandra Cummings, 68, voted early in North Carolina and while she wouldn't say who she voted for she admitted that if she hadn't voted early, she probably would've voted differently after seeing the results from the South Carolina Democratic primary contest where Biden won with almost half the vote. \"I've always liked Biden\u2026but unfortunately I didn't think at the time that he was going to move forward,\" said Cummings. \"I don't think Bernie can unite people, so I never was for Bernie.\"\u00a0 CBS News exit polls showed that 31% of North Carolina voters said the most important candidate quality is someone who can unite the country. Andrew Taylor, who has been a registered Republican for over 50 years told CBS News Tuesday that in the general election he plans to vote for whomever the Democratic nominee is and would choose Biden over Sanders because he's looking for a candidate who can help Democrats to take control of the Senate.\u00a0 \"I don't want any Republicans in any office. They can't be trusted. They've lost the party and I'll vote Democratic in the finals,\" said Taylor. \"I'll vote against Trump in any election. Anybody but Trump.\" Separately in North Carolina, after courts ruled that the state's congressional districts were politically gerrymandered \"with surgical precision,\" North Carolina's map was redrawn to even the playing field. North Carolina's 2nd and 6th Districts now include areas that favor Democrats more and two women, Deborah Ross and Kathy Manning, won the Democratic nods.\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee immediately touted what will very likely be two new additions to their caucus, and DCCC spokesperson Robyn Patterson said, \"Our gains tonight will make it even harder for Republican leadership to convince anyone the House is in play.\"\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says the gubernatorial matchup in the state is also set, with incumbent Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, facing Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest in November. Forest captured almost 90 percent of the Republican vote, but has a decent fundraising gap to cover as Cooper has close to $9 million cash on hand, while Forest has just under $1 million.\u00a0 IN THE SENATE There were three Senate primaries of interest on Super Tuesday, and two of the three have advanced to a runoff. The top two candidates in the Republican primary in Alabama will head to a runoff on March 31 and the top two Democratic primary in Texas will have runoff on May 26, reports\u00a0CBS News political associate producer Eleanor Watson. In North Carolina, veteran Cal Cunningham defeated Erica Smith in the Democratic primary and will go on to face Republican Senator Thom Tillis in the general election in November.\u00a0 Former attorney general Jeff Sessions and former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville will compete in the runoff. Sessions is trying to win his former seat in a state that President Trump, who fired him as attorney general, won by almost 30 points in 2016. Trump's comments in the race have largely targeted Roy Moore, the former sheriff who lost the 2017 special election to Doug Jones, a Democrat. But he also mocked his former attorney general's inability to win the primary outright in a tweet Wednesday. \"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote. In the primary on Tuesday, Moore won about 7% of the vote, eliminating him from a runoff. Tuberville won 33% of the vote, and Sessions won 31.6%. Congressman Bradley Byrne fell behind at 25.2%. Since no candidate reached the 50% threshold, the top two, Tuberville and Byrne, will compete in a runoff at the end of the month.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports former Air Force pilot M.J. Hegar advanced to a runoff in the crowded Democratic Senate primary in Texas. None of the candidates crossed the 50% threshold, so there will be a runoff election in May to determine which Democratic nominee will challenge Republican incumbent John Cornyn in November. With 86% of precincts reporting, Hegar is leading with 22.1% of the vote. Hegar, who lost a congressional race in Texas in 2018, has been endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She was leading the counties that encompass Austin and Houston and many others in eastern central Texas. Trailing Hegar are longtime Texas State Senator Royce West with 14.4% of the vote and progressive organizer Cristina Tzintzun Ramirez, who received an endorsement from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with 13.2% of the vote. West has represented Dallas in the Texas Senate since 1993 and received about a third of his votes from Dallas County. Tzintzun Ramirez performed well in San Antonio, El Paso and parts of the Rio Grande Valley. IN THE HOUSE There were more than 100 Congressional districts that had primaries last night, and most of the key ones to watch ended with the status quo winner. The Democrat primary Texas' 28th District had a tight finish, with incumbent Democrat Henry Cuellar fending off the challenge from upstart progressive Jessica Cisneros. The gap between the two was about 4%, a much smaller margin than Cuellar has had in his 15-year career in Congress. In a press conference in Laredo today,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that Cisneros left a voicemail conceding to Cuellar this morning.\u00a0 \"Obviously the establishment machine and corporate money on the other side fought back for the incumbent this time,\" she said at the presser. \"I think if anything, what what he should have gotten from last night's results is that there's so many people that agree with the vision that this campaign has, and I'm hoping that he's really willing to reach out to those folks and listen to us.\"\u00a0 Another incumbent with a primary challenger, Republican Kay Granger of Texas' 12th, handily won against Chris Putnam. It's notable that Granger is the only current GOP woman serving in the Texas delegation, which is part of the larger trend of record lows of Republican House Congresswomen. The Republican campaign House arm has been touting their number of recruits to fix this, and saw some wins with Genevieve Collins in Texas' 32nd and Beth Van Duyne in Texas' 24th. Both are in suburban districts that'll be competitive come November.\u00a0 In Texas' 22nd, the grandson of the late George H.W. Bush, Pierce Bush, was blocked out of moving on to the Republican runoff. Instead, Troy Nehls and Kathaleen Wall will face off in May for Congressman Pete Olson's old seat. While votes out west in California will be counted in full over the coming days, some matchups are set.\u00a0 Two freshmen House Democrats, T.J. Cox of California's 21st and Gil Cisneros of California's 39th, will have rematches with their 2018 Republican opponents. Cox will face former Representative David Valadao, while Cisneros will face Young Kim.\u00a0 The battle for Katie Hill's old seat is also wrapping up, as Democrat assemblywoman Christy Smith will likely see Republican veteran Mike Garcia in the special election general on May 12.\u00a0 In San Diego, the race for Duncan Hunter's seat is still too close to call, but right now former Representative Darrell Issa is ahead of conservative talk show host Carl Demaio. Whoever wins between the two will occupy the second slot in the jungle primary to Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who was the district's Democrat nominee in 2018. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "As the U.S. coronavirus death toll approaches 200,000, the topic of health care takes center stage ahead of Election Day.\u00a0Federal data released Tuesday\u00a0reveals nearly 30 million people in the United States lacked health insurance in 2019, prior to the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump again this week vowed to release a proposal to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. \"I have it all ready. I have it all ready,\" Mr. Trump told ABC News on Tuesday during a Town Hall. Since running for president in 2015, President Trump has promised to bring forth a \"terrific\" and \"phenomenal\" new health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, but has yet to deliver. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters on Wednesday the president would be rolling out an executive order on health care before Election Day, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh doubled down on the president's expressed commitment to replace Obamacare on CNN on Wednesday night. \"Of course it's real,\" Murtaugh said. The senior campaign official offered no further details, adding, \"I'm not going to get ahead of the White House and their plans for the announcement.\" But top health care officials in the Trump administration testifying before Congress on Wednesday said they are not aware of a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act from the White House. At a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the federal response to the coronavirus crisis, Admiral Brett Giroir told senators, \"I don't know what that is. I supply public health advice as much as I can for whatever that plan would be.\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concurred that he is \"not aware\" of any such plan. In 2017, Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal Obamacare and pass their own health care plan. In an ongoing fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration filed a Supreme Court brief in June, asking the high court to invalidate it. The case will be heard by the highest court exactly one week after Election Day in November. A\u00a0poll released Thursday\u00a0by the Cook Political Report and Kaiser Family Foundation found a majority of voters in Sun Belt political battleground state trust Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Mr. Trump to better handle the nation's health care - Arizona (53% - 44%), North Carolina (53% - 45%) and Florida (52% - 45%). Since March, job loss has further gutted Americans reliant on their employers for health care. And according to the Federal Reserve,\u00a0nearly 40% of households with income below $40,000\u00a0were laid off or furloughed by April. Arizona is one of the battlegrounds the Trump campaign is focusing heavily on. Second Lady Karen Pence is in the state for the latest in a flurry of Trump administration and campaign visits this week, kicked off by a visit by Mr. Trump on Monday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0\"We just came from the Latinos for Trump headquarters, a place that was buzzing with energy,\" Arizona's Governor Doug Ducey said Wednesday at a roundtable with Ivanka Trump. \"We had the president of the United States in on Monday. We've got Ivanka in on Wednesday. We've got the second lady tomorrow and Vice President Pence on Friday. There couldn't be a better way to kick off Hispanic heritage month.\" The president's campaign has aggressively traveled to Arizona even at the height of the pandemic, a state that the\u00a0Cook Political Report\u00a0concluded Thursday was \"slipping away from Trump\" after decades of reliably supporting GOP presidential candidates. Meanwhile, Biden has yet to visit the state this year. In late August, Biden had first floated plans to return to in-person campaigning amid the pandemic with stops in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Arizona. After stops in the other three states, Biden and his running mate have yet to disclose any plans to visit the state in person. Joe Biden's campaign on Thursday aimed to push a middle-class centered economic message ahead of the candidate's drive-in town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on CNN. Asked about Biden's insistence last week that he would raise corporate taxes on \"day one\" of his presidency, campaign policy director Stef Feldman explained, \"I think what the vice president was being clear about the fact that he has no patience for people who say that we do not have the capacity to make sure that the super wealthy and corporations pay their fair share.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0notes conservatives have questioned Biden's willingness to raise taxes at all if elected, as the economy tries to rebound from the brunt of the pandemic. In addition to raising the corporate tax rate back to 28%, Biden hopes to increase individual taxes for Americans making more than $400,000. If enacted, Biden's proposed tax increases would be the fifth largest tax increase since the 1940s, according to a nonpartisan Tax Foundation analysis. And late on Thursday, Biden along with wife Jill, wished a happy new year to Jewish Americans celebrating Rosh Hashanah. During the virtual event, Biden quipped, \"The rabbis and I have been learning the same skills recently: how to sermonize over Zoom.\" Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg announced 28 endorsements through his Win the Era PAC, which is aimed at helping and supporting down ballot candidates who represent the next generation of leaders, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Some notable candidates who the PAC is endorsing include Democratic Senate candidates, such as Theresa Greenfield in Iowa, MJ Hegar in Texas and Reverend Raphael Warnock in Georgia. In addition to supporting several state House races, Buttigieg is also endorsing several congressional members who were in tough races last cycle, including Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Congressman Andy Kim in New Jersey. \"This election, we need to replace the current President and elect leaders at every level of our government who will deliver solutions to the biggest challenges we face,\" Buttigieg said in a statement. \"I believe the voices of these twenty-eight candidates are essential to changing our politics, and I'm committed to doing everything I can to make sure they are successful on November 3rd.\" According to a press release, Win the Era plans to hold virtual campaign events to support these candidates over the next two months. More Than A Vote and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. launched a 30-second ad that will air during gme 2 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals. The ad, titled \"We Got Next,\" focuses on recruiting younger people to become poll workers and is narrated by Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum. The ad features visuals of NBA players kneeling, activists protesting and footage of young people staffing polling Glocations. \"We got a legacy to uphold. People to make proud,\" McCollum says in the ad. \"We got to take advantage of the moment. Of the momentum. To protect our power, be the vanguards of our voices.\" Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement that COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Black communities and that the elderly population is particularly vulnerable to the virus, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. \"For decades, we have relied on our seniors to staff polling places on Election Day,\" Ifill added in her statement. \"This year, we are making the call to young people to serve so that we can protect our vote and protect our seniors during this pandemic. This is an important, powerful, and urgent call to action to serve our communities in one of the most consequential elections in our lifetime.\" Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has asked a federal court to dismiss a suit brought by members of the Navajo Nation who claim the state's election-day deadline for mail-in ballots violates the Voting Rights Act.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports the secretary's filing came as Chief Judge G. Murray Snow issued a rare rejection late Wednesday of a myriad of motions to intervene as defendants, including from President Trump's campaign and the Arizona Advocacy Network. Hobbs warned the court that changing the state's deadline mere weeks before Election Day could \"sow confusion in the electorate generally as well as among Navajo voters.\" The Navajo Nation has also distanced itself from the suit, according to a\u00a0court filing, in a cease-and-desist letter warning the organization behind the suit against \"libel and defamation\" for initially claiming to represent the tribe as a whole. A day before early voting starts in the state, several Minnesota counties have seen an increase in absentee ballot applications, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Phil Chapman, the elections supervisor for Saint Louis County, which is home to Duluth, Minnesota, said that part of the initial preparations for the start of early voting included getting the absentee ballot applications in their system. Chapman noted that in 2016, approximately 16,000 Minnesotans voted by mail in the county, and as of Wednesday, the county has received 29,000 absentee ballot applications. The increase in absentee applications compared to 2016 is also prevalent in some Minneapolis suburbs. Paul Linnell, an elections manager for Anoka County, said for the 2016 general, the county had accepted 37,967 absentee ballots, including mail and in-person. As of Wednesday, Anoka County surpassed that total as it has processed 51,440 applications. Linnell also said that the county is in a \"good position\" when it comes to recruiting and training poll workers for Election Day. \"We are getting lengthy list of backups to work the polls on Election Day,\" he added. In 2016, Dakota County had roughly 30,000 absentee ballots returned, but has seen nearly 70,000 absentee ballot applications for the general election as of Thursday, according to county elections director Andy Lokken. Nevada's Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak late Wednesday\u00a0released\u00a0a letter that was sent to Vice President Mike Pence decrying Mr. Trump's recent campaign rallies in the state, expressing \"confusion and utter disbelief\" over rallies held in defiance of the state's caps on mass gatherings and social distancing guidelines, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. The president has repeatedly denounced Nevada's governor after the campaign's initial plans ran afoul of Nevada's coronavirus measures,\u00a0accusing Sisolak\u00a0of being \"a political person\" in a recent White House briefing and linking his criticism to the state's recent move to expand mail-in voting amid the pandemic. \"It's the secretary of state here, who happens to be a Republican, who oversees the election here as well as our administrators, our local registrars,\" Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat,\u00a0told Fox News. \"There won't be any cheating on behalf of the governor or anyone here.\" Pennsylvania's highest court made several rulings Thursday that have the potential to help Biden in the state, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. First, the state Supreme Court ruled that the Green Party's presidential candidate can't be on the general election ballot because of a failure to closely follow nomination procedures. Then, the court ruled that Pennsylvanians will have a three-day extension to return mail ballots with the Postal Service and the option to return them in drop boxes. That decision could mean many more Democratic votes are counted in Pennsylvania. In the state's June primary, over twice as many Democrats as Republicans applied to vote by mail. In that election, counties received nearly 100,000 mail-in ballots after Election Day, the majority of which came in the three days following it, the secretary of the commonwealth testified in another court case. That's over twice as many votes than Mr. Trump won the state by in 2016. The court also ruled that voters can return ballots by hand to drop boxes set up by counties. The Pennsylvania State Department allowed the drop boxes in the primary, but the Trump campaign asked a federal court to ban them. After the state Democratic Party filed a parallel lawsuit asking the Commonwealth Court to explicitly allow them, the federal court judge stayed the Trump campaign's case to let state courts make a ruling on the issue. The state Supreme Court used its King's Bench authority to overtake the case and ruled in favor of Democrats. Additionally, the court denied a request from the Trump campaign to allow out-of-county poll watchers. But it sided with the Trump campaign on so-called \"naked ballots,\" ruling that ballots missing a secrecy envelope should not be counted. It also ruled that third parties cannot return ballots for voters, a decision Mr. Trump praised in a tweet. Read more about the Green Party decision and its implications\u00a0here\u00a0and the court's other rulings\u00a0here. Democratic Caucus Biden participated in a conference call with Democratic Senators on Thursday where, according to senators on the call, Biden spoke about how he wants to work with everyone and understands the work of the senators, report\u00a0CBS News Capitol Hill producer Alan He\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia told reporters there weren't many questions on the call but there were comments asking Biden to come to their state, and Manchin said that Senator Doug Jones of Alabama was appreciative of the effort and support Biden has put toward the state. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told reporters Biden and the senators during the call spoke about current Senate races broadly with some incumbents speaking about their own races. South Carolina After a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed the South Carolina Senate race tied, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a seven-figure investment in the state to bolster Democrat Jaime Harrison against incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. In the announcement, the DSCC said the investment will go towards supporting TV ads and other resources. Harrison's campaign announced Thursday morning it raised $1 million alone yesterday. The Cook Political Report rates this race as leaning Republican.",

            "article_content": "Republican state legislative leaders from several Big Ten states are asking conference commissioner Kevin Warren to reconsider his decision to postpone the football season, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. \"After hearing from many concerned students, parents and coaches, we have been encouraged to convey our support for their wishes and our responsibility to defend the students' long-term academic and career interests,\" the letter read. \"Recent actions taken by other conferences across the country to start football and other fall sports have placed the Big Ten, its members and students at a disadvantage.\" The letter was signed by Republicans from Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all battleground states in the 2020 election. It echoed recent calls from President Trump for the Big Ten to start its season. The president spoke with Warren last week, but there's been no significant movement toward starting the season. On Sunday, Mr. Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0that governors in Illinois, Maryland and Michigan didn't support playing this season. This will be Joe Biden's busiest travel week of his general election campaign yet, as he travels to Pennsylvania twice and Michigan once. With 56 days to go until Election Day, Biden held no public events today and remained at his Delaware home. On Wednesday, Biden travels to Warren, Michigan, to speak about manufacturing and jobs. This will be his first trip to the critical battleground state since right before social distancing took hold in March. Biden's last major in-person rally was in Detroit on March 9 when now-running mate Kamala Harris endorsed him. Biden now travels with a small footprint, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson,\u00a0who is following the Democratic nominee this week. Around four campaign aides and a small digital production team fly with Biden on his jet while a group of limited national press tag along in a follow plane. Dozens of Secret Service flank Biden, and this added layer of physical protection also ensures at least some social distancing for the 77-year-old former vice president. President Trump continues to question Biden's age and ability to be commander-in-chief, but on the trail -- in actions both planned and seemingly impromptu -- Biden aims to show voters that his age is not a concern. He sprints up plane steps, jogs to his black SUV and barely breaks a sweat in the waning summer heat. Asked by Harrisburg's ABC 27 on Monday about Mr. Trump's criticism of his fitness, Biden replied, \"Look at how he steps and look at how I step. Watch how I run up ramps and how he stumbles down ramps, okay?\" He then added, \"I promise you I would not be running unless I was in really good health.\" With\u00a0reports\u00a0that the Trump campaign is facing a cash crunch and has lost its money advantage to Joe Biden, President Trump has promised to pump his own funds into the campaign if the need arises. \"We have much more money that we had last time going into the last two months, I think double and triple,\" Mr. Trump said before departing Washington for a trip to North Carolina. \"If we needed any more, I'd put it up personally like I did in the primaries last time,\" he added. On a call with reporters, campaign manager Bill Stepien conceded that he is \"carefully managing\" the team's budget, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. \"I consider it to be among the most, if not the most important task for any campaign manager,\" Stepien said, adding that one of his first undertakings as a campaign manager was recreating the budget. But Stepien also brushed aside the reports of a cash shortfall and said from now until November 3, team Trump will have more to spend than it did during the same period in 2016. \"We're very comfortable and confident in where we're spending and how much we're going to have down the stretch,\" Stepien said. He also said \"early investments that the campaign and the RNC made in the field will not only pay dividends during periods of absentee and early voting\" but also on Election Day. With less than 60 days to go, the Trump campaign is also launching a new ad campaign today called \"The Great American Comeback\" and will air ads starting today in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. Later this month, the first presidential debate will take place. Stepien is already preparing by watching tapes of Biden's previous debates. He sized up Biden as \"really good\" at debating and added that he's not surprised to see a lifelong politician perform well on that kind of stage. \"He's a politician, he gives speeches, he's really good at doing it,\" Stepien said, adding that Biden won all of his VP debates in 2008 and 2012. \"Joe Biden is not formidable anywhere else, but he is formidable on the debate stage,\" Stepien said. He went on to claim that Joe Biden on the debate stage scares Democrats not because he might have a gaffe but \"because of the radical ideas\" the Democratic nominee has adopted \"are so scary and so unpopular.\" The Trump campaign also unveiled a new radio ad Tuesday aimed at Black voters, reports\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. It will run in eleven urban markets including Detroit, Flint, Raleigh and Charlotte, according to Stepien. The multi-state buy also includes Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia and Florida. The ad contrasts the president's record with Biden's on issues like criminal justice reform and the economy. It's narrated by former football star Herschel Walker and Georgia State Representative Vernon Jones, both of whom spoke at the Republican National Convention. \"I've known Donald Trump for 37 years. He keeps right on fighting to improve the lives of Black Americans,\" Walker says. Jones, a Democrat adds, \"I'm a lifelong Democrat and I'm part of a large and growing segment of the Black community who are independent thinkers and we believe that Donald Trump is the president that America needs to lead us forward.\" Mr. Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2016 and campaign officials have pointed to recent polls that indicate rising support for the president following the convention. Last month a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll showed Biden leading the president among likely Black voters 90% to 6%. \"These radio ads are another example of the continued investment President Trump's campaign is making to engage directly with the Black community,\" said RNC senior communications adviser Paris Dennard. In\u00a0this week's episode\u00a0of \"The Debrief with Major Garrett,\"\u00a0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\u00a0explores the impact of the coronavirus on the trillion-dollar travel industry and how hotel, airlines, cruises, and the rest of the industry is evolving going forward. The new episode, \"Planes, Trains, and COVID-19\" features interviews with\u00a0CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg, United Airlines vice president of international networks and alliances Patrick Quayle, and Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, and many others. \"The only hope the travel industry has is that in certain areas, certain geographic areas, that leisure travel can make a slow comeback, but it's predicated on so many different factors being all aligned that it's going to be slower than anybody thought,\" Greenberg said. Mississippi is the 12th state where voters will see artist Kanye West's name on the ballot this November, after the state's Board of Election Commissioners approved his filing on Tuesday. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that West filed 1,219 signatures in the \"Show Me State\" last Friday, surpassing the 1,000 signatures required. That same day, he also\u00a0filed\u00a0in Kentucky and had his petition\u00a0approved. West's run for president has hit a number of snags. Of the states he has filed in, 10 states have rejected his filing. His campaign is currently challenging rejections in four states: Wisconsin, Ohio, West Virginia and Arizona -- where his attorneys appealed a lower court's decision to the state's supreme court. He's also expected to appeal his rejection in Virginia. West filed his first campaign finance report over the weekend, and it shows he made a $6.76 million loan from his personal funds to his campaign. From July 15 to August 31, the campaign spent $5.86 million in total, including $1.28 million to the Republican-leaning Atlas Strategy Group consulting firm and $2.69 million to the Millennial Strategies consulting group. Among Millennial Strategies' past clients are Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign and various Democratic committees and candidates in New York. The report also listed $3,900 to Chucktown Bar and Grill to help host and attract signature gatherers in South Carolina. Cedric Smalls, owner of Chucktown, told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0the money was welcome. \"That money really helped out my staff tremendous. For me, as owner of a venue, the publicity helped out. This time in COVID... any extra is a boost,\" he said. Michigan GOP Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey is indicating the state legislature may pass a law to allow clerks in Michigan to begin processing ballots before Election Day, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. \"It wouldn't surprise me that we get enough support to do something before the general election and then evaluate it afterward,\" Shirkey\u00a0told\u00a0the Associated Press' David Eggert. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has been urging the state legislature to pass a bill to allow ballots to be processed before Election Day. Without that change, Benson has warned it could take until Thursday or Friday before all votes are counted in Michigan. Clerks have also said it would save election workers from an exhausting Election Day. Eighteen states allow officials to process ballots, beyond just signature matching, before Election Day. Election officials in other key\u00a0battleground states, including Pennsylvania, are also calling for the ability to process absentee ballots before Election Day to help speed results. President Trump heads back to Nevada this weekend, where recent polling has suggested Biden's lead could be narrowing, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Though the state has handed victories to Democrats for years in statewide contests, some worry about trends prompted by the pandemic, including crippling unemployment that could drive some of their working-class base out of the state. The campaign's visit could also buoy the down-ballot bids for GOP House candidates like Dan Rodimer, who recently\u00a0touted the president's endorsement\u00a0in his challenge of incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Susie Lee. \"In the midst of a global pandemic, Trump is endangering Nevadans' health and safety with in-person rallies in a desperate bid to spin his ineffective management of the coronavirus crisis and dangerous economic policies, which have left working families behind at every turn,\" the Democratic state party's chairman William McCurdy II said in a statement Tuesday. Asked about the possibility the event could run afoul of the state's cap on mass gatherings, as a previous Trump campaign event\u00a0did in August, a Trump campaign spokesperson said the event would provide masks, hand sanitizer, and temperature checks for all attendees. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose continued to push for absentee ballot envelopes to be postage paid at a press conference Tuesday morning. LaRose said there will be a decision on this issue on September 14 from the Ohio Controlling Board. He noted that including postage paid absentee ballot envelopes does not \"have any particular partisan impact,\" and LaRose believes adding postage paid to absentee ballot envelopes will encourage voters to send in their absentee ballots quicker. \"We want them to send it in sooner,\" he said. \"We don't want these to sit on people's kitchen tables or counters for days and days on end.\" If the controlling board approves pre-paid postage on September 14, LaRose said the deadline is logistically tight, but said his office will provide first-class postage to Ohio's county board of elections. \"At this point, it is too late for printing envelopes,\" he said. LaRose announced that his office is also redesigning how their office reports results on election night. In addition to tabulating and releasing results, LaRose explained his office will also release the number of outstanding absentee ballots. Voting rights groups also sent a letter to LaRose urging him to add more ballot drop boxes in each county, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. LaRose is limiting each county to one ballot drop box, and he previously said that he believes he does not have the legal authority to add more drop boxes. In the letter, voting rights groups, including Common Cause Ohio and All Voting Is Local, pushed LaRose to reverse his directive on limiting drop boxes, to work with Ohio's county board of elections to examine multiple drop box locations and to publish guidance on how to use and locate drop boxes. The groups also ask LaRose to standardize \"instructions for elections officials to process absentee ballot applications promptly and uniformly.\" Pennsylvanians have reported that they've received robocalls spewing misinformation about mail-in voting, according to Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports the calls falsely stated that voters who cast ballots by mail will have their personal information shared with law enforcement agencies and credit card companies, according to a press release from Boockvar's office. \"Pennsylvanians must be vigilant against such lies, which are nothing less than an attempt to suppress their vote and should only rely on verified official sources of election information,\" Boockvar said in a statement. Law enforcement is investigating and will prosecute if the law was broken, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in the release. In another battleground state, Michigan, the secretary of state and attorney general gave a similar warning nearly two weeks ago about a robocall to a Detroit resident that used \"racially-charged stereotypes to deter voting by mail,\" according to a release. The coronavirus pandemic has ensured that Election Day 2020 will be like none before. Keeping up with so many new changes can be difficult, so\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0compiled a dictionary of some of the new terms you'll be hearing this election season. To help clarify voting in 2020, CBS News spoke to New Mexico's Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver about need-to-know Election Day jargon. Toulouse Oliver is the president of the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), the nation's oldest, nonpartisan professional organization for public officials that is largely focused on election and voting issues. No matter what part of the voting process you have a question about, Toulouse Oliver stressed two things: Every state operates differently and rules are changing, so it's vital to check with your state to stay informed on election matters and to vote as early as you can to ensure your ballot is counted. All the terms you need to know are\u00a0here. Republicans in New Hampshire will choose their candidate Tuesday to take on Democratic incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Shaheen is facing two non-competitive candidates in the Democratic primary and will likely advance to the general election in November. Retired Brigadier General Don Bolduc and attorney and military veteran Bryant \"Corky\" Messner are the leading contenders in the Republican primary. Popular Republican Governor Chris Sununu ruled out a Senate run early on in 2019, and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski teased jumping into the race for many months but ultimately did not run. President Trump\u00a0endorsed Messner in June via tweet. Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire by less than one percentage point in 2016, so the Trump campaign has made the state a target this cycle, holding three rallies in the state since last summer.\u00a0Recent polling\u00a0shows that down the ballot, Shaheen leads her GOP challengers. It was another busy ad day for the House battlefield, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The National Republican Congressional Committee dropped eight new ads today, five of them in districts that incumbent Democrats hold. A majority of them are centered around\u00a0campaign finance,\u00a0taxes\u00a0and House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi. Their ad in\u00a0New Mexico's 2nd\u00a0targets Democrat Xochitl Torres Small for taking $175,000 from \"radical environmentalist\" groups -- though Small has been one of a few Democrats to publicly be against the Green New Deal, which she uses\u00a0herself in an ad. Republican Nancy Mace, who is facing Democrat Joe Cunningham in South Carolina's 1st, also released an ad Tuesday, focused on the protests and civil unrest. \"From Portland to Charleston, America is under attack. Joe Biden has stood silent, and so has Joe Cunningham,\" Mace says in the\u00a0ad. The Democrat-backed House Majority PAC dropped seven ads Tuesday, four of them in districts Democrats are hoping to flip this cycle. The topics range from a candidate's record as sheriff to healthcare. Their\u00a0ad in Texas' 21st,\u00a0Congressman Chip Roy's seat, talks about Gold Star Families and a past vote Roy took against tax relief for these families of fallen soldiers. Roy has been\u00a0attacked\u00a0for this vote before, and\u00a0explained\u00a0his vote was against language on home schooling and education being stripped from the final bill. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also released three ads today in\u00a0California's 21st,\u00a0Nebraska's 2nd\u00a0and\u00a0Iowa's 3rd.",

            "article_content": "Indiana was the latest state to change its presidential primary date due to the ongoing\u00a0coronavirus crisis, joining six other states that have postponed their primary elections, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Ohio, Louisiana, Maryland, Kentucky, Connecticut and now Indiana will have their elections in June, and Georgia postponed its elections until May 19. In an executive order, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb said vote by mail will be allowed for all voters, and that ballots meant for the original May 5 date will still be valid. Puerto Rico could be the next to be added to the list after its senate approved of moving the election to April 26, pending an official signing by Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced. Republican Congressional candidate Mike Garcia said in a virtual town hall Thursday night that California's 25th special general election to fill Katie Hill's former seat will remain on May 12. He said mail-in ballots will be sent to voters in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties starting on April 15, though he did not know yet if in-person voting would still be an option. \"It's a whole new world and the way we've been campaigning has changed dramatically,\" he added.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Joe Biden held a press call Tuesday from his Delaware home and answered questions on the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus crisis,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. He also pulled back the curtain on how his campaign is managing its day-to-day operation during this time of health hypervigilance. Biden said\u00a0 that throughout the coronavirus response, President Trump \"has been behind the curve.\" He added that he believes the president is falsely telling the American people about action that he has not actually taken. On coronavirus testing efforts, Biden said \"it was simply a lie\" when the president promised that tests were available for anyone who wanted one. \"Where the hell did that come from?\" Biden pondered about some of Mr. Trump's other statements, like the promise of the U.S. Navy ship Comfort to assist the lack of hospital beds in New York. Biden said the public only learned later the ship was currently in maintenance and wouldn't arrive for weeks. For his part during this social distancing time, Biden told reporters that his campaign \u2014 with the help of a \"professional team\" \u2014 is in process of working on how to best communicate with the public and reporters.\u00a0 CBS News is told the campaign's virtual communication strategy is expected to be in place this weekend. Biden is spending his days with four to five hours of going over \"detailed memorandum\" on the virus and he estimated spending around 7 hours each day on the phone with those on the front lines like hospital workers, mayors and governors. \"A helluva job,\" Biden said about New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Responding to a question from CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, Biden reiterated he would put the Defense Protection Act into effect to assist greater production of in-need medical items. The former vice president also hat-tipped some small businesses like distilleries that are making hand sanitizer. Biden noted his team continues to follow CDC guidelines, so the limited staff that are around him are wearing gloves and masks. \"Promise you are going to hear more from me than you want to,\" Biden told reporters in signing off from the call. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg\u00a0announced\u00a0Friday he's transferring $18 million to the Democratic National Committee's Coordinated Campaign to help Democrats running up and down the ballot.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the move by the billionaire's self-funded campaign is the largest by a presidential campaign in recent history and falls within federal campaign finance laws that allow for the unlimited transfers from candidate committees to party committees. At the same time, the Bloomberg campaign will transfer several of its former field offices to state parties and help accelerate hiring for positions in organizing, data and operations. In a memo on Tuesday to DNC chair Tom Perez, the Bloomberg campaign said Bloomberg's number-one objective in 2020 is defeating Mr. Trump and helping Democrats win in November. \"Mike Bloomberg entered this race to ensure Democrats win \u2014 keeping the House blue, flipping the Senate, winning key state and local races, and taking back the White House \u2014 and this commitment through November helps do exactly that,\" it read. \"By supporting the Democratic Party, we look forward to November and taking on our unified goal of beating Donald Trump.\" According to the Bloomberg campaign, it hopes the $18 million investment will help \"dramatically expand\" the DNC's Battleground Build-Up 2020 program. The effort began in January to help lay the groundwork for an eventual Democratic nominee and down ballot candidates in the general election. It focuses on funding offices and staff in 12 states including Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. \"With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump,\" said Perez in a statement. As part of its General Election Unity Program, the DNC said it's working with all of the former primary presidential campaigns to transfer infrastructure including staffing, fundraising and other programs into helping supporting Democrats' general election efforts. ANDREW YANG Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang's brand-new nonprofit plans to contribute more than $1 million to working families impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak in New York City and across the country, the group announced on Friday. The Humanity Forward Fund, a nonprofit founded by Yang after he suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, will begin sending $1,000 over the next couple of weeks to 1,000 households in New York City's Bronx borough. \"We figured out very quickly that people are going to need money immediately. And our government should do this,\" Andrew Yang told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0in a\u00a0phone interview on Friday. \"[This fund] exists to demonstrate the power of these ideas, so we started giving money out immediately.\" Yang is no stranger to cash stipends. Before the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., Yang, then a presidential candidate, proposed granting every adult American monthly payments of $1,000, turning the concept of \"Universal Basic Income\" into a household name, for many. \u00a0His presidential campaign launched a \"Freedom Dividend Pilot Program\" to test and promote his signature policy, in December 2019. IN THE HOUSE House candidates in Georgia from both sides of the aisle are calling for the resignation of Senator Kelly Loeffler after it was\u00a0revealed\u00a0she sold stock after a Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee coronavirus briefing and before the stock market dropped.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says Mark Gonsalves, a Republican businessman,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that \"Taking advantage of the Coronavirus pandemic for personal financial gain is an alarming lack of judgement that renders Sen Loeffler unfit to represent Georgia in the US Senate.\" Gonsalves added \"we cannot claim to 'Drain the Swamp' in DC and be afraid to call out our own party for swampy behavior... Bad behavior from the political class should not be tolerated, it's time to stop the nonsense! We can no longer accept their phony excuses.\" Loeffler said on\u00a0Fox News\u00a0she was not aware of the transactions before they occurred, and that the action was made by third-party investment managers. Democratic frontrunner Carolyn Bourdeaux called for Loeffler's resignation in a statement, and said \"when she could have used her knowledge and vast financial resources to help Georgia hospitals stock up on facemasks and other lifesaving supplies, our Senator downplayed concerns and thought it was more important to protect her bottom line.\"\u00a0 In committee news, a new internal DCCC poll shared by a Democratic aide shows that 49% of registered voters approve of the actions taken on coronavirus by Congressional Democrats, with 45% approval of how Trump has handled the pandemic and 42% for Congressional Republicans. The poll, which was taken between March 11 and 16, painted a bit of a different picture than the latest\u00a0ABC/Ipsos poll\u00a0of all adults that showed 55% approval for how Mr. Trump has handled the pandemic. \u00a0 Lastly, on the money front, according to their February\u00a0FEC filing, the DCCC brought in more than $11.5 million in direct contributions from February, bringing their total war chest to $72.5 million. By comparison, the National Republican Congressional Committee\u00a0raised\u00a0$9.6 million in direct contributions, and have $45.1 million cash on hand. CARE PACKAGES Starting on Wednesday, March 18, and going through the weekend, Michigan Republican Congressional candidate Peter Meijer's campaign will be delivering care packages to vulnerable communities.\u00a0Operation F.R.E.D., named after Peter's grandfather and founder of the Meijer grocery stores Frederik Meijer, uses already-donated campaign funds to bring $25 to $50 worth of groceries and toiletries to groups that request the help online.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that it's an effort that Meijer campaign spokesperson Noah Sadler said was created after taking a look at how to campaign during the coronavirus pandemic, and realizing the traditional way of doing it \"is not going to suffice right now.\" Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said that Senator Kelly Loeffler had attended a classified briefing on coronavirus. It was a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee briefing on the topic. This article has been updated.",

            "article_content": "After a Super Tuesday that Bernie Sanders had hoped would showcase his dominance but instead established Joe Biden's dramatic comeback, the Vermont senator said, \"Of course I'm disappointed,\" but also noted he had won the primaries in his home state of Vermont, Utah, Colorado and likely California. \u00a0 \"Now, I haven't seen the latest delegate count, but my guess is that after California is thrown into the hopper, it's gonna be pretty close. We may be up by a few. Biden may be up by a few. But I think we go forward, basically neck and neck,\" said Sanders, voicing confidence in his standing. By 4 p.m. Wednesday, Biden had 494 delegates to Sanders' 425 and had won 10 out of the 14 states that voted Tuesday, according to CBS News' calculations. Sanders sought to remind reporters at his field office in Burlington that he was exceeding expectations. \u00a0\"If everybody here thought that a year would come and go, and we would be either tied for first \u2014 a few votes up, a few votes down, delegates up or down \u2014 that is a pretty amazing achievement,\" he added. Sanders admitted some pitfalls, including the fact that young voters, essential to his political revolution, have yet to show up in the numbers he was hoping to see. \"This is a campaign which is trying to bring, and it is not easy,\" he said. People who have not been involved in the political process so if you might want to ask me, maybe as a follow-up question, 'have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?' And the answer is no. We're making some progress, but historically, everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in.\" He expressed hope that this would not be the case after the primary process was settled, but his disappointment in the turnout of young voters was palpable. \"I think that will change in the general election, but I am honest \u2014 be honest with you,\" he said. \"We have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process. It is not easy.\" Sanders also talked about the ideological divide between him and Biden, who has in 48 hours become Sanders' biggest obstacle to the Democratic nomination.   \"What this campaign, I think, is increasingly about is: Which side are you on?\" he said. Sanders listed his familiar criticism of Biden on health care, trade, entitlements, the bankruptcy bill, and the Iraq War, using the refrain, \"Joe is going to have to explain to the American people \u2026\"American people want. They want a serious debate on serious issues.\" Sanders brought up his most consistent and oldest critique of Biden, the funding of his campaign and slammed him over the super PAC supporting his candidacy.\u00a0 \"Does anyone seriously believe that a president, backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and low-income people desperately need?\" Sanders asked. He often reminds crowds that he does not have, want, or need a Super PAC. He also contrasted their records on health care, trade, entitlements, the bankruptcy bill, and the Iraq War. Sanders used the refrain, \"Joe is going to have to explain to the American people \u2026\" to highlight the contrasts.\u00a0 Throughout his critique of Biden, Sanders said he did not want his campaign to \"degenerate into a Trump type effort where we're attacking each other.\" He said that he looks forward to a serious debate on the issues.\u00a0 He also told reporters that he had spoken on the phone a few hours earler with Elizabeth Warren, who failed to win any states on Tuesday, including her home state of Massachusetts, where she placed third.\u00a0 \"What Senator Warren told me is that she is assessing her campaign,\" he said. \"She has not made any decisions as of this point. And it is important, I think for all of us, certainly me, who known Elizabeth Warren for many, many years, to respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision.\" Warren's departure from the race would likely help Sanders' standing in the races ahead. He's hoping to do well in Michigan, where he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Should he win, it would solidify his argument that he can build a coalition of urban and working-class voters. A loss would imply he is losing support, especially after failing to win Minnesota and Massachusetts. \"We are going in there with a full expectation and the hope that we will win,\" he said, calling it an \"enormously important state\" and one \"I feel very comfortable in.\" Trade is one issue he expects to bring up in Michigan. Although he is trying to emphasize his distance from the former vice president, Sanders is trying to highlight his own relationship with the president he served, Barack Obama. Sanders released an ad Wednesday morning featuring President Obama's praise of Sanders on some issues. Asked by CBS News what he hoped to achieve with that message, Sanders responded that though the two are not \"best friends,\" he and Mr. Obama talk every so often. Sanders said that he wanted to combat \"dishonest statements about my relationship with Obama, to say that I worked with him and respect him and look forward to working with him.\" Though he welcomed the news Mike Bloomberg had dropped out of the presidential race, he predicted Bloomberg's financial support would buttress Biden's campaign and be used in negative ads targeting him. \"It's what the media has been talking about for months,\" Sanders said. \"How do we stop Bernie Sanders? How do we stop a movement of working people and low income people? How do we stop a multi-generational, multi-racial movement, which is standing up for justice? And what you do is you get candidates out of the race to rally around Joe Biden and now, Joe will have behind him [\u2026] Obviously, as the ninth wealthiest person in this country who's worth some $60 billion dollars, I suspect we will see, you know, a lot of money coming into Biden's campaign, probably a lot of negative ads attacking me.\" CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS TRANSCRIPT FOR GRAHAM ALLISON PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: It's great to have you on the show. It's actually an honor to have you on the show because you are, in my view, one of the great statesmen of national security scholarship in the United States. So welcome to the program. GRAHAM ALLISON: An honor for me to be with you.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: This episode is part of a series of episodes that we're doing between the election and the inauguration. We're going to cover all the key national security issues that are facing our nation. We started last week with H.R. McMaster, who gave us an overview of all the issues. Now we're going to start taking a deep dive on each of them.\u00a0 We're going to start today with China, an issue that I know you have been thinking a lot about and writing a lot about for some time now. Let me just let our listeners know that even though we're taping this the Thursday after the election, we still don't know who won. I think that's a good thing for our discussion, because what I want to focus on is what should the United States do- not what will it do- under a particular administration? In putting together a China strategy, what's the issue we're trying to deal with? What's the problem that we're trying to solve?\u00a0 GRAHAM ALLISON: The first place to start is to recognize that in the China challenge, we face a more severe challenge and a more complex challenge than we've ever faced before. Indeed, much more complex than the Soviet Union and the Cold War, where you and I have earned our bones. China is not just, as Washington now calls it, another 'great power competitor.' China is a specific and acute form of great power competitor, namely a thucydidean rival. The defining characteristic of the thucydidean rivalries is the rapid change in the tectonics of power in which one state, the rising power, is not just threatening but actually displacing the other competitor, the ruling power, from positions and prerogatives that it's become accustomed to over the period in which it's ruled, often a century, and upending the international order of which it's been the principal architect and guardian. This is a challenge to the identity of the ruling power 'who we are.' Americans think and believe that we are and deserve to be and need to be number one, because we've been shaping an order quite successfully. That's now given us seven decades without great power war, a great achievement historically. The reality is that China is a meteoric rising power and that in many domains it has overtaken and displaced the U.S. from our position at the top of every pecking order. The implications of this for the international order are basically upending what we've been accustomed to as the American led international order. This will be the defining feature of all international challenges that the new administration will face for not just this administration, but as far as anybody can see. MICHAEL MORELL: What are the objectives of our China strategy? What are we trying to achieve? GRAHAM ALLISON: The place to start is where you and I, and our colleague Sandy Winnefeld, co-authored a piece recently, \"American National Interest.\" The first question to ask about international challenges in our foreign policy is what matters more for us than other things that really matter. The core of our national security interest is the survival of the U.S. as a free nation with our fundamental institutions and values intact. That's the mantra that became refined in the Cold War and that you and I and many others cited over and over. 'What's essential for the survival of the U.S. as a free nation with our fundamental institutions and values intact? Can we live in a world in which China has a bigger GDP than we do?' I hope so. 'Can we live in a world in which China displaces us as the principal trading partner?' I hope so. But will this be a different world and a more complicated world?\u00a0 The answer is 'absolutely right, you bet.' What we care about in the first instance are vital American national interests. We care about the international operating system, that the Americans have led in building. It has allowed the U.S. and world to survive and thrive. It has also been challenged and stressed by the emergence of another power that will be equal to and in some dimensions have advantages over the U.S. Then we have our alliance system, which is a component of this, because in the period in which the U.S. was unipolar power, the U.S. had about half the world's GDP. So a strategy that we could manage and pay for when we had half the world's GDP is extremely different than the policies we have to manage where we have one seventh of the world's GDP. We're still a big, huge, powerful, I would say, the most single powerful nation on Earth. But we now have China, which is a serious thucydidean rival. We have other great powers, Russia, which remains a nuclear superpower, and we have the emergence of other powers who really matter, whether Japan or Turkey or Iran.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: What is the fundamental objective as we try to deal with China?\u00a0 GRAHAM ALLISON: \u00a0I would start with even a narrower objective, we want to guarantee the survival of the U.S. and our well-being. Now, what's necessary for that? We've imagined it is the American led international order and the entire operating system. But I suspect we'll discover that we will need to make some significant adjustments and adaptations. Let me just go back to the core. We as old Cold War warriors can remember when we finally got it into our head that even though we had a fierce rivalry with the evil empire, which I believe Ronald Reagan was right when he named it. At the same time, we lived in what came to be known as a M.A.D. world in which M.A.D. stood for mutual assured destruction. As Reagan would always remind people, a nuclear war cannot be won because it would actually erase us from the map. It will therefore not be fought. We had to constrain our competition with and our rivalry, with an evil empire, to survive. In order to pursue whatever other objectives. If it turns out to be a Biden administration.\u00a0 I think a second M.A.D. will become more visible and a more important part of American policy. It would recognize that in climate terms, if either the U.S. or China, the two big greenhouse gas emitters- actually China emits almost twice as much greenhouse gases we do right now. Either one of these two emitters can so disrupt the enclosed biosphere that neither of us can live in it. Another arena where we're fierce rivals, but we have to find a way to live together.\u00a0 What about the international order? I think that's where the challenges will occur as we think about what's the alignment and what are the alliances. In the book that I wrote Destined For War, I reproduced this seesaw in which you imagine the U.S. on one end of a seesaw and China on the other, each represented by the size of its GDP. What we discovered is that in the twenty first century, China has gone from being about a quarter of the size of our GDP to now larger than we are, by the metric that CIA says is the best yardstick, namely purchasing power parity. It's lifted our feet off the ground on this seesaw. There's a necessity, therefore, for us to have allies to sit on our side of the seesaw, to rebalance things. So when dealing with China, we can deal from an advantageous correlation of forces rather than from a position of inferiority. MICHAEL MORELL: How do you think the Chinese see us? GRAHAM ALLISON: I think the Chinese watch us with fascination. They study us. In fact, their leadership knows a lot more about the U.S. and our history and our strengths and weaknesses than I'm afraid many of the people in our leadership know about China. They understand that we've been the greatest power in the world- that maybe the world has ever known. That we've created an international order in which they thrived. Nobody has benefited more from working within the American led international order than the Chinese. But at the same time, they believe that their time has come, that this is going to be a Chinese century. That a culture and a civilization, which in their story for 4000 years was the leader and center of the universe, was displaced from that just a couple of hundred years ago by Westerners with technology that exploited and humiliated and imperialized China. They think that period is over and that China is now returning to its natural place as the centerpiece of the order. They believe that there's one sun. Everybody else revolves around it. As they say, there's one tiger in the valley, not two.\u00a0 Their conception of us and their ideal- I've talked to most of the people in their leadership who work directly for Xi Jinping about this. They like the thucydidean rivalry story in the case of the U.S. and Great Britain. I focus usually on the rise of Germany at the beginning of the 20th century, and its threat to displace Britain. That was basically the primary cause of World War I. But at the same time, the Americans were rising, and we rose meteorically after the civil war. By 1900 we had a GDP bigger than Britain's. By 1914, probably 25 or 30 percent larger. So Britain, facing two rivals at the same time, found it necessary to accommodate to the U.S. We were reasserting our position as the dominant power first in the Western Hemisphere and then ultimately displacing Great Britain from its position as the leader of the international order. We did so in a way that was very graceful and brilliant and smart because we distinguished between what's called vital interest and things that are simply visible. They thought what was vital for them was the survival of Britain and its empire that included Canada, to which we were a plausible threat. They thought they could accommodate us on who would be the dominant power in the Atlantic. It turned out to be the U.S. I have a delicious chapter in my book called What If Xi's China Were Just Like Us?\u00a0 Because Americans like to preach to other people about why they should be just like us. When we were emerging under Teddy Roosevelt to what he was confident was going to be an American century. Our behavior towards Great Britain, which they then had to accept and adapt to, was way more outrageous than anything Xi Jinping has done so far. MICHAEL MORELL: Is there a name that you would give to that strategy? Second, what do you think are the key pieces of that strategy? GRAHAM ALLISON: I've been thinking about this since I sent this book to the publisher more than four years ago. The book Destined for War, which was published just as Trump became president, is essentially the diagnosis of the problem that we face: this thucydidean rivalry. The question is how to escape to the thucydidean trap. How can we defend and advance our interests and values facing a world that's defined by the thucydidean rivalry. I think we have to find a way to hold- it is passing the Scott Fitzgerald test of a First Class Mind. The First Class Mind is the ability to hold two contradictory ideas in your head at the same time and still function. Our strategy is to hold in our head two contradictory ideas. One of which is the fiercest rivalry we ever saw. We really do want to compete and not just compete, but win in key arenas that are essential for our national interests. At the same time, we live in a world in which we both have superpower nuclear arsenals that could destroy each other. So if we have a nuclear war with China, you could actually imagine the outcome being both nations erased from the map. It's impossible for anybody to really envision. But you and I thought about that a lot back in the Cold War. Secondly, we really do live in a contained biosphere and that greenhouse gases anybody puts up goes into the same biosphere and impacts the climate for everybody. We're going to have to both be cooperating in areas where we face mutual existential threats that neither of us can deal with acting alone. That's going to require a degree of coordination and cooperation. At the same time, we're each fiercely attempting to outdo the other as to who's going to dominate A.I., who's going to dominate quantum, who's going to have the superior military forces? If you look at a scenario like Taiwan, can you both be a rival and a partner at the same time? I've been studying this in the business world. They have something they call coopetition, which they think is not that unusual. If you look at Apple and Samsung, they are two fierce competitors in selling smartphones. Actually, Samsung has a beat Apple in that in that market for the last four or five years. But at the same time, who is Apple's biggest supplier of components for smartphones? It's Samsung. I asked Tim Cook this 'What's going on here? How can your fiercest competitor be your essential supplier?' He said life is complicated. MICHAEL MORELL: Graham, finish a thought for me. If we get this right, what does it look like? GRAHAM ALLISON: Unlike any period that you and I have ever seen before, this is going to be an instance in which the home front comes first. By this, I don't mean Trump's America First. I mean that we have to recognize, as we now see with the uncertainties about the outcome of the election, that our country is deeply divided. Lincoln, who said many wise things, never said anything wiser than when he said a house divided cannot stand. What we saw is a consequence of a house divided in our civil war, that more Americans killed more Americans in our own civil war than have ever died in any other war. This is a fundamental problem we face at home. And in the same way that in the 1850's or if you go back to Franklin Roosevelt when he came to office. We have to get our own house in order. That is all easy to say and extremely hard to do. But the bottom line of this first point is that if we fail to deal with our problems at home, we won't have to worry about our problems abroad because we can never be stronger abroad than we are at home. Secondly, we have to recognize that China is a fierce rival on the one hand, but that we live in a world in which we have to survive with them. Third, if you go back to the seesaw analogy. The guy on the other side of the seesaw has four times as many people as we do, but currently they're about a quarter as productive as Americans. So why couldn't they be half as productive? They're smart, they're hardworking, so they'll have a GDP twice ours. And they can have a defense budget or intelligence budget twice ours, where they will not be constrained by money. So we need other folks of weight to be on our side of the seesaw. There is a necessity for allies. It is absolutely the contrary of withdrawing from our alliance structure. We need to review, reexamine, and maybe zero base the alliance system because a lot of it is inherited from the Cold War or from before. It will be essential to have other nations allied and aligned if we're to have a favorable correlation of forces.\u00a0 Forth, going on at the same time is this notion of relentless globalization in which the combination of technology and consciousness is shrinking the globe.\u00a0 Now virtually everybody can connect to everybody. Everybody can see something that's happening almost everywhere. That technological process can be slowed or diverted for a bit, but it's happening. What's happening simultaneously with this is that by engaging the whole globe, this has seen huge increases in well-being for everybody. Adam Smith taught us this about trade. Whereas if you and I trade, we can each have twice compared to if we tried to do it alone. This has happened in almost every arena. If you look at the advancement of knowledge, the advancement of technology, or the advancement of cuisine. What would life be like if we had only to eat food from North Carolina where I come from, or Ohio where you came from? Everybody's lives have been enriched by a process of globalization, but we're also becoming more conscious of the ways that it has downsides. We see this in the pandemic, but we also see this in it symmetrically advantaging China in some spaces. That's another complexity. The agenda for whoever is trying to manage global competitive coexistence. It would involve recognizing China's a rival to us in every dimension. The rivalry is going to impact everybody everywhere. It's competitive because it really does matter who's number one in A.I. given its applications for intelligence and the military and many other arenas. We have to be sure we manage it sufficiently, that we don't end up making a climate we can't live in, or have a nuclear war that destroys us all. MICHAEL MORELL: What does the world look like if we and China get this right? And what does the world look like if we don't? GRAHAM ALLISON: There's a reason why you were a brilliant intelligence analyst, and I would rather be asking the questions to you. If we get this wrong, we could have the most catastrophic war history has ever seen. What I try to do in the book, Destined for War is locate the U.S. China rivalry on the map of history. I look at the last 500 years, I find 16 cases, in which a rising power threatened to displace a major ruling power. 12 of those cases end in war. Devastating war.\u00a0 A great example is World War I. How in the world could the assassination of an archduke who is a second level official in Sarajevo in June of 1914 have created a conflagration that was so devastating that historians had to create a whole new category to describe it? That's why it's called World War I. In a thucydidean rivalry where Germany really was rising to threaten Great Britain's position, as it had been the ruler of the world for 100 years. The sun never set on its empire. It was the ruler of the waves. As this occurred, this magnifies misperceptions, it multiplies miscalculations, and it leaves both parties vulnerable to some incident or accident, like the assassination of an archduke that triggers a cycle of reactions that in five weeks allowed an event that hardly mattered to most people to have dragged everybody into a war. The bad side of this would be a devastating war.\u00a0 Unfortunately, I think if Thucydides were watching this drama today, he would say both the rising power and the ruling power look like they're right on script, and they seem to be accelerating towards what could be the grandest collision of all times. A good pathway to that is described in the two pieces that you and your co-author wrote about Taiwan. I can easily imagine Xi Jinping deciding, especially if we go into an extended period of confusion and distraction here with our own domestic politics, deciding that he can do for his Taiwan problem what he's done with the Hong Kong problem. Use force and solve it, which they're doing quite successfully in Hong Kong. If they were to do that and we were to come to the military support of Taiwan, I think we could find ourselves, God help us, in a catastrophic war.\u00a0 That's the bad news. On the good news side. If we take the cases from history, 4 out of 16 cases, there was no war. One of those was the Cold War, where ultimately the contradictions in the crazy Marxist, Leninist, Soviet command and control system hollowed the place out to the point that it collapsed. China is trying, with its party led authoritarian government to make something work that certainly has never worked historically. I take my clues from Lee Kuan Yew, who managed a non-democratic Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew said China cannot be a democracy because if it were to, its governance would collapse. But at the same time, he told Xi Jinping repeatedly, and I talked to Lee Kuan Yew about this at some length, he told him, 'What you're currently doing is not going to work. You're trying to take a 20th century operating system, this party led authoritarianism, and piece on to it 21st century apps. Where everybody has a smartphone. Everybody can see everything. Everybody can know everything. You can put up your firewalls. Everybody intelligent can get a VPN and then get around them. So this is simply not going to work.'\u00a0 One possibility is the rivalry goes on for some period of time. We get our act together, a dysfunctional democracy today, but one that I'm hopeful and confident will get its act back together, as we've done several times before when we almost went over the cliff. That's one story. An alternative story that the Chinese like better is, as I mentioned before, the accommodation that Britain made to the U.S. as we emerged to be first arrival, then to overtake Great Britain, and then ultimately to displace it. It's hard for people like me, who's a very red blooded American, to imagine.\u00a0 History reminds us, that doesn't end. There's no final point in history. It evolves. And in the evolution, people's minds and views change. Could we imagine a world in which 50 years from now, China is several times larger than we are, but we and an alliance system and China remain in some combination of rivalry and some degree of cooperation? And their system has evolved to allow more political freedom for their citizens? It sounds a bit romantic, but I can almost imagine that.\u00a0 I think that what we're in for is they can sense history doesn't end. There is a rivalry, a necessity to coexist, and therefore to cooperate to some extent. Where it's essential for our survival in a long-term competition where we will see whether we can make our democracy work successfully to deliver more of what people want than any other system of government. That's what we believe. And their party leadership will try to see, if they can make a party led autocracy, deliver more of what people want then than any alternative system. If that were a fair competition- certainly there are some defeatist Americans who wouldn't embrace that. But I would with confidence that our core beliefs in individuals, liberty, and demand for realizing what we say are they're endowed rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness applies to all people, Chinese and Americans and everybody else. MICHAEL MORELL: You mentioned a number of publications. Let me quickly go through them. The first is your terrific book, Destined for War. You mentioned an article that you and I and the Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Sandy Winnefeld, recently wrote in Foreign Affairs. That title is \"Why American Strategy Fails: Ending a Chronic Imbalance Between Ends and Means.\" You mentioned two articles that Sandy Winnefeld and I wrote on China and Taiwan. Folks can find those at Naval Proceedings. The title of that of those are \"The War That Never Was\" and \"The War That Never Was Part Two.\"\u00a0 Graham, thank you so much for joining us. This is an incredibly complicated issue and it's going to be something that people are talking about for a very, very long time.",

            "article_content": "President Obama praised Joe Biden in a speech on the third night of the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, and criticized President Trump in the clearest terms yet. Mr. Obama delivered his speech from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. The 44th president has rarely criticized Mr. Trump by name, but he did not hesitate to denounce his successor Wednesday night.\u00a0 \"I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,\" Obama said. \"But he never did.\" \"For close to four years now, he's shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't. And the consequences of that failure are severe.\" Good evening, everybody. As you've seen by now, this isn't a normal convention. It's not a normal time. So tonight, I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election. Because what we do these next 76 days will echo through generations to come. I'm in Philadelphia, where our Constitution was drafted and signed. It wasn't a perfect document. It allowed for the inhumanity of slavery and failed to guarantee women \u2013 and even men who didn't own property \u2013 the right to participate in the political process. But embedded in this document was a North Star that would guide future generations; a system of representative government \u2013 a democracy \u2013 through which we could better realize our highest ideals. Through civil war and bitter struggles, we improved this Constitution to include the voices of those who'd once been left out. And gradually, we made this country more just, more equal, and more free. The one Constitutional office elected by all of the people is the presidency. So at minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us \u2013 regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have \u2013 or who we voted for. But we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that regardless of ego, ambition, or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect, and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for and went to jail for; fought for and died for. I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't. And the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. Now, I know that in times as polarized as these, most of you have already made up your mind. But maybe you're still not sure which candidate you'll vote for \u2013 or whether you'll vote at all. Maybe you're tired of the direction we're headed, but you can't see a better path yet, or you just don't know enough about the person who wants to lead us there. So let me tell you about my friend, Joe Biden. Twelve years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn't know I'd end up finding a brother. Joe and I came from different places and different generations. But what I quickly came to admire about Joe Biden is his resilience, born of too much struggle; his empathy, born of too much grief. Joe's a man who learned \u2013 early on \u2013 to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him: \"No one's better than you, Joe, but you're better than nobody.\" That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts \u2013 that's who Joe is. When he talks with someone who's lost her job, Joe remembers the night his father sat him down to say that he'd lost his. When Joe listens to a parent who's trying to hold it all together right now, he does it as the single dad who took the train back to Wilmington each and every night so he could tuck his kids into bed. When he meets with military families who've lost their hero, he does it as a kindred spirit; the parent of an American soldier; somebody whose faith has endured the hardest loss there is. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president \u2013 and he's got the character and the experience to make us a better country. And in my friend Kamala Harris, he's chosen an ideal partner who's more than prepared for the job; someone who knows what it's like to overcome barriers and who's made a career fighting to help others live out their own American dream. Along with the experience needed to get things done, Joe and Kamala have concrete policies that will turn their vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality. They will get this pandemic under control, like Joe did when he helped me manage H1N1 and prevent an Ebola outbreak from reaching our shores. They'll expand health care to more Americans, like Joe and I did ten years ago when he helped craft the Affordable Care Act and nail down the votes to make it the law. They'll rescue the economy, like Joe helped me do after the Great Recession. I asked him to manage the Recovery Act, which jumpstarted the longest stretch of job growth in history. And he sees this moment now not as a chance to get back to where we were, but to make long-overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody \u2013 whether it's the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, or the shift worker always on the edge of getting laid off, or the student figuring out how to pay for next semester's classes. Joe and Kamala will restore our standing in the world \u2013 and as we've learned from this pandemic, that matters. Joe knows the world, and the world knows him. He knows that our true strength comes from setting an example the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators. A nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change, terrorism, poverty, and disease. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala is that they actually care about every American. And that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They believe that no one \u2013 including the president \u2013 is above the law, and that no public official \u2013 including the president \u2013 should use their office to enrich themselves or their supporters. They understand that in this democracy, the Commander-in-Chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. They understand that political opponents aren't \"un-American\" just because they disagree with you; the free press isn't the \"enemy\" but the way we hold officials accountable; that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depend on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up. None of this should be controversial. These shouldn't be Republican principles or Democratic principles. They're American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him, have shown they don't believe in these things. Tonight, I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala's ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. But here's the thing: no single American can fix this country alone. Not even a president. Democracy was never meant to be transactional \u2013 you give me your vote; I make everything better. It requires an active and informed citizenry. So I am also asking you to believe in your own ability \u2013 to embrace your own responsibility as citizens \u2013 to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that's what at stake right now. Our democracy. Look, I understand why a lot of Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easier for special interests to stop progress than to make progress. Believe me, I know. I understand why a white factory worker who's seen his wages cut or his job shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him, and why a Black mother might feel like it never looked out for her at all. I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there's still a place for him here; why a young person might look at politics right now, the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and crazy conspiracy theories and think, what's the point? Well, here's the point: this president and those in power \u2013 those who benefit from keeping things the way they are \u2013 they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can't win you over with their policies. So they're hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter. That's how they win. That's how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life, and the lives of the people you love. That's how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected, how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks. That's how a democracy withers, until it's no democracy at all. And we can't let that happen. Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you're going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too. Do what Americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this \u2013 all those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marching, keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice. Last month, we lost a giant of American democracy in John Lewis. Some years ago, I sat down with John and the few remaining leaders of the early Civil Rights Movement. One of them told me he never imagined he'd walk into the White House and see a president who looked like his grandson. Then he told me that he'd looked it up, and it turned out that on the very day that I was born, he was marching into a jail cell, trying to end Jim Crow segregation in the South. What we do echoes through the generations. Whatever our backgrounds, we are all the children of Americans who fought the good fight. Great grandparents working in firetraps and sweatshops without rights or representation. Farmers losing their dreams to dust. Irish and Italians and Asians and Latinos told to go back where they came from. Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs, made to feel suspect for the way they worshipped. Black Americans chained and whipped and hanged. Spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters. Beaten for trying to vote. If anyone had a right to believe that this democracy did not work, and could not work, it was those Americans. Our ancestors. They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives. They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the myth. And yet, instead of giving up, they joined together and said somehow, some way, we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words, in our founding documents, to life. I've seen that same spirit rising these past few years. Folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn't be separated. So that another classroom wouldn't get shot up. So that our kids won't grow up on an uninhabitable planet. Americans of all races joining together to declare, in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state, that Black Lives Matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better \u2013 in so many ways, you are this country's dreams fulfilled. Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, it's a given \u2013 a conviction. And what I want you to know is that for all its messiness and frustrations, your system of self-government can be harnessed to help you realize those convictions. For all of us.\u00a0 You can give our democracy new meaning. You can take it to a better place. You're the missing ingredient \u2013 the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed. That work will continue long after this election. But any chance of success depends entirely on the outcome of this election. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes to win. So we have to get busy building it up \u2013 by pouring all our effort into these 76 days, and by voting like never before \u2013 for Joe and Kamala, and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for \u2013 today and for all our days to come. Stay safe. God bless. Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Even as a\u00a0pandemic\u00a0has\u00a0trapped voters and candidates indoors\u00a0and consumed American politics, one key element of the presidential campaign may remain virtually unaltered:\u00a0the vice presidential selection process. Five to eight candidates are now being seriously considered,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Bo Erickson,Zak\u00a0Hudak\u00a0and\u00a0Alex\u00a0Tin\u00a0have learned, though the sources said a \"dark horse\" candidate could be added.\u00a0 The first stage of the search has likely already begun, say veterans of past vice presidential picks, with aides scouring the internet, press clippings, and public records. This probe can largely be carried out even during quarantine. Once Biden's list is sufficiently narrowed, vetters need shortlisters' cooperation to continue the audition. Potential running mates must complete lengthy questionnaires, turn over troves of personal records, and submit their families to invasive interrogations of their public and private lives. Several running mate finalists recounted thorough searches by vetters, uncovering embarrassing details untouched even by other official and campaign background checks.\u00a0 Social distancing wrought by the spread of COVID-19 has already reshaped one assessment: a potential running mate's performance on stage with the nominee's message. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer fueled speculation last week, joining Biden\u00a0on his campaign's podcast. Another rumored running mate \u2014 California Senator Kamala Harris \u2014  called in Wednesday to a virtual fundraiser with Biden.\u00a0 But beyond a pick's public chemistry with the nominee and their campaign, Democratic campaign veterans say the nominee's final decision often ends with an intensely private assessment. \"I met with Barack Obama for three and a half hours. They want to see what the comfort level is like, after all you're going to be in a foxhole together,\" recalled former Indiana Senator Evan Bayh.\u00a0 Obama's selection in 2008 came down to Biden and Bayh, according to multiple Democrats on the campaign at the time, but an additional disadvantage plagued Bayh: \u00a0a Republican governor would have selected Bayh's replacement in the Senate. \"It was an honor to be considered, but to be in that final three, anyone will tell you that it can feel like a colonoscopy. Except they use the Hubble Telescope,\" Bayh said. Read here\u00a0for more vetting tales from former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, who was extensively vetted by Mr. Obama's search in 2008; former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who faced vetting by the presidential campaigns of Al Gore, John Kerry, and Obama; Bob Shrum, a top adviser to John Kerry's 2004 campaign; Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign manager; and more.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden on Monday during a sometimes-scripted virtual town hall on the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic,CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. A few minutes into Biden's remarks on how President Trump \"downplaying the danger\" of coronavirus to keep the stock market high, the virtual curtain was raised and Sanders popped onto the screen. Sanders called on all Americans including \"every Democrat and independent and Republicans to come together to support your candidacy, which I endorse.\" Both men were frank with each other. Sanders said it was \"no great secret that we have our differences and we are not going to paper them over.\" Biden chimed in that people may be surprised how close they are on some issues while apart on others. Going forward, the two men announced they will work together on six different campaign task forces ranging from the economy to criminal justice to climate change. We also saw friendship as Sanders jokingly challenged Biden to a game of\u00a0chess. With Sanders' endorsement, Elizabeth Warren is the only major Democratic presidential candidate to not endorse Biden. She dropped out of the race 39 days ago. PRESIDENT TRUMP The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee announced Monday morning that they raised over $212 million in the first fundraising quarter of 2020, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. According to the campaign, the joint fundraising committees raked in $63 million in March alone, showing the nationwide quarantining has not dented their numbers yet. This quarter's fundraising numbers are the highest the campaign has seen yet, and are a 36 percent increase from the last quarter of 2019. The campaign has over $240 million cash on hand, according to a press release. Separately,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the president's re-election campaign also filed a 63-page\u00a0defamation lawsuit\u00a0against Wisconsin television station WJFW-NBC Monday, after the NBC affiliate ran\u00a0an advertisement\u00a0from Democratic\u00a0super PAC Priorities USA Action\u00a0alleging the president called the coronavirus outbreak a \"new hoax.\" In the 30-second spot featuring spliced audio from the president's February 28 rally in North Charleston, South Carolina, Mr. Trump says \"the coronavirus\u2014this is their new hoax.\" Yet the\u00a0full speech\u00a0reveals the President\u00a0criticized the Democratic response and media coverage\u00a0surrounding his administration's coronavirus response, not the virus itself. Various fact checkers have deemed Priorities USA's edited video\u00a0false,\u00a0manipulated\u00a0and\u00a0wrong.\u00a0 \"WJFW-NBC has perpetrated a fraud on the public by recklessly broadcasting PUSA's defamatory and false advertisement,\" the Trump campaign lawsuit reads, in part, \"which WJFW-NBC knew or should have known was produced through the use of technology that depicted a clearly false statement.\" Last month, the Trump campaign issued cease-and-desist letters to numerous television stations including WJFW, forewarning legal action. \"We fully expected the station would recognize their error and immediately cease under their FCC obligations,\" said Jenna Ellis, Senior Legal Adviser to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.\u00a0in a written statement.\u00a0\"The Trump campaign is now left with no other option than to use the force of law to ensure these false and defamatory ads cease.\u00a0 Defamation law helps ensure that news outlets are accountable to viewers, who should be able trust the accuracy and truth of content aired to the public.\" Monday's lawsuit seeks a monetary \"reward for punitive damages,\" and \"attorney's fees,\" but does not set a price tag. Priorities USA has doubled down on its television advertisement, part of a nearly $7 million, five-state ad buy in the key battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. \"Donald Trump doesn't want voters to hear the truth and he's trying to bully TV stations into submission,\" Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil\u00a0said in a response\u00a0to the new lawsuit. \"The truth is that Trump ignored warnings from experts and his own team and downplayed the coronavirus even as it spread unchecked across the country and the world. Americans are now suffering as a result of his inaction. We will never stop airing the facts and holding the president accountable for his actions.\" WJFW-NBC did not immediately respond to request for comment by CBS News. ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressman Ro Khanna are pushing Congress to include a set of safeguards to protect workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the lawmakers on Monday proposed a \"bill of rights\" for health care workers, delivery drivers, grocery store employees and others whose jobs increase the chances they'll contract COVID-19. The 10-point package calls for essential workers to be given health care, \"robust premium compensation,\" retroactive from the time the pandemic began, and guaranteed sick leave. \u00a0Warren and Khanna also called for protections against collective bargaining agreements and protections for whistle blowers who expose unsafe conditions, as well as government support for child care. The lawmakers said that essential workers \"must be at the table in developing responses to coronavirus\" and that Congress must hold corporations accountable for protecting their employees. \"Essential workers are the backbone of our nation's response to coronavirus,\" Warren said in a statement. \"We have a responsibility to make sure essential workers have the protections they need, the rights they are entitled to, and the compensation they deserve.\"\u00a0 GAME CHANGER While the country grapples with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic and Republican leaders are left considering how they will fund national conventions in the fall.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Jack Turman,\u00a0LaCrai Mitchell,\u00a0Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0spoke\u00a0with more than two dozen Democratic and Republican party leaders, who expressed mixed levels of concern about the economic implications and planning surrounding both parties' political conventions in August. \u00a0\"Even when we're not in the midst of a public health and economic crisis, it's an expensive undertaking to go to a national convention,\" said North Dakota Democratic\u2013Nonpartisan League Party Chairwoman Kylie Oversen. \"And so, that strain is just even larger in the circumstances.\" The Democratic National Convention Committee has said it will work with state parties and delegations to mitigate financial hardships due to the coronavirus. And multiple senior party officials told the\u00a0CBS News political unit\u00a0that the RNC has built a war chest of contingency plans for convention planning. But American industries and households face continuing economic hardship, and political party officials say it's important to remain sensitive to how their conventions may be perceived by struggling Americans.\"[If] we are the party of the people \u2026 then we need to make sure we demonstrate that during the convention,\" added South Carolina DNC member Clay Middleton. \"People, hourly workers, have been hit hard by this. The people we claim to represent have been hurt the hardest and will take the longest to recover.\" WISCONSIN A group of Wisconsin voters filed a federal lawsuit on Monday asking for a full or partial revote of last week's election just hours before results were set to be released, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The class action lawsuit argues that holding the election last week was an attempt to \"disenfranchise thousands of voters in the Spring Election.\" The lawsuit asks for allowing people who weren't able to vote in the election to be able to cast a vote. This may include people who stayed home for health reasons or who had issues with their absentee ballots arriving on time. The case was filed before results were released in Wisconsin to show \"that this action is not partisan (about winners and losers).\" Instead, the lawsuit argues, it was about the fact that voters had to decide between \"exercising their fundamental right to vote in an in-person election during a pandemic\" and \"forgoing their right to vote in order to preserve their life and health and the lives and health of those close to them and the public overall.\" Earlier on Monday, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said \"every legal option is on the table\" for how the state Democratic Party may challenge last week's election. \"The key principles for us are that the election be as fair as possible, so that voters' voices are heard after the extraordinary and outrageous sacrifices they were asked to make to cast ballots, and that we fight really for voters and elections going forward,\" Wikler said. Both Wikler and Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez said many voters sat out the election because they had to decide between health and exercising their right to vote. \"It was voter suppression on steroids,\" Perez told reporters on Monday. As of\u00a0Monday morning, data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission showed that nearly 1.3 million voters requested absentee ballots. Almost 1.1 million ballots had been returned. Last week, on the eve of the election, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an extended deadline for voters to turn in absentee ballots until Monday. But the Supreme Court said that for absentee ballots to be counted, they had to be turned in by\u00a09:00 p.m. ET\u00a0on Election Day or postmarked by April 7. But many voters reported that they didn't receive their ballots until after Election Day. \"It's impossible to submit an absentee ballot by Election Day, when you haven't even received the damn ballot by Election Day,\" Perez said. VOTING RIGHTS Former First Lady Michelle Obama is backing new efforts to make voting safer and more accessible in light of the coronavirus pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion.\u00a0Her nonprofit initiative, When We All Vote, announced Monday that it supports expanded vote by-mail, early in-person voting and online voter registration. Michelle Obama, who serves as co-chair of the organization, called the steps \"critical\" and \"long overdue.\" In a statement, she said \"Americans should never have to choose between making their voices heard and keeping themselves and their families safe.\" For the first time, the group endorsed proposed federal legislation that would require states to adopt contingency plans and permit absentee voting if a significant number of voters or poll workers are quarantined due to COVID-19. \"It's our responsibility to help all voters exercise their right to vote, and to give them the best information on exactly how to do that,\" said When We All Vote Board chair Valerie Jarrett. The announcement comes on the heels of Wisconsin's primary, which drew harsh criticism from some Democrats, including Michelle Obama, after mask-donning voters endured long lines to cast their ballots. She posted on Twitter last week: \"We must do better to ensure voting is safe for all voters.\" Her husband, former President Obama, called the Wisconsin election \"a debacle\" and has also expressed support for mail-in voting. \"Let's not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy, \" he tweeted.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, who voted by mail in the Florida primary, opposes mail-in voting and claims it could lead to voter fraud.\u00a0 But several GOP officials are moving ahead with vote-by-mail in their respective states. Five states currently conduct all elections entirely by mail and 28 states and the District of Columbia offer no-excuse absentee voting. \u00a0\"There is nothing partisan about striving to live up to the promise of our country,\" Mrs. Obama said. \u00a0 STAYING HEALTHY A group of 12 Democratic governors sent a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the Trump administration on Monday calling for a 30-day special enrollment period for the federal health care exchange in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The request comes weeks after the Trump administration\u00a0opted against\u00a0a special enrollment period to help those that lost their employer-sponsored healthcare due to the pandemic. In the letter,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that the governors say many of their residents are uninsured or underinsured and are \"choosing to forgo coronavirus testing and treatment out of fear of the potential costs to themselves and their families at a time of increasing economic distress.\" At least 12 states that run their own healthcare marketplaces have opened their own special enrollment periods, and according to the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation, 37 states and D.C. have opted into Medicaid expansion that helps make this federal health care exchange available. In the letter addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, the governors argue that in addition to getting more people in these states covered, opening up a federal special enrollment period will help in implementing widespread coronavirus testing. \"In a time of a fast-moving pandemic, taking every step possible to expand access to health insurance is not just a responsible choice for the health of the individual, but also for the health of our communities, our states, and the country,\" the letter states.\u00a0 AND IN CASE YOU MISSED IT\u2026 \u00a0On Friday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Cara Korte,\u00a0Zak\u00a0Hudak,\u00a0Tim\u00a0Perry,\u00a0Jack Turman\u00a0and\u00a0Bo\u00a0Erickson\u00a0joined CBSN to break down their takeaways from covering the Democratic presidential primary for the past year.

            "article_content": "As Joe Biden settles into the role of the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Tim Perry\u00a0and\u00a0LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0report\u00a0that some are calling on the former vice president to choose a woman of color as his running mate, while others are specifically hoping a black woman will fill the position. Conversations with more than a dozen black women in Congress and black women political leaders and activists in battleground states revealed this sentiment: it's past time for women of color and particularly black women to be seriously considered for top positions like the role of vice president. Congresswoman Marcia Fudge of Ohio said that at some point the Democratic Party must \"reward and recognize its loyal soldiers,\" namely, black women. Fudge also warned that if the party doesn't mobilize black women, Democrats can't win in November. \"The mistake I believe we have made in the last couple of races we've run is we neglect to bring out our base,\" Fudge said. \"The base of the Democratic Party clearly is black and brown, but more black than brown.\" Many leaders said that race shouldn't be the top or only factor in choosing the right running mate. And all of the black women political leaders that CBS News spoke with said the eventual vice-presidential pick must have a strong grasp on the problems facing the black community and particularly black women.\u00a0Perry\u00a0and\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reported\u00a0on CBSN that while prominent black women like former Georgia State House Leader Stacey Abrams and Senator Kamala Harris of California were mentioned as viable prospects, activists in battleground states like Wisconsin believe that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the candidate who can deliver on issues that are important to black women. \"[Warren] works with people and listens to people and will continue to push the work of making racial justice a priority, advocating for black women's leadership across the country [and] lifting up especially in those down ballot races where there are so many powerful black women running in their communities,\" said Priscilla Bort, who is an organizer for the Wisconsin Working Families Party. Still most of the women reiterated that the ultimate goal for black women has been the same since the beginning of the primary: defeating President Trump. \"Regardless of who Vice President Biden chooses as his running mate, I'm going to be out there making sure that we get out the vote,\" said Georgia Democratic Party Chair Nikema Williams, who is also a Georgia state senator. \"But I think at some point we want to see ourselves reflected in the leadership that we're voting for.\" JOE BIDEN \"He will be an extraordinary President,\" is how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began her endorsement\u00a0video\u00a0of Joe Biden on Monday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. The speaker, who remained neutral during the Democratic primary, riddled off Biden's accomplishments as vice president, crediting him with helping to pass Obamacare and steering the rollout of the Recovery Act after the 2008 economic depression. On the trail, Biden spoke often about President Obama sending him to Capitol Hill to help bring together the priorities of the executive branch and Congress, a possible sign that Biden, when looking for a running mate, may want his own bridge between the Biden White House and the speaker's office. On Monday, Biden's public schedule was bare but he's planning to attend another virtual private fundraiser Monday evening. His campaign also released a lengthy statement on Monday retooling previous criticisms of the Trump administration's COVID-19 response, labeling problems related to testing the \"original sin\" of the effort. PRESIDENT TRUMP On Saturday, Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale announced the Trump campaign is approaching 35-40 million direct voter contacts. \"The average campaign, a successful one, barely gets over 10 million direct contacts,\" Parscale said on this weekend's Trump campaign virtual live stream. \"We're now getting close to 35 to 40 million direct contact. By Election Day, we might close it off at 50 million. That will nearly be over to two-thirds of all the people that actually vote for the president.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga notes that Parscale, a longtime Trump family ally, conceded that the Mr. Trump's support lives largely within GOP party lines. \"The President really has one number that people just, you know, they don't give enough respect to,\" Parscale said. \"That is that 'mid 90s' Republicans approve of the President's job. No president has ever had the demo support from any party. Now, he does have record low support from Democrats. He is a Republican.\" Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said Monday he would not consider delaying the 2020 general election,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. \"I haven't thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It's a good number,\" Trump told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden for the\u00a0coronavirus briefing. Mr. Trump called suggestions that he might try to move Election Day \"made-up propaganda\" by people surrounding the presumptive Democratic nominee. \"Let him know I'm not thinking about it at all,\" Trump added. Last week,\u00a0Biden\u00a0said during a virtual fundraiser, \"Mark my words, \u00a0\"I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.\" \u00a0 Separately, a company working with Mr. Trump's re-election\u00a0campaign is defending a nearly $3 million loan\u00a0it received from the federal coronavirus relief fund for small businesses, responding to criticism and a lawsuit accusing it of receiving preferential treatment. According to\u00a0CBS News senior reporter Stephen Gandel\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News investigative reporter Graham Kates, Phunware was eligible for the low-interest loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, which is aimed at businesses with 500 or fewer workers. The digital data company said in a news release Monday that on March 27 it furloughed 34 full-time employees and three interns, leaving it with 54 full-time employees and one intern. Phunware's $2.85 million loan was nearly 14 times the current PPP average of $206,000. ELIZABETH WARREN Warren on Monday called on Americans to contact their representatives and demand that an essential workers bill of rights be included in the next coronavirus relief package. Warren, who with Representative Ro Khanna released two weeks ago a set of criteria to add protections and benefits for essential workers, also asked essential workers to make a short video to share what their job has been like, according to\u00a0CBS news campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Warren's website now includes a\u00a0page\u00a0with a script for calling your representative to ask for front line worker protections, and the site will automatically dial the representative if you put your address in. On a livestream calling for action, Warren and Khanna were joined by Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Deb Haaland, both of whom were co-chairs for Warren's presidential campaign. \"We've got plenty of ways to get you in the fight because the essential workers Bill of Rights is one very tangible way that we can help level the playing field just a little,\" said Warren.\u00a0 MICHELLE OBAMA Netflix plans to release a documentary following former First Lady Michelle Obama through a 34-city tour for her 2018 book, \"Becoming.\" CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says the film by the same name is set to debut on the streaming platform May 6. In a clip from the documentary released Monday, Obama signaled she is planning for work ahead. \"It's not getting back on track, but it's creating my next track,\" she said, asked about transitioning back to her \"normal life.\" Obama praised the film's director, Nadia Hallgren in a statement. \"She's a rare talent, someone whose intelligence and compassion for others comes through in every frame she shoots,\" she said. \"Most importantly, she understands the meaning of community, the power of community, and her work is magically able to depict it.\" The film's release comes as millions of Americans are under stay at home orders and using streaming services. \"During this difficult time, I hope you'll find some inspiration and joy in this film,\" Obama tweeted.\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Today a spokesperson for the presidential campaign of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0that the campaign will cover the cost of COBRA through November 2020 for both national and state staffers. In an email obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, the Bloomberg campaign tells its staffers to sign up by April 29 for COBRA coverage to begin May 1. \"We all aim to keep ourselves, our families and communities safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said the email to staff. \"The campaign has covered health insurance for former employees since Mike dropped out,\" a campaign spokesperson tells CBS News. \u00a0\"Today's announcement makes it official that given the challenges associated with the pandemic, the campaign will continue to cover health care through November 2020 for former employees who haven't secured other coverage.\" VOTE BY MAIL As the coronavirus changes the way people think about conducting elections,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says there continues to be more polling suggesting growing support for mail voting. But there are some divisions along partisan lines, as Democrats are more likely to embrace it than Republicans, according to a new\u00a0Associated Press/NORC poll. Overall, 39% of American adults said they support their state conducting elections only by mail without in-person voting, compared to 40% who oppose the measure. Democrats (47%) are more likely to favor that than Republicans (29%). In 2018, the AP/NORC poll found that only 19% of American adults supported conducting voting entirely by mail. While Americans remain divided on that issue, a majority (56%) say they support letting people vote by mail without an excuse, while 26% oppose letting people vote that way. If there is a coronavirus outbreak in November, a little less than half of Americans (46%) support allowing people to vote in person. Republicans (58%) are more likely to favor that than Democrats (38%). If there's an outbreak in November, 48% of Americans say they would support conducting the election only by mail. A majority of Democrats, 60%, favor that, compared to 37% of Republicans. There is much more support for no-excuse absentee voting by mail, however. A majority, 60%, of Americans say they would favor that if there's a coronavirus outbreak in November. Almost three-fourths of Democrats (73%) approve of letting people vote by mail without a giving a reason, compared to a little less than half of Republicans (46%). Five states conduct their elections by mailing every eligible voter a ballot and another 29 states plus Washington D.C. off no excuse absentee voting, according to the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures. BIDEN V. TRUMP A USA TODAY/Suffolk University survey\u00a0out Monday shows Biden leading Mr. Trump by 6 percentage points nationwide, 44% to 38%. That is a considerable shift from Trump's 3-point lead in the December poll, during House impeachment proceedings and a crowded Democratic primary, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The poll comes six months ahead of the 2020 Presidential election, as the Trump administration tackles questions surrounding ongoing testing capacity and economic reopening. States face record-breaking unemployment numbers with millions of new claims are anticipated in the weeks to come. Thus far, the pandemic has cost more than 55,000 lives in the United States alone. NEW YORK The New York Board of Elections has\u00a0voted\u00a0to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the primary ballot on June 23, meaning Biden will win all of the 274 pledged delegates, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The obscure provision allowing the board of elections to do this was entered into the state budget signed by Andrew Cuomo at the beginning of the month. Thousands of Sanders supporters signed a petition to keep Bernie Sanders on so he could amass delegates to influence decisions at the national convention, but that failed to sway the board. \u00a0The co-chair of the board of elections Doug Kellner said, \"I think that it's time for us to recognize that the presidential contest is over.\" Kellner was asked if this means there's no primary, and he said, \"That's right. Joe Biden is the only candidate and therefore, he has effectively won the New York primary.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee spokesman David Bergstein said \"Any substantive change to a state's first determining step in allocating delegates like this one will need to be reviewed by the DNC's Rules and By-Laws Committee. Once the state party submits an updated delegate selection plan, the committee will review that plan and make a determination.\" Bernie 2020 senior adviser Jeff Weaver also issued a statement, saying \"today's decision by the State of New York Board of Elections is an outrage, a blow to American democracy, and must be overturned by the DNC. Just last week Vice President Biden warned the American people that President Trump could use the current crisis as an excuse to postpone the November election. Well, he now has a precedent thanks to New York state.\" NORTH CAROLINA CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the North Carolina Democratic Party announced in a press release Monday that it hosted virtual county conventions in 90 of the state's 100 counties over the weekend. According to the state party, more than 9,600 participants attended. In Wake and Mecklenburg Counties alone \u2014 which include the cities of Raleigh and Charlotte, respectively \u2014 the party saw its highest voter turnout numbers, which totaled more than 1,500 attendees combined. \"In recent weeks, our staff has worked tirelessly to assist county parties in adapting these events into a virtual platform,\" said NCDP Chairman Wayne Goodwin in an emailed statement. \"On Saturday, fired up Democrats across North Carolina participated in record numbers. Our members are energized, united and ready to take on President Trump and Republicans down the ballot in November.\" OHIO After the primary was postponed in March, Ohio's mail-in primary ends Tuesday, providing a preview of what could come in November's general election if the coronavirus pandemic continues at a high rate.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports that Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose sent a letter on Thursday to Ohio's congressional delegation indicating that some Ohioans may not get their ballot in time due to post office delays. In the letter, LaRose stated that they are hearing reports that first class mail delivery, which is 1-3 days, is taking up to 7-9 days. \"As you can imagine, these delays mean it is very possible that many Ohioans who have requested a ballot may not receive it in time,\" LaRose wrote. On Friday, LaRose announced the postal office set up hand-to-hand delivery on Saturday for election mail as it went through processing. Post offices will track election mail to the Ohio Board of Elections starting Monday through May 8. As of Monday, there have been 1,975,806 vote-by-mail ballots requested and 1,458,936 ballots cast. LaRose previously indicated his support to extend the vote by mail primary to June 2 in a letter on March 21 sent to Ohio's General Assembly, but Ohio's state legislature voted to extend the primary date to April 28. Voting rights groups said that Ohio's Board of Elections was not fully prepared for the transition to a vote-by-mail primary due to the lack of time it was given. Voting rights groups said the timeline did not provide voters enough time to learn about the vote-by-mail process and did not give adequate time for Ohio's Board of Elections to print more envelopes, ballots and applications. \"The boards of elections and the Secretary of State have been scrambling to make this work,\" said Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, a nonpartisan advocacy group on protecting voting rights. \"Clearly more time would have made this work better for voters and certainly for the people administering our elections.\" There is limited in-person voting in the state Tuesday as well. If voters are disabled or do not have a mailing address, they can vote in-person at the board of elections. In addition, if voters did not receive their absentee ballots, they can cast an in-person provisional ballot at their county board of elections. Precautions are being implemented to maintain safety amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Cuyahoga County, which is home to Cleveland, officials are planning to take voters' temperatures and hoping to maintain social distancing, according to the Cuyahoga County board of elections. In Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, election board members will have masks and partitions will be in place between election staff and voters.\u00a0 WISCONSIN Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers announced loosened restrictions on nonessential businesses in the state to allow for curbside drop-off of goods and animals.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says that would allow businesses such as dog groomers and small engine repair shops to reopen. Those businesses need to ensure staffing can be limited to one person in a room or confined space at a time and services need to be paid for ahead of time online or over the phone. The order also allows people to rent recreational outdoor equipment such as boats, kayaks and canoes. The same staffing and payment restrictions are in place and rented equipment must be cleaned after each use. Automatic and self-service car washes are also able to open. The new order takes effect on Wednesday and builds upon an order last week that allowed nonessential businesses to offer curbside pick-up. \"This order means that every business across our state can do things like deliveries, mailings, curbside pick-up and drop-off, and it's an important step in making sure that while folks are staying safer at home, they can also continue to support small businesses across our state,\" Evers said in a statement. IN THE HOUSE The special election in Maryland's 7th district, formerly held by late Congressman Elijah Cummings, is one of the first upcoming test balloons for an all-mail ballot election. While three in-person polls will be open in the three counties of the Baltimore-area district, more than 513,000 mail ballots were sent out to registered voters across the district. St. Mary's College of Maryland political science associate professor Todd Eberly told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0the special election is a perfectly-sized test case not only for the November presidential election, but for the state's June primaries. \"For us to get a feel for how smoothly does it go, where there are glitches, things that we have to work out \u2013 it gives us a chance to do all of that before the June primary comes, when we're talking about somewhere in the neighborhood of about 4 million ballots in the mail expected,\" he said. In addition to testing the logistics of an all-mail ballot, Eberly said it'll serve as a good step to educate all voters about how it works. \"Time with multiple elections absolutely gives us the benefit of by the time we get to a general election, you've got that real opportunity for people to know it, for the state to know what kind of communications they have to do.\" The ballots have to be postmarked by Tuesday, April 28. While local election boards have been scanning incoming ballots the past couple of weeks, the full count of votes will come after May 8, the deadline for mail ballots to come in. Democratic candidate\u00a0Kweisi Mfume, who previously held the seat from 1987 to 1996, is expected to win the historically Democratic district against Republican Kimberly Klacik. As of\u00a0Friday\u00a0morning, 56,019 Democratic ballots have been returned, compared to 19,097 Republican ballots.\u00a0",

Seabrook portrayed his incumbent as out of touch with the district's issues. Twenty years later, Engel has a challenger in Jamaal Bowman who is not only looking to portray him as out of touch, but also physically out of reach for his constituents in the northern Bronx and southern Westchester.\u00a0 In May, an Atlantic reporter rang the doorbell of his Maryland home and caught Engel in a lie about being in the district for a coronavirus-related face mask giveaway. A couple weeks later, Engel was heard on a hot mic asking to speak at a presser related to protests over police brutality in the district, \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care,\" he pleaded with Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. The moment was a boon for Bowman, a black Bronx school principal running to Engel's left. Within 72 hours of the viral video, Bowman raised $264,000 and picked up the endorsement of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York progressive who knocked off longtime incumbent Joe Crowley in 2018.\u00a0 Bowman has crossed over the $1 million fundraising mark and has received endorsements ranging from Senator Bernie Sanders to Bronx native and television host \"Desus Nice.\" On June 12, The New York Times endorsed Bowman, writing \"in a district that needs new energy, Mr. Bowman will bring it.\" Engel, for his part, said in early June he would have rejected the Times' endorsement after the newspaper printed the controversial opinion column by Senator Tom Cotton and he released a video touting an endorsement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Engel tried to explain that \"in the context of running for reelection,\" he thought it would have been important for people to know where he stood on the protests. \"I would not have tried to impose on the Borough President if I didn't think it was important,\" he said in a statement.\u00a0 The perception that Engel is an absentee congressman is the crux of Bowman's campaign and is similar to the playbook run by Ocasio-Cortez's successful campaign in Brooklyn.\u00a0 \"When I started talking to people about Representative Engel, the word that I heard most often was 'absent,'\" Bowman told CBS News.\u00a0 \"He's never here. He is not present. He is not engaged. It's time for a change. And this was before the pandemic.\" The district encompases parts of Bronx and Westchester County, where more than 80,000 have been diagnosed with COVID-19. New Rochelle, the country's first pandemic \"hot spot,\" is in Engel's district.\u00a0 Pressed about his absence during a primary debate on Tuesday, Engel touted his work in passing the CARES and HEROES Acts, which included $5 billion in funding for New York's hospitals and another $5 billion for the education system.\u00a0 \"If I'm not in Washington, I should be criticized. If I am in Washington, I'm doing my job,\" he said. \"I've now had a lot of seniority being in Congress a long time and I have the clout. I bring home the bacon, I bring home the money. I can do those kinds of things \u2014 that's not something a freshman can do.\" \"Congressman Engel says he brings home the bacon, but we have people in this district that are starving. They were starving prior to the pandemic, they're starving now. So where is this bacon to feed the community?\" Bowman responded.\u00a0 Engel's supporters point to his role as chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, where he helped the investigation of President Trump during the impeachment investigations. Donato Vaccaro, a Democratic district leader in Eastchester, called Engel's influence and work on impeaching Mr. Trump \"huge.\" \"He was really visible this past twelve months with the impeachment proceedings,\" he said, adding, \"That's a significant thing.\"\u00a0 Pelosi also backs Engel, along with the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, which Bowman called \"disappointing but not surprising.\" Congressmen Adam Schiff of California, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina have also endorsed Engel. One notable omission from his list of endorsers is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who was removed from the list online after telling reporters he hadn't actually endorsed.\u00a0 New York political consultant Hank Sheinkopf said while Engel's seniority could help bring home more funds and programs, most voters aren't focused on that.\u00a0 \"Voters aren't saying, 'By the way, if I elect the long-term incumbent whose party happens to be in power, my life will be better.' Were that the case, Joe Crowley would've been re-elected. Seniority doesn't matter, so much as what people know or don't know about you,\" he told CBS News.\u00a0 The primary, including two other candidates in addition to Engel and Bowman, takes place June 23 and has switched to a mail-heavy format with absentee ballot applications being sent to every registered voter. In-person early voting sites open June 21.\u00a0 Bowman has campaigned on economic, housing and healthcare inequity in the district to challenge Engel. Just south of this district is New York's 15th, which has the\u00a0highest poverty rate\u00a0of any congressional district in the country. But within the 16th is the Rye neighborhood, one of the richest in America.\u00a0 Bowman has compared the rapid response in New Rochelle, an upper middle-class suburb, to the slower response in Co-op city, a more minority-heavy area that has the largest naturally occurring retirement community in the nation. \"We knew Co-op City was vulnerable and it took twenty three days after the New Rochelle case to get resources in Co-op City. That's unacceptable. The Trump administration obviously dropped the ball, but our infrastructure was weak to begin with,\" he told CBS News.\u00a0 Progressive groups such as the Justice Democrats have backed Bowman, and Guy Cecil, chair of the largest Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA, has endorsed Bowman, too. On trademark progressive policies, the two candidates are ideologically similar, with both supporting \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal. But there are differences. Daniel Altschuler, the managing director of the Make the Road Action group, said Bowman's fight for rent cancellation and recurring cash payments is one thing that set him apart.\u00a0 \"We need Democrats to fight a hell of a lot harder\u2026 unfortunately there are too many Democrats who fail to fight for those things,\" he said.\u00a0 On the subject of police reform in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, Bowman is calling for demilitarizing and defunding of the police, citing his own run-ins with police profiling growing up as a black child. Engel favors reform and backed House Democrats' Justice in Policing Act, which bans chokeholds and creates a new prosecutorial standards in police brutality cases but does not address police funding. However, in a debate on Tuesday, he said he'd be open to using some of the police budget for other community programs and policing methods. While he espoused the need for a \"structure of a police department, that doesn't mean we have to go with the model we've been using for years and years and years,\" he said. \u00a0 Sheinkopf said it's possible that outrage over the pandemic and police brutality could boost support at the polls for Bowman.\u00a0 \"Sometimes in politics, people tend to think the conditions around them are not related to what occurs,\" Sheinkopf said. \"But in fact, in this race, the anger of large portions in this district that are minority-based, may in fact take over the incumbent.\"\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "With four days to go until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is\u00a0ramping up\u00a0his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. His attacks on Biden and Sanders come as recent polls\u00a0show him lagging\u00a0behind Biden and Sanders, albeit narrowly.\u00a0 \"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\" Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. \"But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\" Buttigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors \"Medicare for All\" and free college tuition at public universities.\u00a0 \"I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts,\" Buttigieg continued. \"And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.\" Buttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating Sanders would be a \"risk\" at a time when Democrats are desperate to reclaim the White House from President Trump.\u00a0 Buttigieg has remained in the top tier of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. The\u00a0most recent Des Moines Register poll\u00a0found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely Iowa caucus-goers while Sanders was the first choice of 20%. The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support.\u00a0 The millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to \"show versus tell\" that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th. He hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in Nevada and South Carolina, where is currently polling well behind Sanders and Biden.\u00a0 While maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, Buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between Sanders and Biden over Social Security. The Vermont senator has\u00a0accused Biden of being open to cutting Social Security\u00a0in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.\u00a0 \"This is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before,\" Buttigieg said. \"The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better.\" After his town hall in Decorah, Buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for. \"We're competing,\" Buttigieg told reporters. \"It's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. I admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0notes that at a speech in Newton, Iowa, Biden spoke about the importance of 2020 Democrats focusing on Mr. Trump and not swinging at each other. The former vice president said we shouldn't \"let this Democratic race slide\" into negative attacks. The \"temptation is too much for some\" Biden added, while highlighting President Obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a \"circular firing squad.\" Earlier in the day, Biden delivered a speech in Waukee, Iowa where he didn't name a single rival Democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. In the home stretch, Biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: The soul of the nation is at risk due to Mr. Trump's actions and moral turpitude.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN As Joe Biden goes up on the air in Nevada with\u00a0several new ads\u00a0in a buy totaling $167,503 this week, per Kantar CMAG data, the former vice president's campaign is also rolling out several new endorsements in the state, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Among them are two former Clark County party chairs, the vice president of the Washoe County School District Board of Trustees, and online betting CEO Joe Asher, who\u00a0was listed last year\u00a0as a top fundraising bundler for Biden.\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Thursday Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his Super Bowl Ad, in a spot that the campaign says \"highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in America,\" according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.\u00a0 The 60 second spot, titled \"George,\" will air Sunday February 2 during Super Bowl LIV.\u00a0 It features the story of Calandrian Simpson Kemp, a mother whose son, George Kemp Jr., was shot and killed in 2013.\u00a0 In the aftermath of her son's death, Kemp has been an active member of Moms Demand Action. \"I chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president,\" Bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign.\u00a0 \"Calandrian's story is a powerful reminder of the urgency of this issue and the failure of Washington to address it. People will be rooting for different teams in the Super Bowl, but virtually all Americans \u2014 including people in both parties and a majority of gun owners \u2014 support universal background checks and other common sense gun laws.\"\u00a0 Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, has used his enormous fortune to self-fund his campaign. Despite a late entrance into the race and his decision to skip the first four voting states, including Iowa where voting begins Monday, Bloomberg is on track to spend more than $275 million on television, radio and digital ads by the end of the week. PETE BUTTIGIEG Equality California, the state's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, and its recently-launched Nevada partner Silver State Equality\u00a0announced Thursday\u00a0they would be backing Pete Buttigieg after an unanimous vote by the groups' endorsement committee.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the former South Bend mayor can use all the help he can get as early voting kicks off in California, where Buttigieg has failed to crack double digits\u00a0in recent polls\u00a0of the Super Tuesday contest.\u00a0 \"While we did not endorse Mayor Pete simply because he's gay, the historic nature of his candidacy has already had a transformational impact on the LGBTQ community,\" Rick Zbur, the groups' executive director, said in a statement, also praising Elizabeth Warren and Tom Steyer for their \"extremely strong\" platforms. TULSI GABBARD Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is\u00a0betting big\u00a0on a strong performance in New Hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. Over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as \"undeclared,\" which allows them to vote in either party's primary in February. And while other candidates focus on next week's Iowa caucuses, Gabbard has all but moved to New Hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other Democratic candidate across December and January.\u00a0 A recent analysis by the New York Times\u00a0reveals just one-fifth of Obama-Trump voters returned to the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted Republican.\u00a0Roughly half of the New Hampshire towns Gabbard has visited backed Mr. Trump in 2016. Her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Democratic Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. But she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream Democratic voters who pick their party's nominee. \u00a0 \"[S]he's pulling from Trump voters. It could make it even tougher for Trump to win, particularly in states like Michigan and New Hampshire,\" Bannon told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders' first TV ads to air in Super Tuesday states are up today in California and Texas. In a 30-second ad aired in Dallas and Los Angeles this morning for the first time, Sanders talks about the rich getting tax breaks while the middle class continue to struggle. \"That's what happens when billionaires are able control the political system,\" Sanders says on camera.\u00a0 CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says he goes on to talk about his campaign being funded by the working people and says those are the people he will represent. In another ad aired in Dallas and San Francisco, a narrator talks about Sanders fighting to raise wages and for health care.\u00a0 \"Our country is at a turning point. Hard working people betrayed by Trump struggling to survive,\" the narrator claims. \"In this moment, we need a fighter. Bernie Sanders, we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has,\" the voice concludes. According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, Sanders is on track so far to spend $1.5 million in California and more than $160,000 in Texas through February 25th, but more ad buys are likely. On Tuesday, the campaign announced it would me making $2.5 million in ad buys in the two states this week. Super Tuesday is March 3rd. PRESIDENT TRUMP The Trump Campaign released one of two ads set to air during the Super Bowl on Thursday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The 30-second ad released Thursday morning called \"Stronger, Safer, More prosperous\" highlights the\u00a0record unemployment numbers\u00a0the United States has seen during the first three years of the Trump administration. According to the campaign, the other 30-second ad will not be released prior to the game.\u00a0 ANDREW YANG With the Iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around Des Moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. \"I think some campaigns have reached out to our team,\" Andrew Yang told reporters at an event yesterday,\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reported.\u00a0 A source close to the Yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0that former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reached out about a deal. The rules of the Iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. Yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. \"I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do,\" Yang said. In Waukee today, Biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to O'Keefe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 STATE-BY-STATE GEORGIA A popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a Democrat in the special election for U.S. Senate in Georgia.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0reports that Reverend Ralphael Warnock, the pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, announced his U.S. Senate bid Thursday in a Twitter video. Warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race.\u00a0 Matt Lieberman, the son of former Senator Joe Lieberman, and Ed Tarver, a former attorney, are also competing for the Democratic nomination. Nevertheless, Warnock's entry could rally Democrats ahead of a fight with what may be a divided Republican Party in the Peach State.\u00a0 The special election is being held to fill the seat held by former Senator Johnny Isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. Governor Brian Kemp appointed financial executive Kelly Loeffler to Isakson's Senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. Loeffler will run in the special election in November to carry out the final two years of Isakson's term, and she has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund. However, Congressman Doug Collins announced his bid for the seat on Wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the GOP.\u00a0 Democrats are targeting a number of House seats in Georgia, as well as the state's two Senate seats. Georgia has been a Republican stronghold for decades, but Democrats hope the state's changing demographics could help them win it back this year.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE The House Democrat campaign arm is confident in using healthcare as their central message for 2020, but didn't specify any immediate plans for any specific ads in some of the most competitive districts they have to defend, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 In a meeting with reporters on Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to \"set a dialogue\" about healthcare and the Senate's inaction on the House's H.R. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices. The ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive Democrat districts. Bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. \"Let's just remember the election is nine months off,\" Bustos said. \"We want to make sure that going into November 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.\" \u00a0 Despite setting their own off-year record, the Republican campaign arm was outraised by the DCCC by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable Democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. Two such members,\u00a0Joe Cunningham\u00a0of South Carolina and\u00a0Anthony Brindisi\u00a0of New York, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside Republican groups about impeachment.\u00a0 Bustos, a Democrat from a district won by Mr. Trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of Democrats she says have compelling arguments. \"They've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. Cindy Axne's done 57 town hall meetings, Joe Cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases\u2026Lauren Underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin,\" she said. \"When you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. And I think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.\"\u00a0 Bustos also said after he dropped out, Beto O'Rourke reached out to the DCCC offering his help if needed. The DCCC themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Secretary Julian Castro, about potential involvement in the House election cycle. \"Where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Note: This has been updated to include Elizabeth Warren's response to the report. Bernie Sanders\u00a0denied\u00a0a report Monday that, in a private meeting in December 2018, he told Elizabeth Warren that he didn't believe a woman could win the presidency.\u00a0 The two progressives have appeared to have an unspoken agreement not to attack one another directly during previous debates. But on the eve of the seventh\u00a0presidential debate\u00a0and weeks away from the Iowa caucuses, the courtesy they've shown toward each other is sure to be tested on the debate stage.\u00a0 Sanders' campaign released an angry statement from the Vermont senator in response to the report published by\u00a0CNN. \"It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,\" Sanders said in the statement. \"It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened.\" But in a discussion about President Trump's tactics, according to Sanders, sexism did come up during their conversation. \"What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,\" he said. He went on to invoke his primary opponent in 2016, who defeated him for the Democratic nod but lost to Mr. Trump in the general election.\u00a0 \"Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016,\" Sanders said.\u00a0 On Monday evening, Warren released her recollection of the December 2018 meeting with Sanders. She said in a statement that they had met for \"more than two hours\" and discussed their work and goals, including beating Mr. Trump. \"Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate,\" Warren continued. \"I thought a woman could win; he disagreed.\"\u00a0 To refute the accusation, Sanders' supporters are also pointing to video of a comment he made in 1988, when he\u00a0said, \"The real issue is not whether you're black or white, whether you're a woman or a man \u2014 in my view a woman could be elected president of the United States \u2014 the real issue is whose side are you on?\"\u00a0 ***Cara Korte, Ed O'Keefe and Zak Hudak contributed to this report. HAWKEYE SHOWDOWN Six Democratic Presidential candidates will get a chance to make a big pitch to caucus-goers during tomorrow night's Democratic Primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Bernie Sanders, businessman Tom Steyer and Senator Elizabeth Warren. As the field of candidates continue to narrow down,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0say polling suggests the race to win Iowa is more fluid than ever before. A recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed Sanders leading the pack with 20%, followed by Warren (17%), Buttigieg (16%), and Biden (15%). Klobuchar in that poll was at 6% and Steyer was at 2%. The fluidity among the top tier was indicated by a Monmouth University Poll released on Monday showing Biden leading the pack with 24% followed by Sanders (18%), Buttigieg (17%) and Warren (15%).\u00a0 Although 40% of Iowans have made up their minds, according to the Des Moines Register poll, 45% said they could still be persuaded while another 13% said they don't have a first-choice candidate in mind. The debate will give candidates a chance to win over undecided voters, discuss issues that concern Iowans, and differentiate themselves with about three weeks to go until caucus night.\u00a0 The Des Moines Register poll found that 82% of likely Democratic caucus-goers say how a candidate has performed on the debate stage is \"extremely important\" or \"important\" for deciding which candidate they plan to support. Former Iowa Democratic Party Chair Sue Dvorsky said she's not sure whether Tuesday's debate will fully sway any undecided Iowans, but said it's an especially important night for the three Senators who could soon have an impeachment trial pulling them away from Iowa.\u00a0 \"This is the end of the beginning,\" Dvorsky said. \"There is a closing argument element to this, but for the senators there's a really important closing element because it is possible that they will not be on the ground making that case themselves.\"\u00a0 As for the issues Iowans care about, 68% of likely Democratic caucus-goers in the Des Moines Register poll said healthcare and climate change are \"extremely\" important issues for them. That was followed by the gap between rich poor Americans (59%) and foreign policy (57%). The impeachment inquiry is an \"extremely important\" issue for only 25% of Iowans. The qualification criteria set by the Democratic National Committee has winnowed down the number of candidates on the debate stage. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, for example, had qualified for the previous six debates failed to reach the polling threshold set for Tuesday's debate. He will hold a town hall in Ames, Iowa instead.\u00a0 New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who\u00a0dropped out\u00a0of the race Monday morning, cited a lack of money that he said is \"harder to raise because I won't be on the debate stage.\" Booker also missed the cut for the December debate stage and had not qualified Tuesday night's debate.\u00a0 Ahead of that first debate in 2020, the\u00a0CBS News Political Unit\u00a0gives a rundown of what to watch for from the six presidential candidates who made it on stage plus other political news of the day in this special\u00a0DEBATE\u00a0edition of Trail Markers. JOE BIDEN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON:\u00a0His critics said he would falter by now, but with only weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden is still in the top tier of Democratic candidates. The recent\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll had him tied for first place, while last week's Des Moines Register poll placed him fourth in an exceedingly tight race.\u00a0 After some rocky performances, the last debate was widely heralded as Biden's best. In the weeks since, foreign policy has been in the spotlight after the U.S. strike against Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and the subsequent retaliation.\u00a0 The discussion of foreign policy has allowed Biden to focus on one of his central messages: That he is ready to lead the free world \"on day one\" due to his global relationships and expertise. But Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations committee chairman, is also vulnerable on this front, particularly due to his 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq War resolution. Sanders, in particular, has been especially critical of the former vice president's support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\u00a0 Biden at first demurred and brushed off Sanders' criticism. But now as other candidates continue to bring up his vote, the former VP and his top surrogate at the moment, former Secretary of State John Kerry, say that the Bush administration misled Congress about the threat posed by Iraq and how they would combat it. However, Biden has not yet gone as far to label his vote for the war resolution a \"mistake.\" WHAT TO WATCH: Will his rivals demand he do so? PETE BUTTIGIEG VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN:\u00a0With weeks until the Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has lost some ground in Iowa, according to the latest Des Moines Register poll. He registered in third place in the most recent poll, after leading the presidential field in November.\u00a0 In the December debate, Buttigieg was criticized by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren for transparency regarding his high dollar fundraisers. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar also pointed out Buttigieg's lack of Washington experience and noted that he lost a statewide race for treasurer in 2010. \u00a0But since the December debate, Buttigieg hasn't really modified his stump speech and has continued to focus on his message of unifying the country while staying true to his values.\u00a0 WHAT TO WATCH: With weeks until the Iowa caucus, what will be Buttigieg's message as he tries to regain momentum in Iowa? AMY KLOBUCHAR VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON:\u00a0Top endorsers of Klobuchar's presidential bid describe the next few weeks as \"high stakes\" as she faces a critical presidential primary debate. Some of her Iowa endorsers, granted anonymity to speak candidly about the campaign, told CBS News they believe Klobuchar should aim to draw more contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday, a strategy she has previously avoided. \"She needs to,\" one endorser said.\u00a0 Klobuchar set her sights on Pete Buttigieg during last debate for what she said was the millennial mayor's lack of experience. And on the campaign trail, she continues to demand that the nominee have a proven track record. WHAT TO WATCH: The upcoming impeachment trial could send Klobuchar back to Washington before the caucuses. Will she use the debate to take a big swing at Buttigieg or Biden, two candidates who wouldn't have to leave the trail to deal with impeachment?\u00a0\u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE:\u00a0All eyes are on Bernie Sanders this go around. He was riding high a week ago with his historic fourth-quarter fundraising and favorable polls, but his rivals quickly took notice.\u00a0 Sanders has been busy trading swipes with Biden over the former vice president's record on Iraq. The Vermont senator has even earned the attention of President Trump, who mocked the senator and his Democratic rivals at a recent rally, on Twitter and in an email to supporters.\u00a0 Both of these spats present good opportunities for Sanders. With Biden, Sanders can call into question the VP's foreign policy judgment and remind voters that, as an independent member of the House, he voted against the Iraq War. As for Mr. Trump, any attention from the White House is likely to reenforce the idea that Sanders is a realistic general election candidate. But a deepening conflict with Elizabeth Warren could create some turbulence for Sanders. The Massachusetts senator told reporters Sunday that she was offended that Sanders' volunteers had reportedly received anti-Warren talking points. She also said that the Democratic Party can't repeat the \"factionalism\" that existed in 2016. \u00a0 In that moment, it's possible that their relationship changed. Sanders hates when people say or allude to him not supporting Hillary Clinton after she won the Democratic nomination in 2016. Voters sometimes ask about it and it clearly irks the senator, who says that he campaigned all over the country for the former Secretary of State.\u00a0 Sanders' staff hates it as well. They see it as a Clinton talking point and a low blow. From their standpoint, Warren \"going there\" by referring to factionalism brings us to a new level of tension between the candidates.\u00a0 While the volunteer talking points reportedly came from Sanders' staff, the Vermont senator himself has largely avoided directly critiquing Warren, his fellow progressive. Warren, however, has directly placed the blame on Sanders for the talking points, not his campaign's employees.\u00a0 Their fight only got messier on Monday, when CNN reported that Sanders had told Warren in a December 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't win the presidency. Warren's campaign has stayed publicly mum about the report, while Sanders has said it's totally false.\u00a0 \"It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened,\" Sanders told CBS News. Translation: The Warren campaign is making a last-ditch effort to pull ahead in Iowa. But notice Sanders placing responsibility on Warren's staff and not the senator herself \u2013 a difference between their two approaches.\u00a0 WHAT TO WATCH: Will Sanders take it to Warren on the debate stage? TOM STEYER VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK:\u00a0Tom Steyer is ready to scratch and claw for airtime in the Iowa debate. \"You're going to see tomorrow night that Tom is a fighter,\" National Press Secretary Alberto Lammers told CBS News. Steyer plans to aggressively pitch his business record and climate activism on stage Tuesday, according to his campaign. The campaign argues that Steyer has been disadvantaged by networks giving other candidates more time on the debate stage and by a lack of polling in Nevada and South Carolina. But a pair of polls in the two states last week indicated Steyer may have something resembling momentum in those two early states.\u00a0 In Iowa, however, Steyer's polling has been stagnant, never breaking out of the single digits. His campaign argues that the four-way dead heat in Iowa has opened a lane for someone like him to emerge. \"I don't think we can say there's a front-runner in Iowa right now,\" Lammers said. Still, while other candidates will rely on their Iowa and New Hampshire performances for fundraising, Steyer's personal wealth almost guarantees he'll make it to the states where he has more support.\u00a0 WHAT TO WATCH: Will Tom Steyer finally have a moment on the debate stage? ELIZABETH WARREN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK:\u00a0After a year of dancing around one another, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have squared up just in time for the Iowa debate. The two have campaigned almost entirely under an unspoken truce to this point, but have recently taken subtle, but sharp jabs at one another.\u00a0 After a script given to Sanders volunteers reportedly suggested Warren was a candidate of the elite, an attack that has long-irked Warren loyalists, the dynamic between the two progressives reached a boiling point. \"We all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016, and we can't have a repeat of that. Democrats need to unite our party,\" Warren said in Iowa Sunday, after expressing her disappointment that \"Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me.\"\u00a0 Sanders downplayed the memo, suggesting it hadn't come directly from him and calling its fallout \"a little bit of a media blowup.\" Tensions grew Monday when CNN reported that four anonymous sources said Sanders told Warren in 2018 that he didn't think a woman could win the presidency. In a statement, Sanders called the accusation \"ludicrous\" and said, \"staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened.\"\u00a0 Warren's campaign declined to comment, but she and Sanders are all but certain to be asked whether the 2018 conversation happened in the debate\u00a0Tuesday night.\u00a0 WHAT TO WATCH: Will Warren accuse Sanders of saying a woman can't win the presidency when they're on the debate stage? \u00a0Or alternatively, will she deny the report?\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG On Monday, former New York City Mayor and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg called into question the Democratic Primary calendar and said it currently sets Democrats up for failure in the general election. \u00a0 In an op-ed published on CNN.com, the Democratic presidential candidate pledged that, as president, he would ensure that the DNC works with state party leaders to re-order the primary calendar. Bloomberg argues that currently the schedule causes Democrats to focus their resources on two small states, Iowa and New Hampshire, that are not representative of the country and are not helpful to Democrats winning in a general.\u00a0 \"As a party, we are spending all of our time and resources outside of the battleground states we need to win.\" Bloomberg wrote. \"Meanwhile, President Trump is spending his time in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and North Carolina -- all states we lost in 2016 by razor-thin margins.\" CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry\u00a0says\u00a0that this is a major shift from Bloomberg's previous comments, with the former mayor saying as recently as last week that the current schedule should remain the same and that Iowa, in particular, should continue to go first.\u00a0 \"I think we have a tradition here of four states: two with caucuses, two with elections. They've worked very hard. They love the attention. The system has gotten used to it and I guess the Democratic Party probably shouldn't take it away.\" Bloomberg told reporters after a delivering remarks in Akron, Ohio last Wednesday. \u00a0 \"I campaigned in all four of those states, before I decided not to and I can only tell you I thought the cross section of society, they were smart, they asked the right questions, they're politically astute, and I thought to myself, 'ya know, it's a pretty good system.'\"\u00a0 In response to Bloomberg, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0in a statement, \"It seems like Michael Bloomberg is having some second thoughts about his choice not to campaign in South Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Iowa - and is doing what many candidates in that position have done who are desperate for some press attention.\"\u00a0 Buckley continued, \"Also, anyone who thinks New Hampshire isn't consequential in the general election must also believe that Al Gore served a term as president of the United States.\" Over the weekend, Bloomberg declined to weigh in on Bernie Sanders' surge in recent early-state polls, but Bloomberg told\u00a0CBS News\u00a0that he would support Sanders if the Vermont senator were to win the nomination. \"I think that the number one thing is to replace Donald Trump, and while I certainly would disagree with Bernie on an awful lot of things, if it's Donald Trump vs. Bernie, I would support Bernie.\" TULSI GABBARD Representative Tulsi Gabbard has made a 10-day, $50,000 ad buy in New Hampshire\u00a0featuring a new spot\u00a0denouncing war overseas, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"I've seen the cost of war. When I came home, I promised to fight for peace,\" the ad reads. Gabbard will appear in an Iran-focused panel alongside former Congressman Dennis Kucinich and author Stephen Kinzer at NHTI Community College on Tuesday.\u00a0 DEVAL PATRICK Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick's campaign announced Tuesday that they'll air a 30-second ad in New Hampshire during Tuesday night's Democratic debate on CNN.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the Patrick campaign has spent $107,000 on New Hampshire ad buys in the new year, according to Kantar Media. Monday night, Patrick will meet with a prominent gun control organization, Moms Demand Action, in a closed meeting in Stratham, New Hampshire. ANDREW YANG Andrew Yang will not be on the debate stage, but he will be in Iowa for a town hall event in Ames.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports that the campaign insists this debate will be among the least viewed and will likely be drowned out by other events like the escalating situation in the Middle East.\u00a0 They also point to their rising poll numbers as a sign that they're still very competitive. Not being on stage, however, carries some risks. The debates have proven, for better or worse, to be \"legitimizing\" in some respects, and some candidates that have missed them in the past seen their campaigns flame out. But with the caucus right around the corner and enough money to compete in the early states, Yang may not need the visibility from being on stage this late in the game. However, if Iowans are watching to help them make up their minds before caucus day, Yang runs the risk of being an afterthought. He'll need to work twice as hard to keep potential Yang voters engaged. WORKERS UNITE Senator Bernie Sanders received the endorsement of New Hampshire's second largest union on Monday, SEA/SEIU Local 1984. Despite the local backing, its national affiliate organization, the Service Employees International Union, has remained neutral in the 2020 presidential race thus far.\u00a0 \"We have constantly seen a decline in wages, benefits and pensions in this country,\" local President Rich Gulla told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0of the decision. \"For decades, the distribution of wealth keeps getting larger and larger, the middle class keeps getting smaller and smaller.\" A Sanders presidency, Gulla contended, could fix that. The chapter president also vowed the organization would support the eventual Democratic nominee. Approximately 10,000 workers in New Hampshire belong to the union's collective bargaining contract. The chapter also endorsed Sanders in 2016, though its national wing supported Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 In September, Sanders met with employees of the Rockingham County Nursing Home ahead of a vote to unionize under the SEIU Local 1984, speaking with employees at a rally. \"Now they're standing with him,\" New Hampshire State Director and longtime aid to Senator Bernie Sanders Shannon McLeod told CBS News. \"They've come out to say we're with you, you're the best candidate in our eyes for the state of New Hampshire, for the president of the United States. And it is such an honor to have their endorsement.\" BIG APPLE BOOSTS Congressman Max Rose of New York's 11th district announced his endorsement for former-New York City Mayor Bloomberg on Monday. In a release from Bloomberg's campaign, Rose talked about the work Bloomberg did after 9/11 and said he \"brought New York City back to life and put us on track to lead in the 21st century.\" Rose also said Bloomberg's \"even keeled and visionary leadership is what we need to reduce the chaos, partisanship and hyper-vitriol that has overtaken Washington.\" CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that Rose raised more than $1.2 million in the fourth quarter and has $2.5 million cash on hand going into 2020. Rose flipped the seat covering Staten Island and part of Brooklyn by more than six points in 2018, though Mr. Trump captured the district by about 9 points in 2016.\u00a0 Rose's numbers continue a trend of strong fundraising for incumbent House Democrats. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos of Illinois told reporters earlier this month that the DCCC \"Frontline\" members, which are those in competitive districts, have raised more than $91 million this cycle. \"There's a lot of enthusiasm out there. Donald Trump is not only the best recruiter that House Democrats have ever seen, he's also the best fundraiser from House Democrats that we've ever seen,\" Bustos added. Meanwhile, Upstate New York Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney endorsed Vice President Joe Biden on Monday. IN THE HOUSE Another New York representative, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, brought in nearly $2 million in the fourth quarter and has nearly $3 million on hand. Ocasio-Cortez is not facing a competitive battle for re-election and is looking to use her fundraising power to help other candidates.\u00a0 Over the weekend, she\u00a0announced\u00a0the creation of her Courage to Change PAC to reward candidates \"who reject lobbyist money, fight for working families and welcome newcomers.\" It reportedly raised\u00a0$69,000\u00a0on its first day.\u00a0CBS news political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says the move to help fund other candidates comes as Fox News reported that Ocasio-Cortez is withholding $250,000 in dues to the DCCC because of its policy of not granting contracts to pollsters, specialists and strategists working with a Democratic primary challenger.\u00a0 \"I can choose not to fund that kind of exclusion,\" she tweeted. \"Expanding a House majority is critical, which is why I regularly (and happily) fundraise sizeable amounts for fellow members.\"",

            "article_content": "While most of President Trump's 2016 supporters were Republican base voters, for some, the decision to back him in 2016 came in the quiet of a voting booth or as the credits rolled on the final presidential debate. To win again, he must hang onto his previous supporters, including reluctant ones, and win over some who are undecided \u2014 all amid nationwide calls for racial justice and a global pandemic that has the U.S. economy reeling. \"If the election was tomorrow, I probably wouldn't even vote,\" Lori Jo Peters sighs into the phone. \"I'm just so confused. It feels like North is South. East is West. Up is down. Nothing is the way it used to be. Nothing is the way it should be,\" said the 56-year-old from Manheim, Pennsylvania. In 2016, her ballot for Mr. Trump was simply a \"vote against Hillary.\" Russell Dejulio calls his 2016 vote for Mr. Trump a \"tough, tough, tough call\" that he would never have made if Joe Biden had topped the ticket four years ago. But the 66-year-old retiree from Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, isn't so sure in 2020. \"I do have concerns about Joe Biden's dementia. I've just seen so many gaffes. And then I have to look at Harris as president. And I have a lot of questions with her.\" \"He got older, for one,\" observes retired Marine Corps veteran Ed Priv\u00e9 about Biden, whom he supported in 2008 and 2012, before switching to Mr. Trump in 2016. \"And he chose the wrong VP,\" he adds of Senator Kamala Harris. \"He should have stuck with someone more moderate.\" The 69-year-old from Franklin, New Hampshire, turned off the Democratic convention after hearing the 44th president rebuke the 45th. \"Former President Obama speaking ill of a sitting president \u2013 whether you agree or disagree with the guy \u2013 it just turned me off.\" Priv\u00e9 plans to vote for Mr. Trump again this year. In nine battleground states polled by CBS News since July, a majority of Mr. Trump's voters stand firmly behind him \u2013 between 58% and 76% of his '16 voters across these states both say their support is \"very strong\" and that they would never vote for Biden. Georgia and Arizona boast the highest numbers of firm Trump voters, with the lowest levels of support showing in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Florida. However, this cadre of unshakeable supporters alone can't carry Mr. Trump to victory in November. There aren't enough of them. In absolute terms, they've comprised only 22-29% of likely voters in our polling, depending on the state (see darker segments in each bar below). That's a large enough group to put a floor on the president's approval rating but not enough to win critical states again. To win, the Trump campaign must hang onto the small but significant proportion of his former voters now signaling they could vote Democratic. These softer supporters \u2014 who are backing Mr. Trump again but either say they don't support him very strongly or might consider Biden \u2014 have made up 15-25% of Mr. Trump's '16 voters, or 10-16% of all likely voters (lighter segments above). We've found more softer supporters in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Wisconsin \u2014 states that Mr. Trump won four years ago but now look very competitive. While some appear open to the president's messaging on the economy, they tend to view Biden as more compassionate and honest than Mr. Trump, offering reservations about the president's handling of coronavirus in particular. Another 2-8% of Trump's 2016 voters, depending on the state, are now unsure of how they'll vote.For Cheri Woelfl, a high school teacher from Milwaukee, her city's coronavirus outbreak prompted a different kind of hotspot. In the run-up to remote classes, public school officials scrambled to install supplementary Wi-Fi for her students struggling to connect online. The background noise, hard-to-hear video lessons, and lack of non-verbal cues worry the 51-year-old special needs instructor. She has mixed feelings about the Trump administration's job handling of COVID-19.\u00a0 \"Our country is probably the worst out of all countries in cases and deaths,\" she concedes. \"On the other hand, we had plentiful ventilators for people who might need it.\" Her tone flips again. \"But he didn't lead by good example by not wearing a mask at the beginning of the pandemic.\" For serial swing voter Scott Besenkamp, the White House's \"gung-ho daily briefings\" disappeared too quickly, long before the coronavirus. \"It is what it is. That's how they feel right now.\" The semi-retired former water maintenance worker gave up a part-time job restacking bowling pins after it became clear COVID-19 was not disappearing on its own.\u00a0 \"First, it was 'the summer will take care of it.' Well it's been worse in the summer than when it first started. We're in deep crap come winter,\" he grumbles. Voting for Joe Biden twice was easier years ago. \"I just don't know if he's up to it now.\" With debates fast approaching, the side-by-side comparison will offer the 77-year-old Biden his biggest stage after last week's Democratic convention, amid a socially distanced campaign with fewer campaign events than the traditional presidential bids.\u00a0 \"Biden has not been out in public very often,\" Peters remarks, though he also wonders about the GOP's portrayal of the stay-at-home candidate. \"I don't know if this presentation that the conservative side is bringing is accurate. Is he really in the beginning stages of dementia? Does he really not know how to think and speak for himself?\" But Mr. Trump's Twitter missive following Minneapolis man George Floyd's death \u2014 \"when the shooting starts the looting starts\" \u2014 left Peters, the mother of an adopted Black son, dispirited. \"I don't care if Kaepernick is taking a knee,\" she interjects. \"That's a peaceful protest.\" Even more threatening to Mr. Trump's reelection prospects than softer supporters are his former voters who are now rejecting him. These voters hurt him twice as much on a per capita basis than the 1-2% voting for third-party candidates, since he would not only lose their votes, his opponent would gain them. Across states, 3-7% of Trump 2016 voters have said they're voting for Biden. While these percentages may appear small, they have consistently outnumbered the 2-3% of Clinton '16 voters who now back Mr. Trump. In CBS News Battleground Tracker data collected in nine battleground states and nationwide, \"switchers\" differ from consistent Trump voters along demographic lines. Switchers are more likely to have college degrees. Like Trump's base, they are predominantly white, but they're disproportionately female. And they tend to live in denser, more populated areas than Trump voters overall do \u2014 the types of places that elected Democrats to Congress in 2018. Mary Kay Bennett, a life-long Republican who has never crossed the party line in a presidential election confesses she regrets her 2016 Trump vote \"every day,\" and dismisses Mr. Trump's belief that \"suburban housewives\" would support his dog whistles about low-income housing in their neighborhoods. No longer a member of the GOP, Bennett identified this way, now: \"I'm an educated, suburban, white woman who worked all of her life and raised her children by working and taking care of the house. To call me a suburban housewife?\" she pauses. \"And the Black community is going to encroach on my neighborhood? If Black people can afford my neighborhood, you're welcome to live next door to me.\" The retired health care worker quipped she'll be voting in pearl earrings, a dress, lipstick, and heels \u2026 for Joe Biden.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. Roman Catholic Church used a special and unprecedented exemption from federal rules to amass at least $1.4 billion in taxpayer-backed coronavirus aid, with many millions going to dioceses that have paid huge settlements or sought bankruptcy protection because of clergy sexual abuse cover-ups. The church's haul may have reached \u2014 or even exceeded \u2014 $3.5 billion, making a global religious institution with more than a billion followers among the biggest winners in the U.S. government's pandemic relief efforts, an Associated Press analysis of federal data released this week found. Houses of worship and faith-based organizations that promote religious beliefs aren't usually eligible for money from the U.S. Small Business Administration. But as the economy plummeted and jobless rates soared, Congress let faith groups and other nonprofits tap into the Paycheck Protection Program, a $659 billion fund created to keep main street open and Americans employed. By aggressively promoting the payroll program and marshaling resources to help affiliates navigate its shifting rules, Catholic dioceses, parishes, schools and other ministries have so far received approval for at least 3,500 forgivable loans, AP found. The Archdiocese of New York, for example, received 15 loans worth at least $28 million just for its top executive offices. Its iconic St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue was approved for at least $1 million. In Orange County, California, where a sparkling glass cathedral estimated to cost over $70 million recently opened, diocesan officials working at the complex received four loans worth at least $3 million. And elsewhere, a loan of at least $2 million went to the diocese covering Wheeling-Charleston, West Virginia, where a church investigation revealed last year that then-Bishop Michael Bransfield embezzled funds and made sexual advances toward young priests. Simply being eligible for low-interest loans was a new opportunity. But the church couldn't have been approved for so many loans \u2014 which the government will forgive if they are used for wage, rent and utilities \u2014 without a second break. Religious groups persuaded the Trump administration to free them from a rule that typically disqualifies an applicant with more than 500 workers. Without this preferential treatment, many Catholic dioceses would have been ineligible because \u2014 between their head offices, parishes and other affiliates \u2014 their employees exceed the 500-person cap. \"The government grants special dispensation, and that creates a kind of structural favoritism,\" said Micah Schwartzman, a University of Virginia law professor specializing in constitutional issues and religion who has studied the Paycheck Protection Program. \"And that favoritism was worth billions of dollars.\" The amount that the church collected, between $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion, is an undercount. The Diocesan Fiscal Management Conference, an organization of Catholic financial officers, surveyed members and reported that about 9,000 Catholic entities received loans. That is nearly three times the number of Catholic recipients the AP could identify. The AP couldn't find more Catholic beneficiaries because the government's data, released after pressure from Congress and a lawsuit from news outlets including the AP, didn't name recipients of loans under $150,000 \u2014 a category in which many smaller churches would fall. And because the government released only ranges of loan amounts, it wasn't possible to be more precise. Even without a full accounting, AP's analysis places the Catholic Church among the major beneficiaries in the Paycheck Protection Program, which also has helped companies backed by celebrities, billionaires, state governors and members of Congress. The program was open to all religious groups, and many took advantage. Evangelical advisers to President Donald Trump, including his White House spiritual czar, Paula White-Cain, also received loans. There is no doubt that state shelter-in-place orders disrupted houses of worship and businesses alike. Masses were canceled, even during the Holy Week and Easter holidays, depriving parishes of expected revenue and contributing to layoffs in some dioceses. Some families of Catholic school students are struggling to make tuition payments. And the expense of disinfecting classrooms once classes resume will put additional pressure on budgets. But other problems were self-inflicted. Long before the pandemic, scores of dioceses faced increasing financial pressure because of a dramatic rise in recent clergy sex abuse claims. The scandals that erupted in 2018 reverberated throughout the world. Pope Francis ordered the former archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to a life of \"prayer and penance\" following allegations he abused minors and adult seminarians. And a damning grand jury report about abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses revealed bishops had long covered for predator priests, spurring investigations in more than 20 other states. As the church again reckoned with its longtime crisis, abuse reports tripled during the year ending June 2019 to a total of nearly 4,500 nationally. Meanwhile, dioceses and religious orders shelled out $282 million that year \u2014 up from $106 million just five years earlier. Most of that went to settlements, in addition to legal fees and support for offending clergy. Loan recipients included about 40 dioceses that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few years paying victims through compensation funds or bankruptcy proceedings. AP's review found that these dioceses were approved for about $200 million, though the value is likely much higher. One was the New York Archdiocese. As a successful battle to lift the statute of limitations on the filing of child sexual abuse lawsuits gathered steam, Cardinal Timothy Dolan established a victim compensation fund in 2016. Since then, other dioceses have established similar funds, which offer victims relatively quick settlements while dissuading them from filing lawsuits. Spokesperson Joseph Zwilling said the archdiocese simply wanted to be \"treated equally and fairly under the law.\" When asked about the waiver from the 500-employee cap that religious organizations received, Zwilling deferred to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. A spokesperson for the bishops' conference acknowledged its officials lobbied for the paycheck program, but said the organization wasn't tracking what dioceses and Catholic agencies received. \"These loans are an essential lifeline to help faith-based organizations to stay afloat and continue serving those in need during this crisis,\" spokesperson Chieko Noguchi said in a written statement. According to AP's data analysis, the church and all its organizations reported retaining at least 407,900 jobs with the money they were awarded. Noguchi also wrote the conference felt strongly that \"the administration write and implement this emergency relief fairly for all applicants.\" Not every Catholic institution sought government loans. The Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy based in Stamford, Connecticut, told AP that even though its parishes experienced a decline in donations, none of the organizations in its five-state territory submitted applications. Deacon Steve Wisnowski, a financial officer for the eparchy, said pastors and church managers used their rainy-day savings and that parishioners responded generously with donations. As a result, parishes \"did not experience a severe financial crisis.\" Wisnowski said his superiors understood the program was for \"organizations and businesses truly in need of assistance.\" The law that created the Paycheck Protection Program let nonprofits participate, as long as they abided by SBA's \"affiliation rule.\" The rule typically says that only businesses with fewer than 500 employees, including at all subsidiaries, are eligible. Lobbying by the church helped religious organizations get an exception. The Catholic News Service reported that the bishops' conference and several major Catholic nonprofit agencies worked throughout the week of March 30 to ensure that the \"unique nature of the entities would not make them ineligible for the program\" because of how SBA defines a \"small\" business. Those conversations came just days after President Trump signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which included the Paycheck Protection Program. In addition, federal records show the Los Angeles archdiocese, whose leader heads the bishops' conference, paid $20,000 to lobby the U.S. Senate and House on \"eligibility for non-profits\" under the CARES Act. The records also show that Catholic Charities USA, a social service arm of the church with member agencies in dioceses across the country, paid another $30,000 to lobby on the act and other issues. In late April, after thousands of Catholic institutions had secured loans, several hundred Catholic leaders pressed for additional help on a call with President Trump. During the call, Trump underscored the coming presidential election and touted himself as the candidate best aligned with religious conservatives, boasting he was the \"best (president) the Catholic church has ever seen,\" according to Crux, an online publication that covers church-related news. The lobbying paid off. Catholic Charities USA and its member agencies were approved for about 110 loans worth between $90 million and $220 million at least, according to the data. In a statement, Catholic Charities said: \"Each organization is a separate legal entity under the auspices of the bishop in the diocese in which the agency is located. CCUSA supports agencies that choose to become members, but does not have any role in their daily operations or governance.\" The Los Angeles archdiocese told AP in a survey that reporters sent before the release of federal data that 247 of its 288 parishes \u2014 and all but one of its 232 schools \u2014 received loans. The survey covered more than 180 dioceses and eparchies. Like most dioceses, Los Angeles wouldn't disclose its total dollar amount. While the federal data doesn't link Catholic recipients to their home dioceses, AP found 37 loans to the archdiocese and its affiliates worth between $9 million and $23 million, including one for its downtown cathedral. In 2014, the archdiocese paid a record $660 million to settle sex abuse claims from more than 500 victims. Spokespeople for Los Angeles Archbishop Jose M. Gomez did not respond to additional questions about the archdiocese's finances and lobbying. In program materials, SBA officials said they provided the affiliation waiver to religious groups in deference to their unique organizational structure, and because the public health response to slow the coronavirus' spread disrupted churches just as it did businesses. SBA did not respond to written questions and requests for comment. Meanwhile, some legal experts say that the special consideration the government gave faith groups in the loan program has further eroded the wall between church and state provided in the First Amendment. With that erosion, religious groups that don't pay taxes have gained more access to public money, said Marci Hamilton, a University of Pennsylvania professor and attorney who has represented clergy abuse victims on constitutional issues during bankruptcy proceedings. \"At this point, the argument is you're anti-religious if in fact you would say the Catholic Church shouldn't be getting government funding,\" Hamilton said. After its lobbying blitz, the Catholic Church worked with parishes and schools to access the money. Many dioceses \u2014 from large ones such as the Archdiocese of Boston to smaller ones such as the Diocese of La Crosse, Wisconsin \u2014 assembled how-to guides to help their affiliates apply. The national Catholic fiscal conference also hosted multiple webinars with legal and financial experts to help coach along local leaders. Federal data show that the bulk of the church's money was approved during the loan program's first two weeks. That's when demand for the first-come, first-served assistance was so high that the initial $349 billion was quickly exhausted, shutting out many local businesses. Overall, nearly 500 loans approved to Catholic entities exceeded $1 million each. The AP found that at least eight hit the maximum range of $5 million to $10 million. Many of the listed recipients were the offices of bishops, headquarters of leading religious orders, major churches, schools and chapters of Catholic Charities. Also among recipients was the Saint Luke Institute. The Catholic treatment center for priests accused of sexual abuse and those suffering from other disorders received a loan ranging from $350,000 to $1 million. Based in Silver Spring, Maryland, the institute has at times been a way station for priests accused of sexual abuse who returned to active ministry only to abuse again. Perhaps nothing illustrates the church's aggressive pursuit of funds better than four dioceses that sued the federal government to receive loans, even though they entered bankruptcy proceedings due to mounting clergy sex-abuse claims. Small Business Administration rules prohibit loans to applicants in bankruptcy. The Archdiocese of Santa Fe, New Mexico \u2014 once home to a now-closed and notorious treatment center for predator priests \u2014 prevailed in court, clearing the way for its administrative offices to receive nearly $1 million. It accused the SBA of overreaching by blocking bankruptcy applications when Congress didn't spell that out. Yet even when a diocese has lost in bankruptcy court, or its case is pending, its affiliated parishes, schools and other organizations remain eligible for loans. On the U.S. territory of Guam, well over 200 clergy abuse lawsuits led church leaders in the tiny Archdiocese of Agana to seek bankruptcy protection, as they estimated at least $45 million in liabilities. Even so, the archdiocese's parishes, schools and other organizations have received at least $1.7 million as it sues the SBA for approval to get a loan for its headquarters, according to bankruptcy filings. The U.S. church may have a troubling record on sex abuse, but Bishop Lawrence Persico of Erie, Pennsylvania, pushed back on the idea that dioceses should be excluded from the government's rescue package. Approximately 80 organizations within his diocese received loans worth $10.3 million, the diocese said, with most of the money going to parishes and schools. Persico pointed out that church entities help feed, clothe and shelter the poor \u2014 and in doing so keep people employed. \"I know some people may react with surprise that government funding helped support faith-based schools, parishes and dioceses,\" he said. \"The separation of church and state does not mean that those motivated by their faith have no place in the public square.\"",

            "article_content": "More than a dozen Democratic House incumbents and several Senate candidates in competitive races have yet to endorse Joe Biden, nearly a month after the former vice president became his party's presumptive presidential nominee. The holdouts underscore challenges facing Biden as he prepares to lead a party fighting to defend a House majority and win back the Senate.\u00a0 Some candidates who have yet to formally endorse Biden include Representatives Tom O'Halleran of Arizona, T.J. Cox of California, Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Lauren Underwood of Illinois, Jared Golden of Maine, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico, Susie Lee of Nevada, Antonio Delgado of New York, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ben McAdams of Utah and Kim Schrier of Washington state. All are members of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's (DCCC) \"Frontline\" program to buoy members in \"tough seats.\"\u00a0 \"Joe Biden was able to go into many of those [Trump] districts and campaign with these new members of Congress and help get them across the finish line,\" Congressman Ami Bera of California told CBS News. Bera, who co-chairs the DCCC program for vulnerable House Democrats, was a key surrogate stumping for Biden in the race's early contests. Bera expects all House Democrats to eventually line up behind Biden, chalking up the holdouts to a \"matter of timing.\" \"I think all of us feel that Vice President Biden has long coattails. His policies, his leadership experience are going to be a sharp contrast with President Trump and in this presidential election that contrast is going to matter, but also at the congressional level,\" said Bera. The former vice president's \"coattails\" have long been a central focus of his campaign. As the race narrowed, some warned that competitors \u2014 like Bernie Sanders \u2014 posed a risk to incumbents in uphill reelection bids. At a campaign stop in January in Nevada, home to two potentially vulnerable incumbents, Biden highlighted the importance of the Democratic nominee leading down-ballot races.\u00a0 \"It's not just whether or not the person you pick as the nominee can win. It's whether or not that person you pick as the nominee can bring along a Democratic Senate. We need to win back the Senate like we won back the House last time,\" Biden said.\u00a0 And when Biden received the endorsements of former rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke on March 3, O'Rourke in a fundraising email specifically highlighted down-ballot races, writing \"having him at the top of the ticket will help our down-ballot candidates, especially in Texas.\"\u00a0   The most vulnerable incumbent Democrats in the Senate have all endorsed Biden, but several waited until Sanders dropped out to do so. Senators Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan endorsed the vice president in mid-April.\u00a0 There is no more heavily targeted incumbent Democratic senator than Doug Jones in Alabama, and he endorsed Biden the day Biden launched his campaign. Jones has told\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0he expects to campaign with Biden this fall.\u00a0 Several candidates challenging incumbent Republicans in battleground states have yet to officially endorse Biden. Those candidates include John Hickenlooper in Colorado, Cal Cunningham in North Carolina, MJ Hegar in Texas and Raphael Warnock in Georgia. \u00a0 Most of the 13 vulnerable House members refrained from endorsing anyone during the heat of the presidential primary. Three \u2014\u00a0McAdams,\u00a0Rose, and\u00a0McBath\u00a0\u2014 backed Michael Bloomberg before picking Biden. Hayes endorsed Senator Kamala Harris\u00a0in July. Golden supported Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado\u00a0days before\u00a0the New Hampshire primary.\u00a0 Dan Sera, who led Democrats' efforts to flip the House in 2018, said some races benefit from making a reelection argument that doesn't ride on the presidential race. \"Remember, this crop of people was viewed as incredibly independent from the Democratic party,\" Sera said about the freshman House Democrat class. \"I think there are places where you have to ask, what else is going on politically?\" Horn's campaign said that she will most likely vote for Biden, but is also looking to replicate the surprise success House Democrats saw in 2018 by keeping the races hyper-local. In 2018, Horn pulled off the upset against Republican Steve Russell, winning by less than a one-point margin.\u00a0 \"I don't think we get anything out of [endorsing], I don't think they get anything out of it. We're not going to run from the nominee at all, but we're not going to lead with that either,\" a source close to the Horn campaign said. \u00a0 Republicans have been aggressive about trying to tie targeted Democrats to the national race, and, more recently, to an\u00a0allegation of sexual assault\u00a0against Biden, which Biden has denied. While many Republicans have not necessarily indicated they think the accusation has merit, they have attacked Democrats for using what they say is a different standard than was used for allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee targeted House Democrats and candidates for either their silence on the issue or their past comments during the Kavanaugh hearings.\u00a0 \"I think in a very real way, Democrats have to answer for it. Because we saw, I know how Democrats used the Kavanaugh allegations every single day. And they have painted themselves in a corner with their own hypocrisy,\" former NRCC communications director Matt Gorman said.\u00a0 One of Biden's earlier endorsers, Congresswoman Dina Titus of Nevada, said she didn't think the allegations would have an impact on down ballot competitive races. Like other comments from top Democrats, she showed support for the overall #MeToo movement while pointing to Biden's overall record on legislation like the Violence Against Women Act. \"Every woman needs to tell her story and have it vetted. And I believe it's been thoroughly vetted by The New York Times and other press,\" she told CBS News.\u00a0 Since early on in the cycle, Republicans have also been using the larger debate about socialism during the presidential primary to target vulnerable House Democrats. \"They're going to be tied to the national ticket. And they're going to have to own the radical socialist policies that Joe Biden got from Bernie Sanders and has largely endorsed,\"\u00a0 NRCC spokesperson Michael McAdams said. Cunningham, who flipped South Carolina's first congressional district in 2018, was\u00a0vocal\u00a0about his opposition to some of Sanders' policies during the primary. He has not endorsed Biden but a campaign spokesperson said Cunningham voted for Biden in his state's primary and plans to do the same in the general election. \"If people want to take that as an endorsement, they can take it as an endorsement. But right now, he's focused on helping constituents get through the pandemic, not on the presidential race,\" a Cunningham campaign spokesperson told CBS News. But with the outbreak slowing the pace of the campaign and the party's nominating convention still months away, some Democrats also see an opportunity for Biden to grow his down-ballot efforts. \"You know one thing about having\u00a0a presumptive nominee relatively early in the cycle, it's really giving Joe Biden the gift of time to unite the party and begin building a strong general election operation,\" says Tori Taylor, Swing Left's chief political officer.\u00a0 The liberal organizing group has ramped up its virtual resources amid the pandemic, which include efforts banking on presidential and Senate wins. \"There are going to be millions and millions of dollars deployed on all sides in this election. When we have this time and the ability to really work together as a party and as a progressive movement, that's when we're able to deploy and organize those resources in the most strategic ways,\" Taylor added.",

            "article_content": "There's a trade war raging between the top two Democratic presidential contenders. Since Super Tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, Bernie Sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and opponent Joe Biden disagree. Trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men fight for delegates in the industrial Midwest.\u00a0 Though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in Michigan on Tuesday or next week in Ohio could signal how the Democratic Party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda. Across one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, Sanders has been taking swipes at Biden's positions on trade. He slammed then-Senator Biden's support of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated most tariffs between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and the 2000 China Trade Bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (PNTR) with China. Sanders voted against both measures as a House member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a Sanders\u00a0ad, \"Decimated,\" that's up in every March 10th and March 17th primary state. \"If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements,\" Sanders told a Detroit crowd Friday. This playbook may seem familiar to Democrats, since Sanders waged a similar campaign against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries in Michigan. He skewered her at a Democratic debate held in Flint, Michigan, two days before the primary. \"Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. NAFTA, supported by the Secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs,\" he said at the time. The argument helped Sanders eke out a win over Clinton in the Great Lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. Later, Donald Trump, too, consistently criticized Clinton over NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u00a0 Sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character.\u00a0 \"I worked with the unions as a member of the House of Representative to defeat NAFTA and to defeat PNTR with China. I can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in Montpellier, Vermont in opposition to NAFTA. I knew what it was gonna do. I knew that you cannot ask American workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in Mexico,\" Sanders said Friday in Detroit. The senator hit the same note during campaign stops in Michigan over weekend.\u00a0 He said in Flint Saturday, \"I heard, during that period in the '90s, I heard all of corporate America say, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' And all of the media said, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' I stood with the unions, the working families of this country; I voted against those agreements! Joe Biden voted for those agreements.\" The reviews of NAFTA are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after Canada ratifies it. In 2013, the liberal think tank\u00a0Economic Policy Institute\u00a0projected that NAFTA caused, \"20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power.\" At the same time,\u00a0Foreign Affairs\u00a0estimates that 14 millions American jobs still depend on NAFTA. And a 2016 report from the\u00a0U.S. International Trade Commission\u00a0concluded the policy, \"had essentially no effect on real wages in the United States of either skilled or unskilled workers.\" Biden has rarely brought up North American trade policy on the stump since the Iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with China. Instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of U.S. production to cheaper alternatives in Mexico, as\u00a0General Motors\u00a0did in March 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in Ohio alone.\u00a0 He stands by his NAFTA vote, arguing that \"no, it wasn't\" a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last May in Iowa. He has labeled himself a \"fair trader,\" rather than a \"free trader.\" \"We should treat other countries in a way they treat us,\" Biden said, \"Just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more.\" The most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the USMCA agreement, an idea Barack Obama pitched\u00a0in the 2008\u00a0primary. Biden said in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told CBS News last summer he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed \"from the beginning\" of the NAFTA negotiation in the '90s.\u00a0 Sanders\u00a0unapologetically\u00a0voted against USMCA, stating that protections did not go far enough.\u00a0 On this matter Sanders stood alone. His one-time Democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. Elizabeth Warren, Sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the USMCA and bargain for a better deal if elected. \u00a0 The distinction was noted by some in the Rust Belt.\u00a0 Frank Hammer, a retired 32-year General Motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with Sanders Friday in Detroit. \"You were the singular, sole [candidate] that said \u2014 consistent with your past positions \u2014 that you were opposed to [USMCA] and I think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers,\" Hammer said. \"And I'm so grateful. Thank you.\"\u00a0 On the trail Biden has dismissed China's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges Chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the U.S. dominance in the future. \"The idea that China is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre,\" he said in Iowa in late January, suggesting that rather than viewing China as an existential threat, the U.S. could help China with some of its problems. The U.S. \"can compete with China and insist that they follow the rules,\" he proposed. Unlike the\u00a0Social Security ads\u00a0the Biden campaign is running in Michigan, two Biden advisers tell CBS News after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage Sanders on the intra-party trade war.\u00a0 \"At this point I'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis,\" one Biden adviser told CBS News, \"They're looking for a nominee.\" Others agree that focusing on trade\u2014even in Michigan\u2014may not be as beneficial as Sanders hopes. \"I think it's a miscalculation from Sanders,\" Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, told CBS News, citing a\u00a0Gallup\u00a0poll that shows 67% of self-described Democrats say that NAFTA has been beneficial for the United States. Wolfers said that with the election of President Trump \"everything is a little upside down\" in terms of trade politics because the GOP incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any Democratic nominee is likely to make. \"Relatively speaking, Democrats are now the pro-trade party,\" Wolfers added. Biden has a strong argument to make in Michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the Obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big U.S. automakers, General Motors and Chrysler.\u00a0 \"Just like the automobile industry came back, Detroit is going to come back,\" Biden said\u00a0in 2014. \"It's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. It symbolizes the manufacturing might of the United States of America.\" According to an invitation\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CBS News, Biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in Michigan this week, co-hosted by Cynthia and Edsel Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford.

            "article_content": "Americans are putting a priority on health concerns over economic ones as the coronavirus continues to keep businesses closed across the country. Right now,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0Eleanor Watson\u00a0say U.S. leaders are grappling with how to reopen parts of the country, but according to the latest\u00a0CBS News polling, 63% of Americans are worried about opening too fast and the outbreak worsening, while just 37% worry about the economy opening too slowly and the economy growing worse. And even as the president urges opening up the country in phases, 47% of Republicans believe the governors should decide when states reopen and only 37% believe the president should decide.\u00a0 Both Republicans and Democrats approve of how governors are handling the crisis in their states, however, more Democrats than Republicans are proud of governors, and far more Republicans (73%) are proud of Mr. Trump's response to the outbreak than of the governors' response generally.\u00a0 Views of Mr. Trump's overall handling of the coronavirus outbreak have changed very little in the past few weeks. The newest polling has his approval at 48% compared to 47% two weeks ago.\u00a0 When it comes to campaigning for the general election, candidates might have to wait awhile before drumming up support at rallies. According to the latest poll, voters in both parties are hesitant to return to public places before the outbreak is over. Only 13% of all voters say they would definitely return to public places over the next few weeks if restrictions were lifted right now. Forty-eight percent of voters would not return to public places until they were confident the outbreak is over, and 39% said they would \"maybe\" return if they saw the outbreak getting better.\u00a0 At the same time, among places Americans said they would be willing to go should stay-at-home orders be lifted, only 13% said they would be comfortable at a large sporting or entertainment event, 15% said they'd be comfortable getting on an airplane and only 29% said they would be comfortable going to a bar or restaurant.\u00a0 This comes as multiple protests against stay-at-home orders have taken place at state capitals across the country. According to the polling, only 23% of Americans support the protests, while 62% oppose them. Among those who oppose them are 82% of Democrats, 62% of Independents and 46% of Republicans (more than the 43 percent that support them). Additionally, only 13% of Republicans believe the president should encourage them; the majority of Republicans believe he should either discourage them or not say anything at all. \u00a0 Though 70% of Americans saying staying home and stopping the spread of the virus should be the top priority, many Americans are already feeling an impact on their finances. According to the polling, 36% are already feeling the financial effect, while 41% say it will affect their finances in a few weeks or longer. Only 17% said it would not impact their finances.\u00a0 To that end, the public overwhelmingly approves \u2013 88 to 12% \u2013 of Congress passing additional legislation to help small businesses. Right now, the majority of Democrats and independents believe the federal funding is mostly going to large businesses while Republicans are split. Sixty-one percent of Americans believe Congress should immediately return to Washington to deal with the outbreak while just 39% do not. No matter what happens, when this is all said and done,\u00a0 54% of Americans believe life in American will be permanently changed after the coronavirus. Forty-six percent believe there will be an eventual return to normal. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Beyond the Trump administration's public health response to COVID-19, Joe Biden is also tailoring criticism toward the president's handling of the economic side effects, alleging Mr. Trump is unable to manage the sudden financial crisis millions of Americans find themselves in,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 After the new unemployment numbers today, Biden said in a statement, \"Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis \u2013 and Donald Trump isn't doing enough for them.\"\u00a0 While the president pushes state leaders to find ways to allow some businesses to reopen when deemed safe, Biden says businesses should remain closed in unsafe areas. In order to keep employees of these closed businesses on the payroll, he advocates for nationwide work-sharing structures. Looking ahead, by drawing attention to the economic crisis associated with the pandemic, Biden lays the groundwork to highlight the likely financial strains many Americans will be under later this year even if the risk to their physical health subsides.\u00a0 On the primary trail, Biden was frequently critical of Mr. Trump's boasts of the once-booming economy as he said the Obama-Biden administration set the economic growth in motion. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP The Trump campaign launched its 2020 campaign app designed to ramp up voter engagement and data collection ahead of the November election.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the latest development in the campaign's online recalibration offers supporters opportunities to phone bank, register voters or host a meet-up for Team Trump.\u00a0 Also up for grabs? Rewards. Similar to a video game, participants can earn points for helping to expand the campaign's digital footprint \u2013 share a Trump tweet to win one point. Convince a neighbor to download the app for one hundred points. Individuals earning 5,000 points earn a campaign store discount, while 100,000 points gets you a picture with the president himself. The app has been in the works\u00a0for over a year.\u00a0The campaign began testing the app in January, with plans to deploy the digital tool at a smaller \"Keep America Great\" rally. Yet with the coronavirus pandemic putting a pause on all campaign rallies, the application has been retooled to promote virtual events and was announced\u00a0via Twitter. Separately the Trump campaign is pushing for the removal of a Democratic Super PAC ad on a local station in Michigan. According to a cease and desist letter sent to the station in Grand Rapids provided by the American Bridge PAC,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports the campaign is demanding that they stop airing the ad titled \"Trust\" which takes on the president's response to the coronavirus and China.\u00a0 The letter reads in part, \"The AB PAC ad's central premise is based on the deliberately false, misleading, and deceptive claim that, 'Trump sent seventeen tons of American masks and medical supplies to China. Our masks and supplies.' This allegation is materially misleading and is willfully blind to the most basic context.\"\u00a0 On February 7, the State Department did announce it was\u00a0facilitating\u00a0the transport of \"nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\"\u00a0 According to the State Department, those supplies were \"donated by the American people.\" This is not the first time the Trump campaign has sent a cease and desist letter to a television station over a Super PAC ad in the 2020 campaign cycle. On April 13, the Trump campaign announced it was suing a station in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, for carrying an ad by Priorities USA that was airing in battleground states which slammed Trump's coronavirus response.\u00a0 The Trump campaign claims it manipulated audio clips to create an entirely new sentence. When the Trump campaign first sent a cease and desist letter to the station over that ad in March, Priorities USA responded by expanding its ad buy. VEEPSTAKES STACEY ABRAMS Stacey Abrams went further in depth today on why she would be a strong running mate for Joe Biden, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. During a live-streamed chat with Color for Change, a civil rights 501(c)(4), Abrams gave a blow-by-blow explanation of her credentials. Abrams said that she must be direct with her ambition or else, as an African-American, she would be discounted.\u00a0 \"As a person of color I cannot be shy about my response because any hint that I don't think I'm qualified, that I don't think we can, is used as a justification for saying that we can't,\" she said. Abrams went on: \"This isn't about ambition for me, it's about ambition for our people \u00a0\u2013 that we should be considered and should be elevated to a place where we can help represent and serve our communities.\"\u00a0 She also discussed her philosophy for winning in November. Abrams acknowledged the need to win in the Midwest working class areas, but contended that she would help galvanize voters in more urban areas.\u00a0 \"We have to win those blue wall states but we also have to expand the map because we keep \u2013 if we keep playing the last election while the other side is running the next election, we will continue to fall behind,\" she said. \"And the thing is we need someone who can not only win Saginaw and Racine, and Scranton, we need to win Detroit and Milwaukee and Philadelphia.\" AMY KLOBUCHAR While her name is being floated as a running mate for Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, in a round of media appearances, continued her November focus on how to keep elections safe in the post-pandemic era,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \u00a0As scientific debate continues on whether public gatherings later this fall will be safe or not, the Minnesota senator is leading a push for greater financial support to states considering greater absentee voting measures.\u00a0 \"People should not have to make a decision between voting and their health,\" Klobuchar said, stating there is bipartisan support for both granting financial assistance for states to implement more vote by mail opportunities and initiating an extension of early in-person voting to limit congregation on Election Day. In one of her appearances Thursday, Klobuchar joined Rock the Vote along with When We All Vote, a nonpartisan initiative by former First Lady Michelle Obama, on a call to push for federal legislation to expand mail-in voting.\u00a0 \"We cannot even be certain where students are going to be on Election Day,\" said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden. \"We want to COVID-proof the election in America.\" Wyden and Klobuchar have introduced a bill to expand no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail, early-in-person voting and reimburse states for election-related costs during the pandemic.\u00a0 Klobuchar told\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0Democratic senators have sent a letter to congressional leaders calling for $3.6 billion to be included in a fourth coronavirus aid package.\u00a0 \"That is a realistic number for what we need and we're just going to negotiate everything we can,\" Klobuchar said to CBS News. She also touted the bill during an Instagram live chat with When We All Vote co-chair Valerie Jarrett. It was hosted by the nonprofit organization, The United State of Women. \"This doesn't have anything to do with who wins but it has everything to do with making the voters safe,\" Klobuchar told Jarrett. ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday that her oldest brother, Don Reed Herring, had died from coronavirus. \"I'm grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him, but it's hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say 'I love you' one more time\u2014and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close,\" she tweeted.\u00a0 Herring, who was 86 and lived in Oklahoma, died on Tuesday, Warren said. A long-time military man who fought in Vietnam and a lifelong Republican,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says he had been a fixture in the progressive senator's presidential campaign stump speech. \"I mentioned my three brothers. One is a Democrat. Do the math,\" Warren frequently told voters asking her how she'd bridge the partisan divide. \"But here's the thing: I think about the things that unite us.\"\u00a0 GRETCHEN WHITMER Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer commented in a CNN interview Thursday morning on speculation that she is on a shortlist to become Joe Biden's running mate. Asked if the state of Michigan can spare losing its governor during the coronavirus pandemic to campaign,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Whitmer responded, \"The job that I want is the one that I have. I worked for two years to become the governor of the state of Michigan.\"\u00a0 In a separate interview on MSNBC, Whitmer criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's comment that he is in \"favor of allowing states\" to go bankrupt. McConnell made the comment in an interview with Hugh Hewitt. \"I was really disappointed to see Senator McConnell's comments about letting states go bankrupt,\" Whitmer said. \"I just think that it's incredibly irresponsible.\" GOVERNOR'S MANSION HELP WANTED Governors across the political spectrum are continuing to speak up about the need for federal funding as they deal with the pandemic's brutal impact on their state budgets, says\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 Most states are expecting to see a substantial loss in tax revenue due to the economic downturn, and some are already acknowledging the incoming budget cuts to come. Republican Governor Kristi Noem said that while her state has always been a \"really thrifty state,\" they'll be seeing a substantial tax revenue loss. \"All I really want to do is make sure that I don't have to slash teacher funding, to make sure that I don't have to slash highway maintenance,\" she said.\u00a0 \"I don't want to have to cut funding for nursing homes. But that is situation that they are putting me in. Now that is not conservative.\" In response to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's suggestion that bankruptcy be an option for states with decimated budgets and that there shouldn't be any \"blue state bailouts,\" New York Governor Cuomo said it was \"one of the really dumb ideas of all time\u2026The entire nation is dependent on what the governors do to reopen. But then you're not going to fund the state government? You think I'm going to do it alone? How do you think this is going to work?\" Cuomo said Thursday. \"'I mean for crying out loud. If there's ever a time to stop your obsessive political bias and anger...now is the time.\" The decimating of state budgets comes as states continue to extend their stay-at-home orders, while also working through how they can reopen their economies. A new\u00a0roadmap\u00a0by the National Governors Association hopes to help states out with that, though it warns that the sufficient amount of resources needed, such as testing and PPE supplies, may not be there yet.\u00a0 The report observes that testing capacity in the U.S. remains \"inadequate\" to move forward, despite repeated assurances from the White House that the U.S. has enough testing for states that meet other criteria to begin to reopen,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News digital political reporter Kathryn Watson.\u00a0\"Opening prematurely \u2014 or opening without the tools in place to rapidly identify and stop the spread of the virus \u2014 could send states back into crisis mode, push health systems past capacity, and force states back into strict social distancing measures,\" the report reads.\u00a0 ISSUES THAT MATTER JOBS Another 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance for the week ending April 18, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to roil the U.S. job market. Over the past five weeks, since businesses around the country began closing due to the virus,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0notes about 26.5 million workers have filed jobless claims. The weekly number reported on Thursday is the fourth highest ever recorded by the Labor Department, but it is a drop from the 5.2 million claims for the week ending April 11.\u00a0 More than 6 million people filed claims in the weeks ending April 4 and March 28. The advance number of continuing claims for the week ending April 11 is just under 16 million. That indicates how many people are actually receiving unemployment benefits. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the previous weekly high for continuing claims was 6.6 million people in May 2009. Those numbers are all seasonally adjusted, which \"attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns\" to show how employment levels change over time. The unadjusted numbers show that more than 24.3 million workers have filed claims the past five weeks. That dwarfs previous five week stretches, according to Heidi Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Labor Department from 2014-2017 during the Obama administration and is now with the Economic Policy Institute.\u00a0 \"In the period before the coronavirus hit, just over a million workers would apply for UI in a typical five-week span, and in the worst five-week stretch of the Great Recession, it was less than four million,\" Shierholz wrote in a\u00a0blog post. She says more than 1 in 7 workers have lost jobs based on the unadjusted jobless numbers. Shierholz also estimates that about 71% of people who have filed for unemployment between March 14 and April 11 are receiving their benefits. \u00a0 PRIMARILY CONCERNED KANSAS Tomorrow is the deadline for registered voters in Kansas to request a mail-in ballot for the Democratic primary in that state, which was originally scheduled for May 2. While Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says all formally filed candidates will remain on the ballot and voters can still choose to vote their preference on their ranked-choice ballots. Any candidates that reaches the 15% viability will be awarded Kansas delegates.\u00a0 Earlier this month, after Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race, Kansas Democratic Party Chair Vicki Hiatt urged voters to still participate during the vote by mail primary.\u00a0 \"If we want to make sure voters have the option to vote-by-mail in future elections, especially for the November general election if the COVID-19 virus has not been contained, Kansas must prove that vote-by-mail keeps our communities safe and makes our democracy stronger.\"\u00a0 In late March, the KDP and the Democratic National Committee moved forward with a plan to conduct the primary completely by mail in an effort to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The KDP sent out more than 370,000 ballots to registered Democrats in the state.\u00a0 CAMPAIGN STRATEGY BATTLEGROUND ORGANIZING Organizing Together 2020, an independent campaign coalition made up of presidential campaign alumni, is working with two new partners to jumpstart their presence and work in battleground states. The Congressional Black Caucus PAC and Giffords gun safety group will be working with the organization to build up and train campaign volunteers in six states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The new partnerships add to OT2020's roster of labor unions and progressive groups that they're working with through the election. Giffords political director Joanna Belanger told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that OT2020 will serve as a \"one-stop shop\" for volunteers to learn the information and messaging on everything from gun violence to education to campaign finance reform.\u00a0 \"What they're doing is super important,\" she said. \"Making sure voters, in key swing states that will decide the election, understand what's at stake and who they should be voting for.\"\u00a0 The CBC PAC says OT2020 will also help with informing voters on how to cast their ballots, especially as more elections push the use of absentee and mail ballots. The PAC's political director, Niccara Campbell, said current CBC members will also be made available to support and energize volunteers.\u00a0 \"Whether it be cheering on as a surrogate to get everyone together, to lend their voices, to get everyone pepped up and ready to go \u2013 anything in that realm, that's exactly what they'll be lending their voice to,\" she said.\u00a0 While OT2020 said it's already planning to do a lot of digital work, the group has adapted to the pandemic by honing in on text-messaging mobilization and using Zoom to connect with volunteers. OT2020 National communications director Geoff Burgan told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0while lots of Democrats had multiple favorite candidates in mind during the primaries, \"the overriding thing for so many of them was, 'How do I defeat Donald Trump and his policies?' 'How do I get started on that today?' That's going to be the point across the groups, so many of our members want to get their organizing started as soon as they can,\" he added.",

            "article_content": "In a surprising announcement Thursday, President Trump said the portion of the Republican National Convention taking place in Jacksonville, Florida, where he was set to deliver a speech accepting the GOP nomination, is cancelled. Citing a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in that state, President Trump said \"the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what has happened recently, the flare-up in Florida, to have a big convention is not the right time.\"\u00a0 The president said he \"felt it was wrong\" to have people going to a hot spot, adding that he \"didn't want to take any chances.\" President Trump said \"safety, just safety\" was his main concern even though his advisers told him it would be possible to hold a safe and responsible convention. \"It's a different world and it will be for a while,\" the president added.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said it was important for him to set an example by cancelling his big convention speech. \"We also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important. It's hard for us to say we are going to have a lot of people packed in a room, and then other people couldn't do it,\" President Trump said. \"There is nothing more crowded than a convention,\" he added.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports the decision to cancel is a big turn for the president who\u00a0earlier this summer demanded\u00a0a convention with \"a crowd-like setting\" without social distancing or face masks. It was one of the main reasons the Republican National Committee moved significant parts of the nominating convention from Charlotte to Jacksonville. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, would not promise to allow thousands of delegates and attendees into the Spectrum Arena for the celebration.\u00a0 But Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, immediately offered his state as a place to hold the convention. The official business of the convention, which was set to take place in Charlotte, will still go on in North Carolina, President Trump said. RNC delegates will still meet in Charlotte and conduct the nominating process, virtual rallies, and other party business there. But there will be no big, splashy acceptance speech from Mr. Trump. \"I'll still do a convention speech in a different form,\" President Trump said. \"But we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It is just not the right time for that.\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that Republican and Democrats are weighing in. The Trump campaign released a statement Thursday applauding the president for putting \"the health and safety of the American people first\" by calling off the convention. \"The President has built the most innovative political campaign in history and will provide exciting, informative, and enthusiastic programming so Republicans can celebrate the re-nomination of President Trump and Vice President Pence,\" said Trump Campaign Manager Bill Stepien. \"We look forward to celebrating the historic achievements of the administration and exposing what Joe Biden is \u2013 the empty vessel, Trojan Horse candidate used by the extreme left to advance their radical agenda.\"\u00a0 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a tweet that the president is \"focused on leading the American people during this unprecedented crisis.\" She added in a tweet, \"His number one priority in this decision was the safety of the people of Jacksonville, the convention attendees, and all of the American people.\" The Jacksonville 2020 Host Committee said in a statement that the president \"made the absolute right decision for the health and safety of the people of Jacksonville and of the entire state of Florida\" by calling off the event. \"The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Florida is serious and the President and the RNC have demonstrated great concern for the safety of all Floridians,\" said the Host Committee. In an interview with\u00a0Mitchell, Republican Party of Florida Chairman Joe Gruters said that while he thinks the convention could have been hosted safely and people were still pushing for the event to take place, he thinks the president ultimately made the best decision. \"We were gonna throw him the biggest party that the Florida has ever seen and we were gonna make it a memorable experience for everybody,\" said Gruters. \"It's somewhat disappointing but I understand because we're dealing with this crisis, that we have to be amenable to changes\u2026I think it was a selfless act by the President to call it off and we'll move forward and we're on the way to victory.\" In a joint statement, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and Duval County Sheriff Mike Williams \u2014 who recently\u00a0expressed\u00a0significant concerns about the viability of the convention \u2014 said they appreciate the president's consideration of public health. \"We appreciate President Donald Trump considering our public health and safety concerns in making this incredibly difficult decision,\" said Curry and Williams. \"As always, in Jacksonville, public safety is our number one priority.\u00a0 President Trump has once again reaffirmed his commitment to the safety of Jacksonville Florida and the people of the United States of America.\"\u00a0Political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0notes that at least five Republican senators in recent weeks said they were not going to attend the convention, and others expressed concern about having an event where coronavirus cases were spiking. CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports that Democratic Party officials say their party made this decision weeks ago and that because of their earlier choice to scale back, they have a head start. \"...I wonder who will have the better convention \u2013 the party who recognized the limitations early on and have been planning for a mostly virtual/digital television production to capitalize on a prime time audience of millions,\" posed one Democratic strategist involved in convention planning. \"Or the clowns who keep moving theirs from place to place and have no concrete plan a month out.\" Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo said in a statement she's glad the president \"took his head out of the sand long enough to realize what a predictable, preventable disaster he was about to inflict on the city of Jacksonville.\" Rizzo added, \"His ego-driven political stunt has wasted precious time and resources during a pandemic, and Floridians will remember his reckless leadership in November.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN The campaign-produced conversation between Joe Biden and Barack Obama on Thursday featured a broad look at Biden's presidential candidacy, pointing out differences in healthcare and economic policy regarding the pandemic with the Trump administration and also painting a character contrast with the president,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \u00a0 The fifteen-minute discussion was broadcast to Mr. Obama's large social media following and has the opportunity to reach Americans who may now be tuning in to the presidential election a little more than 100 days away. Mr. Obama's key focus was serving as a character witness for Biden. The 44th president said he is confident in a potential Biden administration because they will \"send a signal of decency and regard and concern and community around the country.\" Mr. Obama said \"for all the specific policies that we are going to need\" to address the pandemic \"more than anything, it is just that basic decency and an understanding of what's best in America that I think people are going to be hungry for.\"\u00a0 On approaching the pandemic with policy, Mr. Obama asserted \"you can't separate out the public health crisis from the economy. If you want the economy growing again people have to feel safe.\" Advocating for Biden's proposed \"public option\" healthcare plan, which would offer Americans the choice to opt-in to a Medicare-like plan, Mr. Obama said this is within reach because his administration passed the \"starter house\" version: the Affordable Care Act. \"You know what it's like as much as anybody to be in the White House during crisis. You know what it's like to have to get laws passed through Congress, you know what it's like to deal with foreign leaders, you know what it's like \u2014 and how lonely it can be \u2014 to make tough decisions where not every decision is going to be perfect but you gotta make 'em,\" Mr. Obama said in conclusion, \"And to take responsibility for it.\"\u00a0 The former VP also announced Wednesday he had beefed up his Pennsylvania operation with four new senior staffers, including two with experience in the western portion of the state, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Larry Hailsham Jr., Western political coordinator for Senator Bob Casey's 2018 Senate run, will serve as Biden's political director in the state.\u00a0 He most recently worked as a government affairs manager for the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce. Amy Dorra, who was Rep. Conor Lamb's political director as he flipped the state's 18th District and then its 17th District after the state's congressional map was redrawn, was named Biden's deputy coordinated political director in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Michael Feldman, who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign in Pennsylvania, will helm Biden's communications operation in the state. He most recently was the deputy communications director for Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group with a prime goal of protecting the Affordable Care Act. Nandi O'Connor, who worked as the digital director of the new anti-Trump coalition Organizing Together 2020 PA and as the Pennsylvania content producer for the Political Action Committee Priorities USA, will serve as Biden's coordinated digital director in the state. The announcement came two weeks after Biden's campaign announced the hiring of Brendan McPhillips as state director and Sincer\u00e9 Harris as senior advisor in the state.\u00a0 LIFE AFTER 2020 TOM STEYER Former presidential candidate Tom Steyer is holding his fourth fundraising event for the Biden campaign today and has already raised more than $12 million for the presumptive Democratic nominee. As a co-chair of the Climate Engagement Advisory Council for the Biden campaign, Steyer has been holding virtual events and reaching out to different communities around environmental justice so they can hear about Biden's priorities.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says\u00a0Steyer, who campaigned on the promise of making climate change his main focus if elected, also challenged the former VP on the debate stage in November to say that tackling environmental issues would be the number one priority for a Biden administration. Now, Steyer says Biden's climate plan, which was released last week and calls for $2 trillion in spending over four years, reflects a \"very progressive and thoughtful and people driven approach.\" Steyer said the plan combines job security with environmental and racial justice, creating a suite of issues that represent Biden's number one priority. Steyer also predicted turnout in the November presidential election will be \"by far the biggest in American history\" and urged young voters to make a statement. CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES TEXAS SCHOOLS CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of Americans in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0In Texas, the Houston Independent School District (HISD), the largest in the state, plans to start the fall semester virtually on September 8. The district plans to phase in in-person schooling after six weeks, though that goal may change. Parents can also disregard in-person start dates and keep their children home all semester or all year. One student group worried about school safety wants to weigh in. The Houston Independent School District Student Congress (HISD StuCo), a 70-member group of students from across the district, believes HISD ought to make the entire fall semester virtual and concentrate on building out a substantial online education experience for students.\u00a0 \"We took kids out of school in March when in Houston there were 30 cases. But now we're thinking about taking kids back to school in October when who knows how many cases there could be. So, what changed between now and then? And why is it safe now to send kids back to school and it wasn't safe before,\" StuCo speaker Jennifer Hadad wonders.\u00a0 Hamad, a rising senior at Houston Heights High School,\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0that the group wants to empower students to \"become change-makers within their district.\" They've created a survey for HISD teachers, parents, and students to share their thoughts on reopening. It discovered that most respondents want fall classes to remain virtual until it's safe to return, a moment they mark with the introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were asked if they prefer school remain virtual until there is a vaccine, and 74% said they agreed, while 18% disagreed. The majority felt a hybrid model combining in-person and virtual schooling would be no safer than a full time in-person semester \u2014 58.6% agreed while 25.7% \"strongly disagreed\" or \"disagreed.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER ELECTION RESULTS President Trump has declined to say whether he would accept the results of the election in November. Constitutional scholars and election experts contend that a president cannot dismiss the results of the election and hold on to power,\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns\u00a0reports.\u00a0 \"It is not up to President Trump, and the country does not have to satisfy him that he has lost,\" says Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University and a CBS News legal analyst. \"The Secret Service on Inauguration Day is under the direction of the new president. Upon the oath of office taken by his successor, President Trump becomes a guest in the White House. If he remains, he becomes an unwelcome guest.\u00a0 If he refuses to leave, he becomes an arrested guest.\"\u00a0 However, Turley says, the president (and any presidential campaign) can challenge the result in a given state, though there are rigid time constraints. Requests for recounts are permitted in 43 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of those states require the margin between candidates to be below a certain threshold. There is some concern among election experts about the impact of the president's rhetoric. Given the political divide on mail-in voting and Mr. Trump's previous comments, he could try to disparage absentee ballots if they don't match up with the results of the in-person votes. Mr. Trump has already raised questions about the legitimacy of the results in such a scenario, complaining the process will be rigged \u2013 though there is little evidence of fraud. \"The worst case scenario is that there is confusion or it is disputed on January 6 as to what the outcome is,\" says says Edward Foley, a constitutional law professor at The Ohio State University.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0adds that\u00a0a group of 30 grassroots and advocacy organizations have joined a group called Protect the Results to mobilize people if President Trump refuses to accept the election results. The organization is a joint project of liberal organizations Stand Up America and Indivisible. The groups who joined on Thursday \u2013 including many progressive groups \u2013 will be launching digital ads to encourage people to join the network. The announcement comes after President Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday, he would \"have to see,\" when asked if he would accept the election results. \"I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no, and I didn't last time either,\" Mr. Trump said. JOBS Traditional unemployment claims rose last week for the first time in nearly four months, a sign that the jobs recovery may be stalling as the coronavirus pandemic continues, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. About 1.4 million workers filed traditional jobless claims for the week ending July 18, the first time that metric has increased since late March, the Labor Department reported on Thursday. Another 975,000 people filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits, a program to help self-employed and gig workers. This was the 17th straight week that total jobless claims topped two million. For the week ending July 4, nearly 32 million people were claiming unemployment benefits, which is about a fifth of the American workforce. At the end of the month, the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government is set to expire. Lawmakers are meeting this week to negotiate a plan that may extend benefits, but could adjust how much money people receive each week. STATE-BY-STATE NEW MEXICO President Trump's deployment of federal agents to Albuquerque Wednesday caused a backlash from Democrats across New Mexico, as the state's Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham \u2013 a potential contender to be Joe Biden's running mate \u2013\u00a0warned against\u00a0a potential \"exercise meant only to escalate tension in New Mexico communities.\"\u00a0 Democrats fear a reprisal of the clashes that took place between protesters and federal agents in Portland and accuse the president of \"trying to win political points,\" though the Trump administration insisted the move was focused on curbing violent crime in Albuquerque.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports Republicans in New Mexico hailed the move, echoing the \"law and order\" ads that have blanketed New Mexico airwaves from the president's campaign. \"President Trump continues to provide police officers the support they need to keep New Mexicans safe. President Trump prioritizes safety, Joe Biden caves to lawlessness,\" Trump Victory spokesperson Andres Malave declared Thursday in an email. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE RATINGS House race ratings are continuing to shift in the favor of Democrats, the latest coming from\u00a0Sabato's Crystal Ball\u00a0at the University of Virginia. With the exception of Democrat Ron Kind's race in Wisconsin's 3rd District, seven House seats moved towards Democrats. Iowa's open seat in the 2nd District and Democrat incumbent Xochitl Torres Small's race in New Mexico's 2nd District changed from \"Toss-Up\" to \"Leans Democratic.\" In Texas, Republican Chip Roy's race against Democrat Wendy Davis shifted from \"Leans Republican\" to \"Toss-up.\"\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that Davis' campaign released an internal poll showing her tied with Roy and Biden leading Trump by 3 points in this district just north of San Antonio.\u00a0 ILLINOIS A day after saying President Trump \"wants to instigate a race war\" by sending federal troops to Portland, Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush introduced legislation on Thursday to issue licensing standards for police. His POLICE Act (Providing Officer Licensing to Increase Confidence for Everyone) would require officers to pass federally mandated policing standards and be licensed to serve their communities. The standards would be reviewable every 5 years, and have each state establish their own licensing and education programs for officers.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Rush claimed Trump has been stoking racial flames in order to win re-election. \"He wants to have Black folks fighting White folks. So he can rise up and say, 'I'm the real Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan and I'm the President. Re-elect me. That's what he's trying to do,\" he said on\u00a0Sirius XM.\u00a0He also objects to troops being sent into Chicago: \"Anytime you send a group of armed bandits...no name, no insignias...and you just snatch up innocent people and you take them off to some unknown place... you're terrorizing communities.\" Also in Illinois, Mike Madigan, the State's House Speaker and chair of the state's Democratic Party, has recently been under federal investigation for his\u00a0ties to a ComEd bribery scheme. Illinois Congressman Rodney Davis, a vulnerable incumbent Republican, has tried to\u00a0tie Madigan and the state Democratic party\u00a0to his Democrat opponent, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan. On Thursday,\u00a0Navarro\u00a0says Davis called for Madigan's immediate resignation, saying, \"Madigan has been at the center of many scandals, some involving corruption, for years. It's far past time that he step aside so we can begin to restore our state's tarnished reputation.\" \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The number of Americans who filed initial jobless claims last week shattered previous records after businesses nationwide closed their doors or reduced services because of the coronavirus pandemic. The\u00a0Labor Department\u00a0reported Thursday morning that 3,283,000 Americans filed initial unemployment insurance claims for the week ending March 21, nearly five times as many claims as the previous record of 695,000 during October 1982.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0notes the highest number of weekly claims during the Great Recession was 665,000 claims in March 2009.\u00a0 \"This isn't something we have experience with, this kind of suddenness,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. She noted, however, that the massive spike in claims was \"not unexpected\" and expects high numbers of initial jobless claims over the next few weeks before it tapers off. \"It could be that over 10 million people could lose their jobs by June, so these claims are going to be coming in steady,\" Gould said.\u00a0 Despite the unemployment numbers, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day up 1,351 points, or 6.4%. The S&P 500 finished Thursday up more than 17% since the close on Monday. In a press release, the Labor Department said data from states indicates that the service industries have been greatly impacted, especially accommodation and food service industries. Other industries cited for the spike in claims were the healthcare and social assistance, entertainment, transportation and manufacturing industries. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the jobless claims are \"not relevant\" right now because of the stimulus package that the Senate passed late Wednesday night. It provides direct payments to some Americans, provides funding for businesses to keep workers on payroll, and increases unemployment aid and expands who can apply for it. Gould is hopeful that legislation will provide relief for workers and believes it could lessen the effects coronavirus is having on the economy. But she disputed Mnuchin's claim, saying the jobless numbers are \"definitely relevant\" because the stimulus package hasn't been signed into law yet, and people don't have the extra money in their pockets that it will provide. \"They need that money to be able to pay their bills,\" Gould said.\u00a0 Before Thursday's numbers were released, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NBC News that the U.S. \"may well be in a recession,\" but said there is \"nothing fundamentally wrong with our economy.\" He expects economic activity to pick back up once the virus is under control, possibly in the second half of the year. \"The virus is going to dictate the timetable here,\" Powell said. \"The first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control, and then resume economic activity.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP The Trump Campaign headquarter offices in Northern Virginia will remain closed until April 24, reports\u00a0CBS News White House producer Fin Gomez. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has issued a statewide restriction due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a senior source tells CBS that campaign lawyers had advised it would be a misdemeanor to fail to comply.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0says the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee announced earlier in March that they are turning to digital and virtual events out of an abundance of caution. CONVENTION(AL) WISDOM TEXAS The Texas Democratic Party says it will be holding its state convention online as a result of concern about coronavirus,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster reports. The move came after Bexar County, home to San Antonio, where the convention was supposed to be held, approved an emergency public health declaration that banned events with more than 50 people through the time the convention was scheduled in early June.\u00a0 \"Make no mistake, there will be a Texas Democratic Convention, and the Party's business will be done,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. \"As the largest state convention in the country, the Texas Democratic Party knows that we have an obligation to Texas Democrats everywhere to make this convention open to everyone. We view this as an opportunity to do something groundbreaking: by moving into a digital forum, we will make it easier for individuals across Texas to participate by removing barriers associated with travel costs, missed work, or physical ability.\" Texas Democrats say they will announce more details about how the event is structured in the coming weeks. LIFE AFTER 2020 AMY KLOBUCHAR Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar along with Senator Ron Wyden touted $400 million in election funding as a \"first step\" after the Senate approved a massive $2 trillion relief bill late Wednesday night. The designated funding, contained in the stimulus package, would go through the Election Assistance Commission. States that apply would get at least $3 million and disbursements would be issued within 30 days. \"The whole idea is to get the money out immediately so states can use it to start or expand on, for the most part, their absentee and early balloting methods,\" Klobuchar said in a call with reporters Thursday. \u00a0\u00a0 Klobuchar and Wyden have introduced a bill that would enable states to expand vote-by-mail, allow more time for in-person early voting and assist with costs, like hiring and training new poll workers. Klobuchar told\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0she believes the measure will be revisited when the Senate reconvenes next month.\u00a0 \"We have a little more time right now. We have the fact that these last few (coronavirus) bills were just emergency reactions for understandable reasons,\" Klobuchar said. \"Now that these are done, of course, there is more work ahead and Senator Schumer has already said this is one of his top priorities.\" Wyden said he also believes the legislation will gain momentum as more primaries are postponed. \"This is now a major public safety issue,\" Wyden warned. \"We're looking at the possibility, if there is a worst-case scenario, of a very stark choice that people will have to either vote by mail or will not be able to vote at all.\" Separately, Klobuchar announced on Twitter late this afternoon that her husband, John, who has COVID-19 is out of the hospital.\u00a0 \"He took a good turn, was just released & is now recovering at home! Thanks to those who cared for him & for all front line health care workers,\" Klobuchar\u00a0tweeted. \u00a0ELIZABETH WARREN Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who focused on the effects of coronavirus at the end of her presidential campaign, today released an outline for the U.S. to drastically increase the number of coronavirus tests available in the U.S. The plan cites a bill introduced by Tammy Baldwin, co-sponsored by Warren, that would force President Donald Trump to significantly utilize the Defense Production Act, increasing funding for medical supplies and N95 masks.\u00a0 It also calls for Congress to develop a fund to pay to issue grants to test manufacturers. She also says the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps should be provided funds to pay temporary workers to administer tests. Warren also wants the demographic information of those tested to be provided to HHS to ensure tests are fairly distributed.\u00a0 As a presidential candidate,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says Warren had focused on the effects of the spread of coronavirus early on. In late January, she released a plan for preventing and containing infectious diseases. Over the subsequent weeks, the senator released and updated a $750 billion package that included a $400 billion stimulus to handle the effects of the virus. As Warren's campaign lost steam, her ability to deal with a challenge like that posed by coronavirus became a final pitch to voters. \"This crisis is a reminder that this primary isn't a game. We are picking a president \u2014 and we need someone whose core values can be trusted, who has a plan for how to govern, and who can actually get it done,\" Warren said in Houston the weekend before Super Tuesday and before she left the race. \"I will be that president.\" AD WARS ON THE ATTACK The Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA Action is expanding an ad buy after the Trump campaign threatened action against stations airing its ad in battleground states. The ad called \"Exponential Threat\" uses Donald Trump's own words earlier this year about the coronavirus to slam his response to the deadly COVID-19 outbreak.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says it started airing on Tuesday in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin as part of Priorities USA's $6 million TV and digital investment in battleground states highlighting the president's response to the pandemic.\u00a0 On Thursday, the group announced it would spend another $600,000 to air the ad in Arizona as well. The move comes after the Trump campaign on Wednesday sent cease-and-desist letters to TV stations airing the ad, claiming the ad contains \"false assertions\" and demanding the stations stop airing it or face legal action. But according to Priorities USA, the ad continues to air in the four battleground states. \"The fact that Trump is going to such great lengths to keep the American people from hearing his own words adds to the urgency of communicating them far and wide,\" said Priorities USA chairman Guy Cecil in a statement. ACTS OF KINDNESS NO PLACE LIKE HOME For weeks, colleges across the country have been migrating to online classes for the duration of the semester to prevent students from meeting in-person, to stem the spread of the coronavirus. When Benedict College in South Carolina decided it would close, there were still hundreds of cash-strapped students on campus wondering how to get home to their families. That is, until Benedict president Roslyn Artis and her team helped more than 100 domestic and international students go home,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. Deveall McClendon, a student at Benedict College, told\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0he wouldn't have been able to make it home without assistance from the school. McClendon, a senior sports management student at Benedict, said he was happy that the college went \"above and beyond\" to meet the needs of students. \"I'm just still happy that I was able to get around to be with my family.\" An online survey of more than 500 community college and university students conducted by the non-profit organization\u00a0Rise, showed that 21% of students reported they hadn't experienced significant changes as result of the coronavirus aside from the transition to online learning. However, 75% of students said they're experiencing higher levels of anxiety, depression or stress and 20% lack access to a mobile device or Wi-Fi. \"A lot of people relied on the computers in the library and like equipment at school that they needed to use because they didn't have it themselves [because] they couldn't afford it,\" said University of South Carolina junior Jalen Hodges. \"I can't really use a lot of the software, equipment, studio, and stuff like that\u2026just doing online, like video calls and stuff isn't enough.\" The lasting impacts of how the coronavirus outbreak will impact college-level students remains to be seen but for the time being, Benedict College sophomore Jayla Berry is just happy that her university was able to help her get home to Michigan. \"I will personally be forever grateful for what they gave to me and when I get back to school I'm going to find whoever paid for my flight,\" Berry told CBS News. \"I [am] going to give them a nice gesture like a thank you card\u2026because they really didn't have to do that.\"",

This week on FACE THE NATION, new coronavirus cases decline in the U. S. but the death toll rises. Congress and the White House failed to strike a deal and the President decides to go it alone. MAN #1: The President of the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: At his golf club in New Jersey, President Trump attempted on Saturday to bypass Congress and claimed authority to extend temporary economic relief, including jobless benefits to help families weather the pandemic. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've had it and we're going to save American jobs to provide relief to the American workers. MARGARET BRENNAN: But those executive actions left more questions than answers with the legality and cost of his plans unclear, even the President acknowledged he could be challenged in court. PAULA REID: This is expected to be tied up in the courts. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we get sued, it's somebody that doesn't want people to get money. Okay? And that's not going to be a very popular thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: All of that comes after Congress and the White House failed to agree on the latest COVID emergency aid package. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I've told them to come back when you-- when you are ready to give us a higher number. MARGARET BRENNAN: To top it all off, the intelligence community issued a stark warning that foreign powers are interfering in the presidential race and picking favorites. Our guests this week, in his first interview since recovering from the coronavirus, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. As the virus moves across the country, we'll hear from Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas where cases are rising. And Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, who's had success containing it. Former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb weighs in on reopening schools and keeping children safe. And Chicago Fed president Charles Evans says trouble is brewing if Congress doesn't find a way to provide more financial lifelines to Americans. Plus, Joe Biden spins his way closer to selecting a running mate. MAN #2 (Fox News): Mister Vice President, have you picked a running mate yet? JOE BIDEN (Fox News): Yeah, I have. MAN #2 (Fox News): You have? Who is it? MAN #3 (Fox News): Who is it? JOE BIDEN (Fox News): You. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our latest Battleground Tracker on how his pick will impact voters in two swing states. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We're in the middle of the recession and on the doorstep of an election and millions of out of work Americans have just had their unemployment benefits slashed. Congress and the White House have the power to provide the needed help, but this morning the country's top leaders are nowhere closer to a deal on the next coronavirus aid package. Nationwide the number of infections is decreasing but so is testing. For the first time since early March, the number of people tested for the virus declined and as cases dropped in some areas they increase in others. Our coverage begins with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): Eviction day near Houston for Lisa Pridea (ph) and her daughter, Ayanni (ph). LISA PRIDEA: This is beyond Ayanni and I know. This isn't about us anymore. This-- this has surpassed us. MARK STRASSMANN: An eviction crisis looms, COVID'S next catastrophic ripple. Over the next few months, as many as forty million renters could be forced to move. The jobless have lost a lifeline. No more extra six hundred dollars a week from Washington. ZACH NEUMANN (Senior Fellow, COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project): They lose their jobs and they're not able to work. Their ability to pay their bills goes away pretty quick. MARK STRASSMANN: New COVID cases keep rising quickly in eleven states, major cities from Portland to Kansas City to Boston, all face new warnings from the White House. COVID America can feel balkanized. New York City has checkpoints at major bridges and tunnels. Visitors from thirty-four states either quarantine for two weeks or face fines up to ten thousand dollars. BILL DE BLASIO (Mayor of New York City): It also will spread the word to all New Yorkers and all visitors that this is really, really serious. MARK STRASSMANN: In COVID-hot Florida, this gym owner was arrested for the third time. He refuses to make customers working out wear masks. Chicago is enforcing a mask mandate, up to twenty-five-hundred-dollar fines for businesses that ignore it. J. B. PRITZKER: This is a make-or-break moment for the state of Illinois. MARK STRASSMANN: Health experts agree, more testing and faster results would help. But nationally testing dropped by roughly a half million in the last week. One big reason, the backlog in testing labs. And common sense is always the wildcard. This is Sturgis, South Dakota, a bike jamboree for up to a quarter million people. More Harleys than masks at one of the biggest public gatherings since America's contagion began. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: After a week when seven thousand Americans died from COVID, some good news--the CDC now predicts that deaths from the virus will actually decrease over the next four weeks. But for that to happen, we're all going to have to fight off another epidemic: COVID fatigue. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. Thank you. We go now to the White House and President Trump's National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. This is his first interview since recovering from coronavirus. Good morning to you, Ambassador. We have just hit five million cases in this country. You were lucky one. You recovered. How are you feeling? And do you have aftereffects? ROBERT O'BRIEN (National Security Adviser/@robertcobrien): Well, it's always great to be back on your show, Margaret, but it's especially good to be back now. And, look, I've recovered fully and I'm very, very grateful. I was blessed and had a light case. I want to thank the White House medical team and Doctor Sean Conley for-- for their great care while I suffered through this-- this virus. And-- and I also want to thank my colleagues from the-- the President, the vice president, everyone down who was so supportive of me personally. And I hope that anyone else who is suffering from coronavirus, who is away from work, who is quarantined, has the same level of support from their colleagues at their office as I did for mine. So-- well, you know, it's a-- it's great to be back. And-- and-- and I've been very blessed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ROBERT O'BRIEN: But-- but this is a tough thing. It's a-- it's a-- it's a nasty virus and it's done great damage to our country. And my-- my heart goes out to the folks who didn't make it. I was-- I was fortunate. But there are a lot of people who didn't make it and there are a lot of people who are suffering greatly as a result of this virus. And-- and having been through this, my-- my heart really goes out to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, not all Americans receive the kind of elite care that you were able to. You know, unless you work in Major League Baseball or at the White House, you don't have access to regular asymptomatic testing. That's just not where we are as a country. How long before the average American can get that? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, we're working on testing and I think what-- what's happened with tests in America is really a miracle. I mean we haven't-- there's-- there's no country in the world that comes close to what America is doing on testing. But we're working on getting more testing out there. And our great American companies are coming up with faster tests, more mobile tests. And we need to get testing out there. But it's not just testing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We were supposed to be at five million tests a day at this point, we're not nearly that. In fact, we're now at five million infections as a country. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, we-- we've had a lot of infections as a country. And, again, this is something we need to keep in mind. I mean this came out of China and we've been fighting it ever since. The whole world's been fighting it. And there-- there have been hundreds of thousands or maybe over a million people worldwide who have been killed as a result of this virus. And we've got to remember where it came from. But we're going to fight like heck. We're working hard on vaccines. We're working hard on testing machines that are portable and fast, so the people around the country can be tested quickly. We're working on therapeutics. I mean, I'm so impressed with our scientists and our doctors and our first responders and the folks who are-- who are attacking this disease and-- and God bless them all. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know now that Congress and the White House were unable to come to this agreement on more funding for things, including a boost to testing. We also, because there's no agreement, don't have that boost to election security funding that Democrats were asking for. Ambassador, this country has never voted in a pandemic. Don't you need a boost to election security for states across this country? Don't you need more money before November? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, we're-- we're working on that with Congress. And what's really a shame and you had a piece in your-- in your lead up to-- to my conversation with you about the eviction that was taking place. I mean we have people that are going to be facing eviction and the President took executive action because Congress wouldn't-- wouldn't come forward to help people who are being evicted. So the President took executive action-- MARGARET BRENNAN: On election security that that was not actually included in these executive actions. Are you saying you do expect a bill to pass before November? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, I-- I hope so. And I want to make it clear there's been no administration that's done more for election security than this administration. Now, remember, the things that happened in 2016 and prior to that were under prior administrations. We've been putting hundreds of millions of dollars into election security at the NSC. We've been running a policy coordination process for months and months and months on election security. We're working with DHS; we're working with secretaries of state across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ROBERT O'BRIEN: There's-- there's no higher concern that we have than maintaining the-- the free and fair elections that are the cornerstone of our democracy. And, look, we know that there are people overseas, the Chinese, the Iranians, the Russians, others who would like to interfere with our democracy. And we're going to-- we're going to fight against that. And we're going to take every step necessary to harden our election infrastructure, harden our cyber infrastructure and-- and protect our elections a hundred percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that, specifically, because the intelligence community issued this very sharp warning on Friday detailing efforts to interfere. Looking at the statement from July 24th, though, the language there says adversaries are trying to access candidates' private communications and election infrastructure. And that's at both the state and the federal networks. That sounds an awful lot like what Russia did back in 2016, but now it's happening on your watch. So what are you doing to stop it? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well-- well, what we're doing is we've got our cyber teams in place. DHS is working very hard to track down those malign actors, but-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it Russia again? ROBERT O'BRIEN: --again, it's not just Russia. Well, look, we know it's China. We know it's Russia. We know it's Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tampering with election infrastructure? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, absolutely, trying to access secretary of state websites and that sort of thing and-- and collect data on-- on Americans and-- and engage in influence operations, whether it's on Tik Tok or Twitter or in other spaces. So, no, it's-- it's a real concern. And-- but it's- it's not just Russia, Margaret. It's-- the Chinese don't want the President re-elected. He's been tougher on China than any president in history. And-- and we're standing up for the first time to the Chinese Communist Party and protecting Americans, protecting our IP, protecting our economy, protecting our-- our vaccine data. And so there are a lot of people around the world that aren't happy with-- with America because they don't share our values. And-- and that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. And we're going to take every action necessary to-- to keep folks out, whether it's China or Russia or Iran-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --or Cuba or Venezuela or others. MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to clarify something here, because in the statement that we saw Friday, the counterintelligence chief released the statement saying China prefers President Trump to lose, but it, specifically, referred to public statements, policy disagreements. Are you here today saying that China is tampering with the U.S. election infrastructure? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, well they-- they'd like the-- the President to lose. And-- and China, like Russia, like Iran, have-- have engaged in cyberattacks and phishing and that sort of thing with-- with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites and that sort of thing. We're-- we're aware of it and we're-- we're taking steps to counter it. Whether it's China or Russia or Iran, we're not going to put up with it. And there will be severe consequences with any country that attempts to interfere with our free and fair elections, whether-- whether their-- their leaders prefer-- prefer Joe Biden or prefer Donald Trump, it doesn't matter. We're Americans. We don't-- we're not going to foreign countries deciding who our next President is going to be. That's outrageous. MARGARET BRENNAN: This statement Friday, specifically, when it came to Russia, detailed an active campaign to denigrate Joe Biden. That was the language used, denigrate former Vice President Biden. And it, specifically, also mentioned Kremlin-linked actors seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television. When President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin July 23rd, did he tell them to knock this off? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, the-- the President has told the Russians, and we've told the Russians, our counterparts, many, many times not to get involved in our election. That it's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But did President Trump tell that to President Putin? ROBERT O'BRIEN: --a red line. You know, what-- what I don't get involved in, you know, unlike perhaps some of my predecessors or others who leaked documents, I don't-- I don't get into the-- the conversations that the President has with foreign heads of state, whether it's Russia or France or the U.K. for that matter. Those are private conversations. But I can tell you, we've made it very clear to the Russians, very clear. No-- no administration has been tougher on the Russians. We've sanctioned hundreds of Russian entities. We've sanctioned the troll farms. We've sanctioned Rosneft-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're doing it again is what you're saying. So the message clearly wasn't received. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well look-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Did President Trump say to Vladimir Putin knock it off this time? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Margaret, there's almost nothing we can sanction left of the Russians. We-- we put so many sanctions on the Russians that, by the way, that the prior administration didn't do. We've sanctioned the heck out of the Russians, individuals, companies, the government, whether it's related to Nord-- Nord Stream or Rosneft. We've-- we've kicked, you know, out literally scores of-- of Russian spies. We've closed down all their consulates on the West Coast. We've closed down diplomatic facilities. There's not a lot left we can do with the Russians. But nevertheless, we continue to message the Russians. And President Trump continues to message-- message the Russians: don't get involved in our elections. And by the way, that message is to the Chinese and that message-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --is to Tehran as well. Don't do it because there will be severe consequences. And we've shown that. Keep in mind, all of these sanctions, all of this toughness on Russia happened under President Trump, not under prior presidents, not under Obama-Biden administration. It happened under the Trump administration. No one's been-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the intelligence community is saying that the interference is also happening on President Trump's watch, which is why I'm specifically asking you, you know, what are you doing to stop it? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, look, we've made it-- we've made it very clear to our adversaries, whether it's China or Russia or Iran, stay out of our election. And we're taking steps across the board to harden our election infrastructure. We're pumping money into the states. DHS has a massive program running. In my shop at the NSC, under President Trump's direction, we've got a massive program running-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --to keep our elections free and fair. And look, I don't-- I don't want foreign governments to support Joe Biden to influence our elections. I don't want foreign governments to support President Trump to influence our elections. Amer-- the American people should decide our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. O'BRIEN: That's-- that's clear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador O'Brien, thank you. I'm glad that you're back and that you are feeling well. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Great to be with you. Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in a moment with Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We now go to Kansas City, Missouri, one of ten areas in the U.S. that the White House coronavirus task force is concerned about. Mayor Quinton Lucas is in Kansas City. Good morning to you. QUINTON LUCAS (Mayor of Kansas City/@QuintonLucasKC): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand Doctor Deborah Birx spoke to you on Monday and said Kansas City is a potential hotspot for rising infections, really looking at young people twenty to twenty-nine as rising in the infection rate. What is fueling the spread? QUINTON LUCAS: Well, we're seeing a lot of activity that has been against public health advice, not just people who have congregated in bars and restaurants, but also informal spread, as we've called it, in Kansas City, house parties of up to hundreds of people, a lot of backyard parties and a lot of folks in families and other informal settings that aren't following social distancing rules, aren't wearing masks. And that has helped fuel the spread both here and in the states around us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, I know the White House has recommended that you bring things like capacity in bars down to twenty-five percent from where you already have it. Why haven't you done that? QUINTON LUCAS: Well, we're at fifty percent in our restaurants and we have limited bars. One of the reasons that we have not limited it entirely, yet, is because we don't just want people going back out into the streets to celebrate. And this is really kind of our summertime challenge that we have folks that are congregating in large groups already, in some ways informal spread presenting greater threats, because none of these places are following rules. All of them have a large amount of spread. But we are evaluating limiting both restaurants and bar capacity to avoid some of the spikes you saw in places like Houston and Phoenix and in the state of Florida. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you may be doing this even though there may be an economic hit that comes with it? QUINTON LUCAS: Well, we absolutely are. I mean one of the challenges that a lot of Midwestern and Southwestern cities are having is that we are surrounded by states that don't have things like mask orders, that don't have some of the same social distancing and restaurant rules we have. So every rule that we impose, we're surrounded in the state of Missouri and Kansas by a number of jurisdictions that lack it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. QUINTON LUCAS: So we would like consistency largely from the White House to help make it clearer what we need to do to stop the spread here in the central United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House is saying wear a mask. The White House is also saying, as we said there, bring those capacities down. On the letter you sent, I want to ask you about, to the President this week, you were one of a number of mayors who asked, specifically, for more funding. Two hundred and fifty billion dollars to be given to cities of all sizes. This was not in the executive orders that the President signed. And we know deals in Congress appear to be on hold. So how is your city going to get the money it needs? And-- and at what cost do these cuts come? QUINTON LUCAS: Well, right now we're just not getting it. So you're seeing a lot of deficit spending from cities. Mine has already put out millions of dollars in COVID-19 response. And the impact is actually going to be to American workers. Those who work for state, local, county governments are going to deal with the brunt of it. We're talking about furloughs. There have been layoffs in a number of American cities-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to have to lay off? MAYOR LUCAS: --and we continue to have increased-- I-- I believe we will. And lots of other cities have, and this is hitting lots of employees, so this isn't just theoretical for us and these are issues that are significant and in the now. And so we're looking for a deal. When you talk about things like real unemployment benefit extensions, that's something that lots of Kansas Citians are dealing with. So we feel like we are trying to answer a crisis moment where in some situations we haven't seen that response from Washington that is sorely needed here in the Midwest. MARGARET BRENNAN: So your city has delayed the start of the school year until after Labor Day from what I understand. And you cited more funding being needed for schools. It doesn't sound like there will necessarily be a deal to give you that money. So, what does this mean for your school children? Do you need to push back the school year even farther? QUINTON LUCAS: Well, when I was talking about White House direction before, that was a question I asked directly of Doctor Birx, of should we have in-person schooling or not? She deferred from answering that question. And so in many ways, our school districts are-- are trying to use the best advice possible. But you've seen lots go to a mixed virtual in-person learning environment. There are some that are going right back to in-person. And you've seen in other parts of the country some trouble and COVID outbreaks from that. But our advice is-- was to buy time to make sure we could have funding for things like PPE, masks, separation, social distancing, and to better understand what school reopening can mean from an epidemiological perspective. We are not there yet, so I think we all have some grave concerns about reopening, particularly at a time you're seeing spikes in this community. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what were you looking for, Doctor Birx, to tell you that she didn't? Like, literally give you a green light, it's safe-- QUINTON LUCAS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --or to give you a benchmark at which you could make a decision to open or close? QUINTON LUCAS: You know, I think a mix of both. First of all, benchmarks are always helpful. We had asked for additional information, some written documentary information that we could share with the public in places like Kansas City. We did not receive that, although I did appreciate the call. And then I do think that, frankly, every parent, every teacher, everyone in America is saying, is it safe? You know, I'm a lawyer by training. I talk to doctors and health care professionals here, but these are calls necessarily that sometimes mayors may not be equipped to make or some governors. So I do think that looking at the most medical evidence and information we have nationally to see what a direction broadly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. QUINTON LUCAS: --on schools is should be the guide for reopening schools, not just the different politics state to state and city to city, which is what we're seeing in my part of the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And very quickly, there's a fourteen-day backlog in testing in your city. How do you fix that? QUINTON LUCAS: Money. Money. We need more resources to get more testing, to get faster testing through. That's the biggest challenge and we're going to continue to see this spread unless we get more testing efficiently for people. So, I think money. A solution out of Washington is key for not just mine, but all American cities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Mayor, thank you for your time this morning. QUINTON LUCAS: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a look at new numbers from our CBS News Battleground Tracker. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning we have a new poll that looks at the presidential race in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Late on election night in 2016, it was these two states that put Donald Trump over the top and secured his victory over Hillary Clinton. But today, former Vice President Biden is up by six points in both states, according to our CBS Battleground Tracker. We asked CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto what is putting Biden in the lead there. ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, it's concern about the President's handling of COVID that is outweighing any edge he might have on handling the economy. We unpack that a little bit. There still seems to be some goodwill towards the President in his handling of the economy for voters looking back at how the economy was before the outbreak, specifically things like manufacturing jobs in these states. They say returning rather than leaving, that was a key campaign promise. But when you look at the way the President has such negative ratings on handling COVID, specifically, parents concerned that their kids are going back to school, that schools they don't want to reopen fully, they feel like the administration is pressuring for that, feeling like the administration is not doing enough to combat the virus and then that is more closely associated with vote than any views on the economy. You see, specifically, the feeling that Joe Biden would do a better job handling the outbreak and then the feeling that Joe Biden is more attuned to the needs and concerns of a lot of these voters. So Biden is swinging a lot of voters, independents who voted for Donald Trump the last time. And when you look at what's changed since 2016 which you mentioned, well, Donald Trump won these states based on a lot of voters who were looking for change. When they look back and now, they tell us, this is not necessarily what they expected. In fact, more say that things have gone worse than things have gone better and that's kind of your classic voting calculus at play right now. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And since we expect former Vice President Joe Biden to announce his running mate sometime this week, our Battleground Tracker also surveyed how important that decision is to voters. Many voters, thirty-eight percent in Pennsylvania and forty-four percent in Wisconsin said Biden's choice for vice president is important to them. It is even more so for those who say they are currently not voting for Biden but could consider him. For more analysis from Anthony Salvanto and further results, go to cbsnews.com/polls. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz, who takes a look at what it's like going back to school during a pandemic. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Schools are beginning to reopen around the country. And despite efforts to socially distance students, states returning to the classroom are already reporting coronavirus cases. CBS News' correspondent Adriana Diaz is in Chicago, where earlier this week that city's mayor said in-person learning is too risky for area public schools. (Begin VT) ADRIANA DIAZ (CBS News Correspondent/@adrianasdiaz): For schools reopening tomorrow, the routine morning drop-off will be masked by something new. WILLIAM SCHLEUSNER: You got to find the right one, to breathe right. ADRIANA DIAZ: Face coverings are required in Enterprise, Alabama. And they will be mandatory in September for New York City schools which just got state approval to split the school week between in-person and online classes. It's one of only two of the nation's ten largest school districts, offering some in-person instruction. All others are strictly online. Of the twenty-one school districts reopening Monday, eight will be in-person fulltime. Mostly in the South. The patchwork of plans nationwide is spurring debate and division. CROWD (in unison): We want school. ADRIANA DIAZ: Elkhart, Indiana, scrapped its virtual learning plan hours after parents protested. Chicago also reversed course, but with schools now starting online instead of a hybrid plan. Chicago mom Julia Deveski (ph) worries her six-year-old daughter Hazel (ph) will have too much screen time and too little socialization. JULIA DEVESKI: I know if she goes to virtual learning fulltime, it's going to be damaging for her forever. So I just don't want to do that and it's-- I mean it's sad. ADRIANA DIAZ: Nationwide, parents are somewhat split. In one poll, forty-four percent surveyed say it's safe to send children back to school. But fifty-six percent do not. The divide skews among teachers. A separate poll found that eighty-two percent are concerned about in-school instruction. Remember this photo of a crowded hallway and few masks at a Georgia high school? Well, that same school informed parents yesterday that six students and three staff members have tested positive. In Mississippi, more than a hundred students are under quarantine in one district. At another, a teacher and assistant football coach died last Thursday. Forty-two-year-old Nacoma James was self-quarantining when school started, but he had spent the summer training football players. (End VT) ADRIANA DIAZ: That Mississippi school is now contact-tracing to determine which students may have been exposed. Back here in Chicago there are concerns that remote learning will exacerbate inequalities. The city's announced plans to help bridge technology gaps and support parents who need childcare. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Adriana Diaz in Chicago. Thank you. We want to go now to Hartford, Connecticut, and Governor Ned Lamont. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT (D-Connecticut/@GovNedLamont): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You decided or you said back in June that you wanted schools to reopen for in-person learning. Doctor Fauci visited the state this week and said the state should reopen. I'm wondering what your plan is to keep schools open. How do you contain asymptomatic spread? And are you regularly testing teachers? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: So, first of all, we are one of the first states in the country to close down schools and we've been very cautious as we reopen the rest of our economy. And Doctor Fauci has been helpful. Scott Gottlieb, your next guest, very helpful. Kept a very low infection rate, about one percent, one of the lowest in the country over the last six, seven weeks now. So I think if Connecticut can't get reopened, I don't know who can around the country. And we're doing it led by public health, making sure everybody's wearing the masks; making sure that we have the Plexiglas where needed; cohorting, so the one fifth-grade class doesn't party with another fifth-grade class. And I think we're going to give our kids the best shot for in-classroom education. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about prioritizing testing? How do you stay open without regularly spot testing students and teachers? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, what testing does is tells you whether or not you are infected. As you pointed out in the previous shot, you know, many people are asymptomatic and contagious before they are tested. So, we have to watch out for that. We have a hundred and sixty testing centers. Any teacher that wants to go get a free test, recommending maybe some of them do that before the start of the school year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So it's not currently part of the plan, but you're saying the state has access to tests. I want to ask you, though, about what something your office pointed out to us, which is that a hundred and forty-three thousand kids just simply did not log on for remote learning back in the spring in March, April, and May. Do you know how much damage was done? And if you have to shut down and go remote again, how do you avoid these kids getting lost? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: I-- I think-- I do not want a lost year, and when everybody says, let's not go back to school until it's perfectly safe, until we have a vaccine, until a hundred percent of the people are vaccinated, I worry that could be a lost year of education. But, in the meantime, we do need a backup plan. So we've bought a hundred thousand Chromebooks. We're getting them installed in every kid's home that doesn't feel comfortable getting back to school. The teachers' homes, if they don't feel comfortable getting back, expanded Wi-Fi so those kids can-- can connect at least with their classmates over Zoom. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about those kids who just didn't log on at all in the spring? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: It's a tragedy. We made it available to everybody we could. But, again, it requires parental supervision, requires a-- a lot of effort to make sure everybody logs in. Right now we're going to have a telephone backup, better coordination, I think, with parents. But it by no means perfect. MARGARET BRENNAN: The President, as you know, announced these executive actions yesterday after Congress didn't come to an agreement. And his announcement calls for states to provide a hundred dollars a week for every unemployed person in their state. On top of what he says they are going to redirect from FEMA to make up for the expired federal boost. Does Connecticut have that funding to kick in? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Look, that would cost us about five hundred million dollars between now and the end of the year. I could take that money from testing. I don't think that's a great idea. I could take that money from, you know, mass disinfecting for our schools. I don't think that's a great idea. In fact, I think the President's plan is not a great idea. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, how long would it even take you to get that up and running? I mean what's going to happen to the unemployed people in your state who just saw six hundred dollars a week disappear? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, I mean, remember, we are continuing to provide them the state unemployment compensation-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR LAMONT: --which is four-- four hundred and fifty dollars, we're talking about the extra six hundred dollars that the federal government put on. It's sort of a bridge. They did that a few months ago until we got our economy going. MARGARET BRENNAN: But now it's a cliff. GOVERNOR LAMONT: Let's face it, our economy in Connecticut is going-- is going better than most other places. But there's still, you know, tens of thousands who can't get a job and many of them in bars and the such, there's no job available to them. So there has to be some sort of a cushion. MARGARET BRENNAN: You spoke to the President this week. Connecticut has been hit hard. I know of my own family members about power outages largely across the state due to this tropical storm. Has COVID slowed down the response to this storm? What is-- when-- when are the lights going back on? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: I'd say we were hit hard by this tropical storm and we lost almost half our power across the state, and then you realize that means water treatment centers and nursing homes and a whole variety of real emergencies that have to be put out. In the meantime, we're bringing in thousands of contractors from around the region and around the country. And you're right. In the middle of a COVID pandemic, hey, I got a quarantine on people from South Carolina, please come on up and fix our wires. But we're getting people tested and we're fixing the wires. Number one safety, we got to get electricity back on. MARGARET BRENNAN: So COVID has slowed down the response. And just to button up, I want to make sure I totally understood what you said there on unemployment. Is the bottom line for people in Connecticut that they just won't get any additional money on top of their regular state unemployment payment? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Yeah, Margaret, I wouldn't say COVID slowed down our response on the electric hit at all and in addition to what we're providing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just mentioned having to quarantine crews. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: No, we're not quarantining them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: They are essential workers, we're getting them back up on the poles as fast as we can, essential workers. What was your other question? MARGARET BRENNAN: I just was buttoning up what you said on unemployment. You said the president's plan is not a good one. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Oh, I-- yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you telling people that they just won't get any additional money on top of what's already being provided? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, they're surely going to get additional support from the state of Connecticut. I would like to see the federal government step up, extend the unemployment (INDISTINCT) up a little bit longer, let people get on their feet. What I'm doing here at the state level is in particular rent relief. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: I've got, you know, tens of thousands of people who fear eviction. We have an eviction moratorium. We put money in place to help them negotiate with their landlord-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: --so they can start, you know, paying down their overdue to the landlord. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Governor Lamont, good luck to you. Thank you for your time. We'll be right back with Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor. Scott Gottlieb. He joins us from Stamford, Connecticut, this morning. Good morning to you. I know you've been dealing-- SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: --with power outages in Connecticut as well. So I thank you for-- for coming on today. I want to ask you this overall number. It seems stunning. Five million coronavirus cases in the United States. Two and a half weeks ago, you predicted that by the end of the year we could be at three hundred thousand deaths. Is that still where you think we are headed? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we're definitely going to be somewhere between two hundred thousand and three hundred thousand, and whether we're closer to two hundred thousand or closer to three hundred thousand depends on what we do and how this evolves. We've now had two waves of this epidemic, the New York wave and now the wave through the Sun Belt, which is receding, although Texas is showing signs of an uptick at least in the last week and that needs to be followed closely. We're probably going to have another wave. And the concern now is that this has become so pervasive across the country that it could start to infect more rural communities that have largely been untouched to date and probably are a little bit more complacent because they have been untouched, but are still very vulnerable because the infection hasn't been there. And if-- if this does become more pervasive across the country and it's not just in the urban centers, but also in more rural parts of the country, that's going to be far more difficult to control if it's more widespread. And we're seeing indications of that right now, the way it's spreading in the Midwest and the west. MARGARET BRENNAN: When does someone who has COVID stop being a risk to others? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, the data shows ten days after the onset of symptoms, you're no longer shedding virus that can cause someone else to become infected. So you'll continue to shed virus for a persistent period of time. But when that virus has been cultured, it hasn't grown, which means it's dead virus. And so right now, the recommendation is that ten days after the onset of symptoms, if those symptoms have resolved, if you don't have severe illness, then you're no longer contagious. Previously, we were saying about two weeks, but the more recent data outlines about ten days. MARGARET BRENNAN: So we still have that question of, you know, what if you just don't know. And since forty percent of cases, according to the CDC, are asymptomatic, you don't really necessarily know who is carrying the virus. So you've talked about the need to increase testing and to improve it. Should there be a requirement that teachers get tested before they go into a classroom, that anyone going back to the office full time get a test? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, ideally, we would have that. If you look at what universities are doing right now that are reopening for on campus learning, they're implementing widespread testing. They're testing students two or three days a week. We don't have the resources. We don't have the capabilities right now in most districts to do that. And that really is the bottleneck. We need the-- we need to implement more low-cost tests, tests that could be done at the point of care or at the point of school or work. There's going to be a saliva test that's hopefully coming on the market, going to get an authorization from FDA in the next week, and that will provide more access to testing. But right now, we don't have the testing available to implement the kind of oversight that we'd like. It is the case that if you're asymptomatic, you're less likely to spread the virus. CDC models that people who are asymptomatic are about fifty percent less likely to spread the virus and you're probably most contagious right before you develop symptoms. And that's really what leads to the super spreading events. People don't know that they're sick, yet, because they haven't quite developed symptoms. They may be a day away from developing symptoms and they go into a confined space. And it leads to these situations where one case can lead to thirty cases. So after you've had symptoms for a number of days, your-- your infectivity, your ability to spread the virus probably declines. MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen-- when it comes to schools, we've seen these really troubling reports this week of a few children who have died after testing positive for COVID. You said time and again, children are not immune. It is just not clear what the impact of the virus is on them. What more do we know at this point? The President keeps saying they're immune and we know that's false, correct? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: We need to have a degree of humility. Children are not immune to this virus. We have seen bad outcomes. The CDC recently documented five hundred and seventy cases of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. There's more cases that are occurring. We've seen children die. There's eighty-six kids who've died from this and thousands that have been hospitalized. And so this is a risk in children. We haven't fully characterized that risk and we're learning new things about this virus all the time. There's been data in the last few weeks that shows that the virus is having impacts on the hearts of adult patients, causing inflammation and some long-term sequelae and cardiac symptoms in adults. Previously, we didn't really understand that or know that, and so we're learning a lot about this novel virus all the time. We need to have a degree of humility about the risks. We need to try to protect children. So if we do reopen schools and I believe we should, we need to do it with a sense of caution. This is complicated by the fact that there's been really a mixed experience when it comes to reopening the schools. We've seen some countries successfully do it. Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark have successfully reopened schools, albeit with a lot of measures to try to control the risk of outbreak. Sweden let their schools open-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --but on the other hand, Israel reopened schools and it led to outbreaks that then led to a resurgence nationally. And we've seen outbreaks in summer camps, the situation in Georgia and Missouri. We've seen large outbreaks among kids in summer camps. So we need to try to learn what went right, what went wrong as we step forward and try to reopen the schools this fall. MARGARET BRENNAN: This week the State Department warned that Russia is spreading disinformation about COVID, specifically, vaccines. How should we understand this in terms of how vulnerable our country is? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think our country is vulnerable to this pathogen because we have unique risks owing to our federal system, owing to our culture, and we also have some vaccine hesitancy. So it's going to be very important to imbue confidence in the vaccine when it eventually does come through the authorization or the approval process by FDA. So I think we're vulnerable to that kind of information. The other thing to think about here is that this has now posed an asymmetric risk for the United States. Other countries looking in now can conclude that a respiratory pathogen poses a greater danger to the United States and perhaps other nations that have been grappling with this more successfully. And so it was always thought that a rogue nation would never unleash a pathogen deliberately. And I'm not saying this was a deliberate pathogen-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: By all-- everything we know, it was naturally occurring, but it was always thought a nation would never deliberately unleash a pathogen that can blow back on them. That thinking might have to be adjusted now that this has posed such an asymmetric risk to the United States relative to other nations that some of which are our adversaries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Doctor Scott Gottlieb. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles Evans. Good morning to you. CHARLES EVANS (President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like talks have completely stalled on Capitol Hill. There is no emergency aid package on its way to the American people. What is the impact of this failure on the economy? CHARLES EVANS: Well, I think that's a very important and unfortunate development. I would say that fiscal policy has been unbelievably important in supporting the economy during the downturn that we've been experiencing. The economy closed down in March and April and fiscal policy swung into action very quickly with the CARES Act. And that's helped ensure that people could stay at home, be safe, pay their rent, increase food security, all kinds of things for vulnerable populations. And now that continues to be important because we've not got control over the virus spread. I think that public confidence is really important and another support package is really in-- incredibly important. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, you've said it's not the job of central bankers like yourself. It's up to fiscal policy, the lawmakers. So even with what the President has announced and the questions around the legality and practicality of it, does this basically mean we should just assume there are going to be significant cutbacks in the middle of a recession? And what does that mean for increases in job losses? CHARLES EVANS: You know, so if you look at the economic outlook, there are some negative scenarios and the ones that are, you know, most pessimistic involve not supporting state and local governments. I think you heard the Connecticut governor say that if he has to put twenty-five percent support against the President's executive order support for unemployment insurance, then that's going to cut back on other things. States have to balance their budgets. They are experiencing reduced tax revenues. And so there will be employment reductions. State and local governments account for about ten percent of employment in the United States. And so that's really another leg down, I think. Paycheck Protection has been very useful. Extending that to small businesses also would be very helpful. You know, in Chicago, we've had some panels. We've talked to people in neighborhoods, middle income, minority neighborhoods. And according to-- to-- to Stacie Young, the Preservation project, she's indicated that unemployment insurance has really helped low-income workers pay their rent. They've been able to-- in those neighborhoods, small businesses or landlords, and so that keeps the money in the neighborhoods and provides better food security. I think that Scott Gottlieb just mentioned, it also spills over to rural-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. CHARLES EVANS: --and exurb areas, too, because they're also hard hit. So it's, you know, widespread support could be very beneficial. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the official unemployment rate is at ten percent. What do you think the actual is and where do you think it's headed, given what you just laid out? CHARLES EVANS: Undoubtedly, you know, it is somewhat higher. It doesn't capture all the people who'd really like to work and somehow don't fill out the surveys right. I think there's a percentage point discrepancy. I think it also-- there's a huge amount of inequality it's-- it's experienced according to different racial groups. And so black unemployment is over fourteen percent. Hispanic unemployment is over twelve percent. White unemployment is nine percent. So that inequality gap has persisted. And I think that providing more support, the Fed has been providing accommodation. I think if we got the kind of support that we needed as quickly as possible, got control of the virus, perhaps all the people who were sent home to stay safe could be brought back by their-- by their previous employers. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. CHARLES EVANS: We are down 12.9 million jobs since February. If more-- most of those could go back, we could enjoy low unemployment like we experienced at the end of 2019. MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point, your colleague in Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, was on this program last week, and he called for a month or six-week shutdown to get the kind of contact tracing in place to do what the Northeast has been able to do. Do you agree that is what-- is what is needed? CHARLES EVANS: You know I think a very strong program like that would have the opportunity to get on top of the virus, but it would come at quite a lot of hardship for small businesses. It would require tremendous fiscal support. If the, you know, national U.S. government were willing to do that, I think we could knock down the virus spread, the way that Scott Gottlieb and others have said is so essential. What we need is public confidence so that people feel good about going back to work. They feel safe. They can go out to retail establishments and enjoy leisure and hospitality and activities, put more people back to work. So while that could work, I'm not optimistic that that would be actually adopted. So I think that resources for testing, tracing, isolating people, trying to get control of the virus so that we can get it down and then go back to enjoy the type of activities that in Germany they're experiencing and in Asia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Thank you very much, Mister Evans, for laying out for us what you're seeing out there. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we leave you today, we want to take a moment to remember the life of a trailblazer in journalism and a member of our FACE THE NATION family. Mary Hager, the mother of our executive producer of the same name, passed away on Tuesday. She was one of the first female reporters at the Palo Alto Times and later worked at Newsweek Magazine here in Washington, covering science, medicine, the environment and space. Her daughter, and our executive producer, says her mother was both the smartest and the kindest person she had ever known. And she will be dearly missed. That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "As the battle for the White House continues to heat up, President Trump and Michael Bloomberg escalated their\u00a0feud\u00a0on Thursday, taking to Twitter to trade insults, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0and\u00a0CBSNews.com writer Melissa Quinn. The latest battle between the two New Yorkers began Thursday morning when Mr. Trump fired off a pair of tweets mocking Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, for his height and equating him to Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor he went up against in the Republican presidential primary in 2016. \"Mini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but can't debate and has zero presence, you will see. He reminds me of a tiny version of Jeb 'Low Energy' Bush, but Jeb has more political skill and has treated the Black community much better than Mini!\" the president tweeted. \"Mini Mike is a 5'4\" mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians. No boxes please. He hates Crazy Bernie and will, with enough money, possibly stop him. Bernie's people will go nuts!\" Mr. Trump said in a second tweet, which included an altered photo of Bloomberg in an oversized suit and tie. The president's insults prompted a fiery response from Bloomberg's Twitter account suggesting New Yorkers make fun of the president behind closed doors and scoff at his claims of being a self-made man. \".@realDonaldTrump\u00a0- we know many of the same people in NY. Behind your back they laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown. They know you inherited a fortune & squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence. I have the record & the resources to defeat you. And I will,\" the tweet composed by campaign staff read. Bloomberg himself addressed the president's attacks during an event in Greensboro, North Carolina, during which he said Mr. Trump is \"afraid\" of him, as evidenced by his Twitter activity. \"The president attacked me again this morning on Twitter,\" he told supporters. \"Thank you very much Donald. He sees our polls and I think it's fair to say he's scared because he knows I have the record and the resources to defeat him.\" Bloomberg added, \"Donald, where I come from, we measure your height from your neck up.\" While the president frequently attacks his Democratic opponents \u2014 he calls Elizabeth Warren \"Pocahontas\" and Bernie Sanders \"crazy\" \u2014 he has\u00a0ramped up his tweets\u00a0maligning Bloomberg. The president claimed the former mayor is a \"terrible debater and speaker\" in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0last month and\u00a0called his advertising blitz\u00a0a \"vanity project for him to get into the game.\" Bloomberg\u00a0fired back, saying Trump is \"the expert on vanity projects.\" The two also shelled out millions on\u00a0dueling ads\u00a0during the Super Bowl. While Mr. Trump has Bloomberg beat on height \u2014 the president stands at 6 feet 2 inches compared to Bloomberg's 5 feet 7 inches \u2014 the former mayor is worth more. Forbes estimates Bloomberg\u00a0is worth\u00a0$61.8 billion as of Thursday, while the president's\u00a0net worth\u00a0is $3.1 billion. TOM STEYER As 2020 Democratic presidential candidates vie for the support of South Carolina voters ahead of the state's primary two weeks away, Greenwood County Councilwoman Edith Childs told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0she'll be supporting Tom Steyer because she trusts that he cares about the interests of her constituents and others.\u00a0 \"Tom has a feeling for people,\" said Childs. \"And when you have a feeling for people, you know that people are in distress and you want to do something to make a difference in their lives.\" Childs who is also known for her knowledge on environmental injustice in her community, told\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0that some residents in her district live close to what used to be a landfill and that of all the candidates, she feels Steyer is the best to take on this environmental challenge.\u00a0 Childs, who was an ardent supporter of President Barack Obama said she won't be supporting his former vice president, Joe Biden, in part because she felt he didn't defend Mr. Obama enough on past debate stages as it pertained to issues like healthcare. \"He should have been more behind some of the things that President Obama had already taken care of.\" NEVADA The Culinary Workers Union announced Thursday it does not plan to endorse a presidential candidate ahead of Nevada's caucuses on February 22, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0 \"We are not going to endorse a candidate, a political candidate,\" Culinary Union chief Geoconda Arguello Kline said at a news conference announcing the decision. \"We respect every political candidate right now.\" Arguello Kline did, however, single out one candidate for praise, former Vice President Joe Biden. \"We know Vice President Biden for many years,\" she said. \"We know he has been our friend.\" She repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether the union's member leadership had voted on whether to endorse a candidate. The decision not to endorse had been telegraphed for weeks by the union. It's nonetheless likely to come as a blow to Biden, whose campaign shares close ties with the union. The Culinary Union has often touted its endorsement in 2008 of Barack Obama, who actually fell short of scoring the\u00a0majority of votes in the state. In 2016, the labor group mostly sat out the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 \u00a0 NEW HAMPSHIRE The candidates have already moved on to the next states to vote in the Democratic presidential primary says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, but here are some\u00a0facts and figures\u00a0and takeaways about the voters and the candidates from both public data and the CBS News' Elections and Surveys unit: Secretary of State Bill Gardner has posted official\u00a0presidential primary returns here.\u00a0 Democrats flooded Tuesday night's Democratic primary, with over 298,000 votes counted as of Wednesday night. The number exceeds the 254,780 ballots cast in 2016 and the 288,672 ballots cast in 2008 \u2014 the previous Granite State record for Democrats.\u00a0 But a word of caution on characterizing turnout this year as \"record-breaking.\" In New Hampshire, undeclared (independent) voters may cast a ballot in either primary. Given the virtually uncontested Republican primary this year, a greater share of undeclared voters were free to weigh in on the Democratic side. According to CBS News exit polls, 43% of participants in this year's New Hampshire presidential primary were undeclared voters compared to 40% in 2016. New Hampshire's largest city \u2013 the urban ground zero of New Hampshire's opioid epidemic \u2013 voted for Bernie Sanders (30%), who was trailed by Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Amy Klobuchar (17%). Sanders had his strongest performance in Wards 4, 5 and 7, representing Manchester's more diverse, lower-income, inner-city neighborhoods. Manchester's more affluent, northern end backed Buttigieg and Klobuchar in larger numbers. Joe Biden's fourth place finish in Manchester (9.7%) while greater than his statewide vote share (8.4%) was a blow to his campaign.\u00a0 Sanders came out ahead in New Hampshire's capital, populated by establishment Democrats and never-Trumpers. The Vermont senator earned just under 27% of the vote, followed by Buttigieg and Klobuchar (tied at 22%). Klobuchar's second-place finish in Concord is a testament to the large number of state lawmaker endorsements she received in the run-up to the primary. Sanders had a near sweep of college towns \u2013 winning by large margins in Keene (Keene State University), Durham (University of New Hampshire) and Plymouth (Plymouth State).\u00a0 Buttigieg, however, won in Hanover (Dartmouth) with 26% of the vote. The Warren campaign deployed sizeable resources to campuses across the state, in addition to Sanders' operation. Claremont is the quintessential blue-collar, post-industrial Obama-Trump town with abandoned mills lining the Sugar River. This is where the lowest household income rates are statewide, at just over $46,000. While Barack Obama had sizable wins here in 2008 and 2012, Mr. Trump's campaign rocked the city in 2016. Although Buttigieg put sizeable resources into the city, opening up an office downtown, Sanders scored the most votes (33%), with Buttigieg in second (25%). In 2020, Laconia became a regular stomping ground for Democrats when the heavily Republican city chose a Democratic mayor in 2019. His endorsement went to Klobuchar, but the city went to Buttigieg (25%), followed closely by Sanders (24%) and Klobuchar (21%). Buttigieg walked away with the majority of purple and red Boston suburbs in New Hampshire's Southern tier. The former South Bend mayor won by healthy margins in Republican Salem, Windham and Londonderry. These upper-class neighborhoods are saturated with the kind of voter that might just switch parties for the right candidate. Bedford, an equally affluent Republican town just south of Manchester, went to Klobuchar by a slim margin. Windham and Bedford represent two of just three towns that chose Hillary Clinton in 2016. And while ideologically right leaning, Warren's disappointing performance in these communities so close to her native Massachusetts reinforced her disappointing performance.\u00a0 Klobuchar was out-competed in terms of staff and visits here in New Hampshire. The Minnesota Senator had just 30 full-time staff members one week before the primary. Compare that to Sanders (150+), Buttigieg (71), Senator Elizabeth Warren (65+), Biden (55) and Andrew Yang (50). She visited New Hampshire fewer times than any other candidate in the month of January \u2013 attending just one event in state. Yet the Minnesota senator earned the endorsement of 3 out of 4 Democratic leaders in the New Hampshire legislature, multiple state senators and mayors across the state. She made frequent visits to nursing homes across the state and was the first candidate to roll out a policy plan for senior citizens, notable in America's fastest aging state.\u00a0 \"If you feel like you need to pick between childcare for your kids and long term care for your parents, I know you,\" Klobuchar told voters in the final days of her campaign. Nearly two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire are above the age of 45. Over two-thirds of those ultimately choosing Klobuchar decided in February, underlining the importance of the New Hampshire debate stage for fickle Granite Staters who were still making up their minds. While it's likely the Senator won votes away from Biden, anecdotally, dozens of voters I spoke with in New Hampshire wanted to elect a female candidate. After Gillibrand and Harris dropped out of the race, voters I spoke with again said it was \"either Amy or Liz,\" and \"I'll decide in the ballot box.\" While Klobuchar's third place finish proved New Hampshire results can still surprise, candidates who committed months to campaigning in state \u2013 Michael Bennet, Deval Patrick, Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang \u2013 failed to break out, and all but Gabbard ended their campaigns. While Yang's New Hampshire polling earned him a consistent spot on the DNC debate stage, their relentless retail politicking here did not pay off.\u00a0While New Hampshire voters pride themselves in being \"independent thinkers,\" it is clear Iowa gave Buttigieg a bump. As the former South Bend mayor declared victory, he also picked up in the polls, with voters citing his caucus success as proof of his \"electability.\" In other words, if voters ultimately want to pick a winner, they'll likely pick someone who wins. One hundred thirty of New Hampshire's 238 townships voted for Sanders. Not a single one chose Biden or Warren. Sanders performed better among men than women. He won the support of men by 31% to 23% over Buttigieg. Women were more divided in their vote with Buttigieg (25%), slightly ahead of Klobuchar (23%) and Sanders (23%).\u00a0 Sanders' support was 8 points lower among women than among men.\u00a0 Klobuchar did well among white women with a college degree, winning 30% of their support, besting the field. Elizabeth Warren mustered just 14% of this group. Sanders was the top vote-getter among those with lower-incomes, while Buttigieg did well with those with higher incomes. Sanders got 40% of those earning under $50,000 a year, beating Buttigieg (16%) by double-digits with this group. Biden received 10% support from this group.\u00a0 Among New Hampshire Democrats with incomes of $100,000 or more, Buttigieg (34%) led the field, followed by Klobuchar (21%), and Sanders (18%). As he did in 2016, Sanders won the support of young voters \u2013 those ages 18 to 29. He won 51% of that group \u2013 one of his strongest demographic groups. Klobuchar did best among seniors getting 31% of their support, followed by Buttigieg (24%). Sanders came in at a distant third with 15%. Buttigieg's share of the vote was fairly consistent across age groups, but he had a bit more support among older voters. APP-REHENSIVE The Nevada State Democratic Party\u00a0outlined\u00a0new details of its revised tabulation and reporting process for its upcoming caucuses on February 22, according to\u00a0Tin. Early voting kicks off for Democrats in the state on Saturday. \"In choosing the best path forward our guiding principles have been security, efficiency, and simplicity,\" state party executive director Alana Mounce wrote in the memo. To replace software scrapped after the technological snafus that delayed the reporting of results in the Iowa caucuses, volunteer precinct chairs will be provided with iPads pre-loaded with a \"caucus calculator\" to assist them in tabulating results from both caucus-goers in the room and from the early voting.\u00a0 First described as a \"tool,\" the existence of which\u00a0CBS News\u00a0first reported on Friday, the state party says the \"caucus calculator\" will be \"accessed through a secure Google web form.\" Data from the early vote will be accessible through both the iPads and a paper copy. Volunteers will report the outcome of their precincts \"through a secure hotline\" to the state party, which will be later verified by one more additional source. The state party says it consulted with the Democratic National Committee, Department of Homeland Security, independent experts, and Google in order to develop their process. Many of the new \"caucus calculator\" features mirror the \"caucus reporter app\" developed by Shadow for the Nevada and Iowa State Democratic Parties.\u00a0 The Shadow-produced app's primary functions had been to assist precinct chairs in calculating which candidates had met sufficient support to be considered viable for the precinct, award delegates, and report results and issues to the state party from the site, according to documents obtained by CBS News. As in the current process, precinct chairs also had the option to forego the technological assistance and calculate results by hand. The state party says it continues to conduct trial runs of the calculator and backups with its more than 3,000 volunteers, who will man caucuses across some 252 locations in the state. What's not clear at this point is whether there will be a verification system to check reported data, as there was in Iowa. Multiple sources familiar with the matter have told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0that the \"coding error\" which led to some of delays in reporting results occurred in the process of transferring data to a quality control system. Sources have said that there were not major issues with this during test runs. Shadow CEO Gerard Niemira told VICE News that results from Shadow's database were supposed to be checked in a \"quality control check environment.\" But there was a data-formatting error that caused results not to be accepted as they were moved to the verification system. \"In the process of doing that, we had some faulty code that took the data and put it into a format that made it fail the checks,\" Niemira said. \"That was throwing up flags, which took time to resolve.\" The National Democratic Training Committee focused on training Democrats to run for office and campaign, received endorsements from nine current Democratic governors on Thursday reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0\u00a0These include current Democratic Governors' Association chair Phil Murphy of New Jersey, former DGA chair Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who gave one of the Democratic responses for this year's State of the Union. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Michele Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, Jay Inslee of Washington, Laura Kelly of Kansas, Janet Mills of Maine are the others governors backing the committee. The organization provides free training through interactive online courses and live trainings, and are looking to spend $10 million on their trainings this year, with a goal of 130 live-trainings across every state. \u00a0\u00a0 The \"NDTC was crucial in helping North Carolina Democrats compete for every single seat in the General Assembly in 2018,\" Governor Cooper said in a statement. \"With redistricting on the horizon, every seat must be protected and no seat unchallenged. NDTC plays a vital role in ensuring North Carolina Democrats running for office have the tools and resources they need to be successful.\" \"If you want to be a doctor, you go to medical school. If you want to run for office or work on campaigns, you go to NDTC,\" Inslee, a former presidential candidate, added. Inslee and Cooper are both running for re-election this year. NDTC founder Kelly Dietrich says there needs to be a focus for down-ballot Democrats in 2020, and that they are \"asking candidates up and down the ballot to trust us and use our resources - having the governor of their state endorse us gives that a real boost.\" Meanwhile at the top of the ballot, DGA Chair Murphy told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0at the National Governors Association conference earlier this month that while it's still \"too early to tell\" who the Democratic nominee is, he would \"lay across the tracks to get them elected president over President Trump.\" There are 11 governors races in total for 2020, with three Democrat seats Murphy and the DGA are focusing on keeping. \"Worrying a lot about who's at the top of the ticket, or gaming that out, it's A.) too early to tell and B.) it honestly isn't that productive,\" he said. \"We spend our time focused on that which we can control\u2026 And our gameplan will be with that focus and we'll let the chips fall where they may for the presidential.\"",

            "article_content": "The chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is calling for the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) to conduct a recanvass of the caucus results amid\u00a0ongoing delays\u00a0in their release, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0Musadiq Bidar.\u00a0Tom Perez, the party's chairman, said the recanvass was necessary to ensure \"public confidence in the results.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Enough is enough,\" Perez tweeted. \"In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.\" Two sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News that the state party wasn't aware that Perez would call for a recanvass, with 97% of the results now already reported. Sources also tell CBS News that the DNC has been running the caucus operation in Iowa for at least 48 hours.\u00a0 Requests for a recanvass must come in written form from a presidential campaign, according to the state party's Iowa Delegate Selection Plan. Candidates have until Friday at noon to make a request, and that request is required to include an explanation of \"how the national delegation could be altered as a result of the problem or its correction.\" The IDP has 48 hours to respond to recanvassing requests, with a projected timeline for the review and a fee estimate and payment schedule for the campaign.\u00a0 \u00a0 In response to Perez's call for the review, IDP chair Troy Price said the IDP is prepared to conduct a recanvass should any presidential campaign ask for the audit.\u00a0 \"In such a circumstance, the IDP will audit the paper records of report, as provided by the precinct chairs and signed by representatives of presidential campaigns,\" he said in a statement. \"This is the official record of the Iowa Democratic caucus, and we are committed to ensuring the results accurately reflect the preference of Iowans.\" The state party, he said, owes it to Iowa Democrats, volunteers and caucus-goers \"to remain focused on collecting and reviewing incoming results.\"\u00a0 The IDP defines a recanvass as \"a hand audit of Caucus Math Worksheets and Reporting Forms to ensure that they were tallied and reported in the telephone intake sheets and caucus reporting application correctly.\" And this is essentially what the state party has already been doing to report the results so far. A recanvass differs from a recount. A recount is a hand count and audit of Presidential Preference Cards to ensure that caucus votes were tallied and reported correctly in the caucus worksheets and reporting forms.\u00a0 With 97% of precincts reporting, there is a razor thin margin of state delegates separating Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders for the lead in Iowa. Buttigieg has 550 delegates (26.2% percent) and Sanders has 547 (26.1% percent). Following them are Elizabeth Warren (18.2%), Joe Biden (15.8%) and Amy Klobuchar (12.2%). More than two days after the Iowa caucuses began, results have still not been reported from 3% of the precincts around the state. While the IDP is calling \"the accuracy and integrity of the results\" a priority, there were some data that raised questions on the party's site. A CBS News analysis of data on the IDP's website found that there were more than 70 precincts where there was a higher total of participants listed on the second alignment than the initial alignment. It's not immediately clear whether any statewide delegate equivalents (SDEs) were impacted. Those ultimately determine how many national delegates a candidate wins. But the reporting discrepancies have raised questions about the data. It also isn't immediately clear what led to those numbers that were reported. The analysis was based on the reports of data that were presented to the public by the IDP. CBS News has reached out to the IDP about any of the issues in data on the website, but has not received a response. In a statement to the New York Times, IDP communications director Mandy McClure said the party is reporting numbers they received on documents provided by precinct chairs.\u00a0 \"The caucus math work sheet is the official report on caucus night to the I.D.P., and the I.D.P. reports the results as delivered by the precinct chair,\" McClure said. \"This form must be signed by the caucus chair, the caucus secretary and representatives from each campaign in the room who attest to its accuracy. Under the rules of the delegate selection process, delegates are awarded based off the record of results as provided by each precinct caucus chair.\" There have been some reports circulating on social media of instances where a candidate won the second alignment, but lost the SDEs. CBS News found 12 instances of this, but all of them were in precincts with only 1 delegate going to the county convention.\u00a0 In those precincts there is only one round of alignment and even if a candidate has the most people supporting them, the room as a whole elects the delegate to the county convention. That delegate needs a majority of people to vote for them. So, if more than half of the room votes for a delegate supporting a different candidate than the one with the most supporters, that candidate wins the delegate and the SDEs.\u00a0 For example, in Polk 72, Sanders had the most people supporting him in the precinct, but when it came time to elect the delegate, and thus allocate the SDEs, Biden's delegate received more votes. As such, Biden won the SDEs from the precinct. The reporting of results from Monday's caucuses was initially delayed in part because of\u00a0issues with a mobile phone app\u00a0that was intended to collect and transmit caucus results. Precinct chairs who used a hotline to report the results to the Iowa Democratic Party also ran into problems, as they reported long wait times before connecting with party officials. \u00a0\u00a0 The delayed process in the reporting of results has led both Sanders and Buttigieg to claim victory. Both have moved on to campaigning in New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Tuesday.\u00a0While Buttigieg maintains a slight edge in delegates,\u00a0Sanders told supporters\u00a0Wednesday during an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, that his campaign is \"winning the popular initial vote by some 6,000 votes.\" PETE BUTTIGIEG Three days after Pete Buttigieg declared victory in Iowa, the former South Bend mayor said the campaign is \"absolutely electrified\" but he did not repeat his victory claim, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0 At a veterans event Thursday afternoon, Buttigieg said this last week has been \"extraordinary,\" but noted that he has work to do in order to convince New Hampshire voters to support him. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Bernie Sanders is leading most polls in the first-in-the-nation primary state. \"We are absolutely electrified by the energy that we are coming here with and by the extraordinary validation of this campaign's vision that we had in Iowa on Monday,\" Buttigieg said. But, he added: \"New Hampshire is not the kind of place to let Iowa or anybody else tell you what to do.\" Buttigieg first declared victory late Monday night without any verified results from the state party. While campaigning in Laconia, New Hampshire, on Tuesday, Buttigieg said it was an \"astonishing victory\" for the campaign after he was shown leading the state delegate equivalents (SDEs) count. With 97% of precincts reporting results on Thursday, Buttigieg held a razor-thin lead in the SDEs count ahead of Sanders. But as of Thursday, Sanders led Buttigieg in the popular vote. Buttigieg's campaign also announced in an email to supporters that they have raised $2.7 million from more than 60,000 donors since Tuesday morning. BERNIE SANDERS Senator Bernie Sanders\u00a0lambasted the Iowa Democratic Party\u00a0for its inability to get the results of the Iowa caucuses out quickly, and he claimed victory in the popular vote in the caucuses, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. \"We are ... in Manchester, New Hamsphire, today, holding a press conference that should have occurred three nights ago in Des Moines, Iowa, but for the inability of the Iowa Democratic Party to count votes in a timely fashion,\" he said. \"That screwup has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa. It has been unfair to the candidates, all of the candidates and all of their supporters.\"\u00a0 He thanked the people of Iowa \"for the very strong victory they gave us in the Iowa caucuses Monday night,\" even though the results have still not been released in full. \"Our campaign is winning the popular initial vote by some 6,000 votes,\" he said, adding that in the realignment, he is leading by 2,500 votes. Pete Buttigieg leads in the count of state delegate equivalents (SDEs), which determines how Iowa's delegates will be apportioned in the race for the nomination. But Sanders called the difference separating the two \"meaningless\" because both Buttigieg and Sanders are likely to receive the same number of national delegates, given the small difference between them in SDEs. Sanders also called Iowa's caucus \"far too complicated.\" The Iowa Democratic Party has still not finished releasing its results. As of late Thursday morning, he was close behind Pete Buttigieg in the Iowa caucus results with 26.1% and 97% of the results reported. Potentially complicating the issue is that Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez has called for an immediate recanvass of the caucuses. Sanders' presidential campaign also announced Thursday it will ramp up staffing in Super Tuesday states and make an aggressive $5.5 million television and digital ad buy in 10 states. That will include an expansion of prior investments in Texas and California, following a $25 million January fundraising haul. \"Bernie's multiracial, multigenerational, people-driven movement for change is fueling 2020's most aggressive campaign for president,\" Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said. \"Working class Americans giving $18 at a time are putting our campaign in a strong position to compete in states all over the map.\" The investment follows the campaign's single best fundraising month to date with over 1.3 million donations from more than 648,000 people. More than 219,000 new donors gave in January. \"Teacher\" was the most common occupation of Sanders' January donors. The five most common employers were Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, the United States Postal Service and Target. The average donation was $18.72. ANDREW YANG Andrew Yang's presidential campaign is cutting loose \"dozens\" of staffers following a disappointing showing in Iowa,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports. The firings include the national policy and political directors, as well as the deputy national policy director. The Yang campaign denied parts of a report in Politico, saying these were not \"senior\" level officials.\u00a0 \"As part of our original plans following the Iowa caucuses, we are winding down our Iowa operations and restructuring to compete as the New Hampshire primary approaches,\" Yang campaign manager Zach Graumann said in a statement. Yang's campaign spent nearly $7 million on TV ads in Iowa from November to caucus night, per Kantar Media Group, and spent $19M in Q4 despite raising $16.5M. Yang also spent 20 days in Iowa and did 76 events leading up to the caucus. Though the results are not final, Andrew Yang appears to have placed a distant sixth in Iowa, netting 1% of SDEs. NEW HAMPSHIRE In the shadow of Iowa's caucus debacle, Granite State officials gathered at the Capitol Building to reassure the public that \"New Hampshire is going to get it right\" in its primary on February 11, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"When our citizens cast their ballot, they know their vote will be counted correctly with integrity, and on time,\" Governor Chris Sununu told reporters. \"But given the news and uncertainty out of Iowa, I want to ensure the public that the systems we have in place here in New Hampshire are truly beyond reproach. We are the first in the nation primary state. And while Iowa has a caucus, we are the first true primary election of the 2020 calendar, and we've earned that honor over the past 100 years.\"\u00a0 While 6,000 election officials will run poll stations across the state come primary day, Attorney General Gordon McDonald announced 50 investigators, attorneys and officials from his office will also patrol ballot boxes. Each of New Hampshire's 309 polling locations are required to fill out a seven-page polling place checklist before voting begins. \"Our constitution requires that each moderator actually publicly announce the vote before they leave that polling place that night,\" Secretary of State Bill Gardner said. This primary marks New Hampshire's 100th year of voting first. Thirty-three candidates will appear on the Democratic ballot. Meanwhile, a new\u00a0Monmouth University poll\u00a0released Thursday shows Senator Bernie Sanders in the lead just five days before the first-in-the-nation primary, reports\u00a0Sganga. At 24% the lawmaker from nearby Vermont jumped 6 points from last month's New Hampshire poll released by Monmouth University. \u00a0 Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Former Vice President Joe Biden came in second, earning 20% and 17% of support respectively. Senator Elizabeth Warren follows at 13%, with Senator Amy Klobuchar at 9%, and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang tied at 4%. \u00a0 As CBS News previously reported, the delayed results out of Iowa seem to have had little effect on New Hampshire voters. According to the Monmouth poll, 62% of respondents said the caucuses did not influence feelings about their current presidential pick. The survey also showed just 49% of likely Democratic primary voters have made up their minds on who they'll vote for, while 46% said there's a possibility they'll change their mind. AD WARS 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are ramping up ad buys in New Hampshire ahead of its first in the nation primary February 11. As of now, candidates have spent more than $43 million dollars on ads in the state. According to Kantar Campaign Media Analysis Group, Tom Steyer has spent the most with nearly $20 million, Bernie Sanders has spent nearly $6 million, Pete Buttigieg and Andrew Yang have each spent nearly $4 million and Elizabeth Warren has spent more than $1.5 million reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0 This comes this week as Warren invested $36,000 into New Hampshire while pulling money from other early states. At the same time, Amy Klobuchar this week invested another $430,000 on ads in New Hampshire, bringing her total spending to nearly $1.5 million in the Granite state as well. Meanwhile, Biden is lagging behind on ad spending in New Hampshire. His campaign and the Unite the Country PAC that supports him have spent less than $1 million in New Hampshire. On Thursday morning, Unite the Country released a new ad in New Hampshire that makes the case that Biden's plans to expand health care, fight climate change and take on the NRA are \"achievable,\" perhaps a veiled dig at other candidates. However, Biden and Unite the Country's ad spending in the state is even less than what Deval Patrick and his supporting super PAC Reason to Believe PAC are currently spending in New Hampshire, with a combined $1.9 million. In fact, yesterday Biden pulled $4,200 in ads out of New Hampshire along with nearly $175,000 out of South Carolina. Meanwhile, as candidates focus in on New Hampshire, the campaigns are shuffling their ad spend in Nevada, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, per Kantar CMAG data. Joe Biden's total in the state this week dropped briefly by around $60,000, before returning to\u00a0above the original amount. Bernie Sanders has expanded\u00a0his own future reservations\u00a0as Elizabeth Warren drew down some flights in the state, which\u00a0the Massachusetts senator explained\u00a0as being \"careful about how we spend our money.\" And on Wednesday, Warren's campaign manager suggested an aide for Pete Buttigieg\u00a0tweeted instructions to a Super PAC\u00a0about a possible ad in the state. The former South Bend mayor, as well as an outside group\u00a0that has aired ads backing him\u00a0in the past, currently has no future reservations in Nevada. The shuffling comes as Bernie Sanders is also moving full speed ahead toward Super Tuesday, reports\u00a0Ewall-Wice. Today, his campaign announced\u00a0it raised a whopping $25 million\u00a0in the month of January alone and that the campaign will invest $5.5 million in television and digital ad buys in 10 states. The only other candidate currently airing ads in all of those states holding contests on March 3 is billionaire Mike Bloomberg. IN THE HOUSE With less than a month to go, the Republican primary for former-Congressman Duncan Hunter's old California 50th district is turning into a battle of old and new. Carl DeMaio, who also ran for Congress in 2014, is known in the area for his conservative talk show, and he served on the San Diego City Council. He heads into 2020 with\u00a0$1.73 million\u00a0cash on hand. His opponent Darrell Issa, who used to represent the neighboring California 49th District, brought in less money during the fourth quarter but has a similar war chest with\u00a0$1.61 million\u00a0- in part thanks to a $1.2 million\u00a0loan\u00a0listed in his FEC report. \u00a0 CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says Issa picked up two notable conservative endorsements on Thursday: former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Both campaigns have been trying to \"out-Trump\" each other. Issa Communications Director Greg Blair criticized DeMaio's stance on Roe v. Wade and labeled him as a \"pro-amnesty, Never Trump liberal\" in a statement, while Demaio tweeted a video compilation of Issa's comments calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian involvement in 2016's elections. The district's primaries are on March 3, and the Democratic front runner Ammar Campa-Najjar is looking for another shot after narrowly losing to Hunter by less than four points in 2018. Editor's note: This article previously said that Carl DeMaio has never held public office, but in fact, he served on the San Diego City Council. This has been updated.",

            "article_content": " \r\n\tThe New York Times announced late Sunday night its endorsement for the presidency. For the first time, it bestowed its stamp of approval on two candidates, Elizabeth Warren\u200b and Amy Klobuchar\u200b, both sitting senators who represent divergent strains in the Democratic Party\u200b.\r\n \r\n\tThe Times editorial board, noting that voters are faced with a choice among three very different visions in 2020, decried the incumbent, President Trump, as the choice who is leading the GOP into \"white nativism at home and America First unilateralism abroad.\" Then, there are the Democrats who split between those who think Mr. Trump is \"an aberration\" and \"a more sensible America\" might still be possible, and those who see the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as representing a system that needs to be annihilated and replaced.\r\n \r\n\tThe editorial board spent over 12 hours interviewing the field. Its two endorsements appear to have more to do with the conditions of the country than the candidates they considered. The board said its history of endorsements leans toward the candidate \"with a more traditional approach to pushing the nation forward, within the realities of a constitutional framework.\" But not now.\r\n \r\n\tThe board said that, given the events of the past few years, it wonders \"whether our democratic system is fundamentally broken.\" It lamented the state of our elections, heightened partisanship, foreign misinformation campaigns, the rivers of cash in our politics and the disappearing American dream.\r\n \r\n\tSo, the board found itself torn between being \"open to new ideas\" and seeking stability. It wound up endorsing what it concluded were the best candidates for each approach: Warren and Klobuchar.\r\n \r\n\tKlobuchar\u00a0called the endorsement an \"honor,\" and Warren quipped the two candidates are \"both undefeated in elections and undefeated in New York Times endorsements!\"\r\n \r\n\tThe board praised Warren for her rhetoric on how the economic system has failed working and poor Americans and her commitment to reforming government structures, and said she's demonstrated \"a serious approach to policymaking that some of the other candidates lack.\"\u00a0\r\n \r\n\tThe board was also impressed by her work in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and assessed that she possesses a \"sophisticated understanding of the different levers of power in an administration.\"\r\n \r\n\tThe ed board expressed some doubts about her political instincts, which sometimes lapse into an \"us-versus-them\" view it said might be limited in a race against Mr. Trump, who has a competing notion of \"them and us.\"\r\n \r\n\tShe blames business for too many of society's ills, the Times suggests, writing that \"the country needs a more unifying path.\"\r\n \r\n\tIn a polarized environment, the Times board sees Klobuchar \"as a standard-bearer for the Democratic center\" and suggests \"the best chance to enact many progressive plans could be under a Klobuchar administration.\"\r\n \r\n\tThe board admires her ability to speak with empathy about climate change, the shrinking middle class, guns and trade. And in her 13 years in the Senate, she has a foreign policy record that \"shows that she is confident and thoughtful, and she reacts to data \u2014 what you'd want in a crisis.\"\r\n \r\n\tHowever, the Times board voiced concerns over\u00a0reports of how Senator Klobuchar treats her staff\u00a0because of fears it could hamper her ability to hire talented staffers. Though \"to be fair,\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0\u2014 not to mention\u00a0former Vice President Biden\u00a0\u2014 also have reputations for sometimes berating their staffs, and it is rarely mentioned as a political liability,\" the Times noted.\r\n",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders had an impressive win last night in the Nevada caucuses. He also won in the New Hampshire primary and leads the Democratic field in national polls. It's a stunning turn of events for a man who calls himself a \"democratic socialist,\" and is the first to admit he's been preaching the same populist, progressive message for decades.\u00a0 As the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, then a U.S. congressman, now an independent senator who caucuses with the Democrats, Sanders has been arguing that the very rich should pay higher taxes so that everyone can have health care, education, and a decent paying job. Sanders is 78 years old, and is filling arenas with huge crowds of young, enthusiastic supporters. He's used to being the underdog, but now, grudgingly, has to admit: in the Democratic race for president, he's the front-runner. Anderson Cooper: After your entire career, to now be the front-runner of the Democratic Party-- Bernie Sanders: Yes, that is a bit shocking. I will agree. I will agree with you there. Anderson Cooper: The Democratic Party has moved to you, if anything? Bernie Sanders: In many ways, they have. And-- and the ideas that seemed radical four years ago are now kind of mainstream.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: The ideas are still pretty radical. I mean you've been saying with pride that you're making a lot of people nervous. You said, \"Wall Street's getting nervous, the insurance industry's getting nervous, drug companies are getting nervous, and the Democratic establishment is getting nervous.\" Bernie Sanders: Yep, that's what I said. Bernie Sanders at a rally: You know what? They should be getting nervous! Anderson Cooper: You're also making, though, a lot of Democratic voters nervous. Bernie Sanders: I don't think so. I-- look, you know, you have a lot of candidates out there. And each candidate has his or her supporters. Anderson Cooper: But a lot of voters are voting for candidates who aren't calling for Medicare for All, who aren't calling for a revolution. Is everybody really wanting a revolution like that? Bernie Sanders: Yeah, let's go easy on the word rev-- \"political revolution\", you know? We're-- we're trying to follow-- Anderson Cooper: Y-- you're the one who's using the word. Bernie Sanders: Well, I mean, you know, but I don't want people, you know, to overstate that. But here is the point. It's not good enough to complain, \"Oh, I cannot afford my health care. I can't afford childcare. I can't afford to send my kid to college. I'm paying half of my income in rent.\" You know? If you're not happy about that, you got to be involved in the political process. Only millions of people standing up for justice can bring about the kind of change that this country requires. And I believe that has got to happen. Sanders says the change he envisions most closely resembles Scandanavian and European countries with democratic governments and comprehensive social programs. But that's certainly not how President Trump has characterized it.\u00a0 And it's not just President Trump. At the debate this past week in Las Vegas, this is how former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg responded to one of Sanders' proposals to require greater employee ownership of large companies.\u00a0 Michael Bloomberg: I can't think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get re-elected than listening to this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're not going to throw out capitalism.\u00a0 We tried that.  Other countries tried that.  It was called communism.  And it just didn't work. Anderson Cooper: You said it was a cheap shot that he said that. What's going to happen on the stage w-- with President Trump, he's going to be doing shots all the time on you, on this. Bernie Sanders: And you know what? We will fight back. And this is what we will bring up. We will bring up is that the president of the United States is a pathological liar. And it is increasingly clear that many people just don't believe anything that he says. He is a fraud. I look forward to taking him on. Anderson Cooper: What is democratic socialism? Bernie Sanders: When Donald Trump was a private businessman in New York, he got $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing. That's called corporate socialism. What democratic socialism is about is saying, 'Let's use the federal government to protect the interests of working families.' Back in the 1980s, Sanders had some positive things to say about the former Soviet Union and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. \u00a0 Here he is explaining why the Cuban people didn't rise up and help the U.S. overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro: \"\u2026he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society, you know?\" Bernie Sanders: We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad. You know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it? Anderson Cooper: A lot of p-- dissidents imprisoned in-- in Cuba. Bernie Sanders: That's right. And we condemn that. Unlike Donald Trump, let's be clear, you want to-- I do not think that Kim Jong Un is a good friend. I don't trade love letters with a murdering dictator. Vladimir Putin, not a great friend of mine. A month ago, Sanders was told by U.S. intelligence that Vladimir Putin's government has been attempting to help his campaign. And last week, lawmakers were briefed that Moscow is also trying to help re-elect President Trump. On Friday, Sanders offered this message to Putin: \"As president of the United States, Mr. Putin, you will not interfere in our elections.'' Anderson Cooper: You believe winning absolutely relies on a voter turnout that this country's never seen before? Bernie Sanders: That's right. I-- I think-- look, anyone who tells you that Donald Trump is not gonna be a tough opponent is kidding themselves. The way you beat Trump is bring nontraditional voters into the political process. Anderson Cooper: Donald Trump got elected talking to white middle-class Americans, white working-class Americans, promising to-- to make America great again. Your stump speech, your critics say sounds like nothing works in America, hasn't for generations. Is America great? Bernie Sanders: In many ways, we are. In some ways, very significant ways, we're not. We're not great when half of our people today are living paycheck to paycheck. When 500,000 people tonight are going to be sleeping out on the streets, including 30,000 veterans. You know, my father came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. Couldn't speak a word of English, had very limited education. We are a great nation, because people like my father would never have dreamed in a million years that their kids would become United States senators or be successful in many other ways. Anderson Cooper: How much of your political beliefs are based on your experiences growing up in Brooklyn-- with your family? Bernie Sanders: A lot, Anderson, a lot. I grew up-- and I don't want to hear-- anyone to think I'm-- we were desperately poor. We were not. My father worked every day of his life. He worked very hard, just never made a whole lot of money. And, you know, as a kid, this stays with you your whole life. These are the things you don't forget. The incredible arguments between my mom and my dad-- over money-- you know? Why didn't we have enough money to do this? And should we buy this and do that? And why are you buying this clothing? And bah bah bah bah. Anderson Cooper: Your mom got sick when you were a teenager.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders: Mhmm.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: Does that inform your view on medical policy, on Medicare for All, and all of that? Bernie Sanders: I don't like to, you know, talk about personal stuff that much. But it does. Anderson Cooper: It's interesting you don't like to talk a lot about personal stuff. Most people running on a campaign, they want people to know that side of them. Why do you think that's not important? Bernie Sanders: I'm not saying that's not important. I'm a kind of-- private person in a sense. And I-- and I-- you know, I'm not particularly anxious to tell the world about everything personal in my life. Anderson Cooper: One of the things obviously people do know about is you had a heart attack a few months ago. If-- if you're elected, running for a second term, you'd be 82 years old.\u00a0 Somebody running for a second term at 82, shouldn't that give voters pause? Bernie Sanders: Well, I haven't won the first term yet, so let's--we'll see what happens on the second term. Being old has an advantage in the sense that the issues that I fight for are not new to me. Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you in the Senate, Joe Biden has said that you never got anything done.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders: Pssst Anderson Cooper: Amy Klobuchar has been-- are you getting mad? Bernie Sanders: I'm not mad\u2013 just silently hissing, that's all. (LAUGH) Anderson Cooper: Amy Klobuchar says to be a progressive, you need to make progress, implying you haven't. A Georgetown University study that you had one of the worst records for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate. Bernie Sanders: Oh boy, dead wrong, dead wrong, dead wrong. When I was in the House, year after year after year, I passed more bipartisan amendments than anybody else in the House. Anderson Cooper: In terms of getting your bills through Congress, we found, I think, what, seven bills that you were the primary sponsor on that got enacted. Two of them were-- involved naming Post Office buildings. Bernie Sanders: Yeah, but if you look at the Affordable Care Act, my name was not on that bill. But you speak to anybody in Congress, I led the effort to bring $11 billion more into community health centers and expand-- primary health care in this country. I mean, the-- as you well know, Anderson, Congress is a complicated place. There's profound skepticism in Congress about Sanders' ability to get his agenda passed. Two-thirds of Democrats in the Senate have not signed on to \"Medicare for All,\" which would cost an estimated $30 trillion to $40 trillion over ten years. And that's just one of Bernie Sanders' many proposals. There's also free public college, cancellation of all student debt, a federal job guarantee, and a Green New Deal to rapidly reduce carbon emissions. Anderson Cooper: How much will that cost? Bernie Sanders: Obviously, those are expensive propositions, but we have done our best on issue after issue-- in paying for them. Anderson Cooper: Do you know how all-- how much though? I mean, do you have a price tag for-- for all of this? Bernie Sanders: We do. I mean, you know, and-- and-- the price tag is-- it will be substantially less than letting the current system go. I think it's about $30 trillion. Anderson Cooper: That's just for Medicare for All, you're talking about? Bernie Sanders: That's just Medicare for All, yes. Anderson Cooper: Do you have-- a price tag for all of these things? Bernie Sanders: No, I don't. We try to-- no, you mentioned making public colleges and universities tuition free and cancelling all student debt, that's correct. That's what I want to do. We pay for that through a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. Anderson Cooper: But you say you don't know what the total price is, but you know how it's gonna be paid for. How do you know it's gonna be paid for if you don't know how much the price is? Bernie Sanders: Well, I can't-- you know, I can't rattle off to you ever nickel and every dime. But we have accounted for-- you-- you talked about Medicare for All. We have options out there that will pay for it. Taxes on corporations and billionaires are the primary options he's proposed. But to finance Medicare for All, middle-class families would also pay an additional 4% tax on their income over $29,000. Sanders says they'll end up saving money because they won't have to pay premiums, co-pays, or deductibles. But under Medicare for All, nearly 160 million Americans will have to give up their private health insurance. Anderson Cooper: Isn't that a dangerous message for Democrats to say, \"You know what? We're gonna take away your private insurance. We're-- we're gonna give you something better--\" Bernie Sanders: Let's talk about-- Anderson Cooper: \"--run by the government.\" A lot of people don't trust that. Bernie Sanders: It's not run by the government. Medicare allows you to go to any doctor you want for better or worse, this is not socialized medicine. This is keeping the same system intact, but getting rid of the private insurance companies, giving people another card, which allows them complete freedom. Though he's campaigning as a champion for the poor, Bernie Sanders became a millionaire four years ago, thanks largely to royalties from his bestselling book, \"Our Revolution.\"\u00a0 His Democratic rivals have given him some grief about it during the debates. Anderson Cooper: You know what they're getting at. They're-- they're suggesting the it's hypocritical, it's criticism-- Bernie Sanders: We pay our fair share of taxes. He doesn't think billionaires like Michael Bloomberg are paying their fair share, nor does he think much of the job Bloomberg did as mayor. Bernie Sanders: I think the more people understand Bloomberg's record as mayor of New York, where he engaged in horrifically racist policies of stop and frisk, people in America don't want that. Anderson Cooper: You have promised to support the Democratic nominee. Personally, though, the idea of you going out campaigning for Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire, how would that even work? Bernie Sanders: I-- Anderson Cooper: I mean can you honestly tell your supporters to support-- Bernie Sanders: Well, I-- I think this is the problem of a Bloomberg candidacy. It's not just my supporters, he is not going to be a strong candidate. But, what I have said, and you quoted me correctly, is I said on day one I will support the Democratic nominee, no matter who that nominee may be. At the end of our interview, Sanders unveiled a new plan that would guarantee free, high-quality child care and pre-kindergarten to every kid in the country from infancy to age four. \u00a0Bernie Sanders: So what we are calling for is universal childcare.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: How are you going to pay for this? Bernie Sanders: We have a tax on wealth to pay for that.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: For all the people who like the idea of it, there are going to be a lot of Democrats, again, who are saying, \"Well, wait a minute, yet again, this is another program that-- it's not clear how it's going to get paid for.\" Bernie Sanders: Well, listen-- Anderson Cooper: --it's just going to add to-- Bernie Sanders: It is clear how it's going to be paid for. Look, Anderson-- Anderson Cooper: More taxes. Bernie Sanders: It's taxes on billionaires. You know? You know, I get a little bit tired of hearing my opponents saying-- \"Gee, how you going to pay for a program that impacts and helps children or working-class families or middle-class families? How you going to pay for that?\" And yet, where are people saying, \"How are you going to pay for over $750 billion on military spending?\" How you going to pay for a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the 1% in large corporations which was what Trump did? When you help the billionaires and you help Wall Street, \"Hey! Of course we can pay for it. That's what America's supposed to be about.\" Well, I disagree. Produced by Andy Court and Evie Salomon.

I grew up-- and I don't want to hear-- anyone to think I'm-- we were desperately poor. We were not. My father worked every day of his life. He worked very hard, just never made a whole lot of money. And, you know, as a kid, this stays with you your whole life. These are the things you don't forget. The incredible arguments between my mom and my dad-- over money-- you know? Why didn't we have enough money to do this? And should we buy this and do that? And why are you buying this clothing? And bah bah bah bah. Anderson Cooper: Your mom got sick when you were a teenager.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders: Mhmm.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: Does that inform your view on medical policy, on Medicare for All, and all of that? Bernie Sanders: I don't like to, you know, talk about personal stuff that much. But it does. Anderson Cooper: It's interesting you don't like to talk a lot about personal stuff. Most people running on a campaign, they want people to know that side of them. Why do you think that's not important? Bernie Sanders: I'm not saying that's not important. I'm a kind of-- private person in a sense. And I-- and I-- you know, I'm not particularly anxious to tell the world about everything personal in my life. Anderson Cooper: One of the things obviously people do know about is you had a heart attack a few months ago. If-- if you're elected, running for a second term, you'd be 82 years old.\u00a0 Somebody running for a second term at 82, shouldn't that give voters pause? Bernie Sanders: Well, I haven't won the first term yet, so let's--we'll see what happens on the second term. Being old has an advantage in the sense that the issues that I fight for are not new to me. Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you in the Senate, Joe Biden has said that you never got anything done.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders: Pssst Anderson Cooper: Amy Klobuchar has been-- are you getting mad? Bernie Sanders: I'm not mad\u2013 just silently hissing, that's all. (LAUGH) Anderson Cooper: Amy Klobuchar says to be a progressive, you need to make progress, implying you haven't. A Georgetown University study that you had one of the worst records for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate. Bernie Sanders: Oh boy, dead wrong, dead wrong, dead wrong. When I was in the House, year after year after year, I passed more bipartisan amendments than anybody else in the House. Anderson Cooper: In terms of getting your bills through Congress, we found, I think, what, seven bills that you were the primary sponsor on that got enacted. Two of them were-- involved naming Post Office buildings. Bernie Sanders: Yeah, but if you look at the Affordable Care Act, my name was not on that bill. But you speak to anybody in Congress, I led the effort to bring $11 billion more into community health centers and expand-- primary health care in this country. I mean, the-- as you well know, Anderson, Congress is a complicated place. There's profound skepticism in Congress about Sanders' ability to get his agenda passed. Two-thirds of Democrats in the Senate have not signed on to \"Medicare for All,\" which would cost an estimated $30 trillion to $40 trillion over ten years. And that's just one of Bernie Sanders' many proposals. There's also free public college, cancellation of all student debt, a federal job guarantee, and a Green New Deal to rapidly reduce carbon emissions. Anderson Cooper: How much will that cost? Bernie Sanders: Obviously, those are expensive propositions, but we have done our best on issue after issue-- in paying for them. Anderson Cooper: Do you know how all-- how much though? I mean, do you have a price tag for-- for all of this? Bernie Sanders: We do. I mean, you know, and-- and-- the price tag is-- it will be substantially less than letting the current system go. I think it's about $30 trillion. Anderson Cooper: That's just for Medicare for All, you're talking about? Bernie Sanders: That's just Medicare for All, yes. Anderson Cooper: Do you have-- a price tag for all of these things? Bernie Sanders: No, I don't. We try to-- no, you mentioned making public colleges and universities tuition free and cancelling all student debt, that's correct. That's what I want to do. We pay for that through a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. Anderson Cooper: But you say you don't know what the total price is, but you know how it's gonna be paid for. How do you know it's gonna be paid for if you don't know how much the price is? Bernie Sanders: Well, I can't-- you know, I can't rattle off to you ever nickel and every dime. But we have accounted for-- you-- you talked about Medicare for All. We have options out there that will pay for it. Taxes on corporations and billionaires are the primary options he's proposed. But to finance Medicare for All, middle-class families would also pay an additional 4% tax on their income over $29,000. Sanders says they'll end up saving money because they won't have to pay premiums, co-pays, or deductibles. But under Medicare for All, nearly 160 million Americans will have to give up their private health insurance. Anderson Cooper: Isn't that a dangerous message for Democrats to say, \"You know what? We're gonna take away your private insurance. We're-- we're gonna give you something better--\" Bernie Sanders: Let's talk about-- Anderson Cooper: \"--run by the government.\" A lot of people don't trust that. Bernie Sanders: It's not run by the government. Medicare allows you to go to any doctor you want for better or worse, this is not socialized medicine. This is keeping the same system intact, but getting rid of the private insurance companies, giving people another card, which allows them complete freedom. Though he's campaigning as a champion for the poor, Bernie Sanders became a millionaire four years ago, thanks largely to royalties from his bestselling book, \"Our Revolution.\"\u00a0 His Democratic rivals have given him some grief about it during the debates. Anderson Cooper: You know what they're getting at. They're-- they're suggesting the it's hypocritical, it's criticism-- Bernie Sanders: We pay our fair share of taxes. He doesn't think billionaires like Michael Bloomberg are paying their fair share, nor does he think much of the job Bloomberg did as mayor. Bernie Sanders: I think the more people understand Bloomberg's record as mayor of New York, where he engaged in horrifically racist policies of stop and frisk, people in America don't want that. Anderson Cooper: You have promised to support the Democratic nominee. Personally, though, the idea of you going out campaigning for Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire, how would that even work? Bernie Sanders: I-- Anderson Cooper: I mean can you honestly tell your supporters to support-- Bernie Sanders: Well, I-- I think this is the problem of a Bloomberg candidacy. It's not just my supporters, he is not going to be a strong candidate. But, what I have said, and you quoted me correctly, is I said on day one I will support the Democratic nominee, no matter who that nominee may be. At the end of our interview, Sanders unveiled a new plan that would guarantee free, high-quality child care and pre-kindergarten to every kid in the country from infancy to age four. \u00a0Bernie Sanders: So what we are calling for is universal childcare.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: How are you going to pay for this? Bernie Sanders: We have a tax on wealth to pay for that.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: For all the people who like the idea of it, there are going to be a lot of Democrats, again, who are saying, \"Well, wait a minute, yet again, this is another program that-- it's not clear how it's going to get paid for.\" Bernie Sanders: Well, listen-- Anderson Cooper: --it's just going to add to-- Bernie Sanders: It is clear how it's going to be paid for. Look, Anderson-- Anderson Cooper: More taxes. Bernie Sanders: It's taxes on billionaires. You know? You know, I get a little bit tired of hearing my opponents saying-- \"Gee, how you going to pay for a program that impacts and helps children or working-class families or middle-class families? How you going to pay for that?\" And yet, where are people saying, \"How are you going to pay for over $750 billion on military spending?\" How you going to pay for a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the 1% in large corporations which was what Trump did? When you help the billionaires and you help Wall Street, \"Hey! Of course we can pay for it. That's what America's supposed to be about.\" Well, I disagree. Produced by Andy Court and Evie Salomon.

            "article_content": "Recent college graduate Emily Knell was a weekend away from starting a new job helping struggling elementary students when the coronavirus pandemic put the next phase of her life on hold. \"They cannot really give me any answers as to when I can expect to go back to work,\" she said.\u00a0 \"And since I didn't technically start, I can't get unemployment. I haven't had a paycheck since February.\" Knell, who graduated early from Pennsylvania State University last summer and moved home to work and pay off student loans before graduate school, said the virus had thrown her life into a state of \"limbo.\" \u00a0She's now working one day a week for her father, and has deferred her student loans.\u00a0   Millions of students graduating are beginning a new phase of their lives as the coronavirus pandemic shatters the world around them. They're facing the worst job market since the Great Depression, and some companies have even been forced to revoke internships and full-time job offers.\u00a0 CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Pennsylvania, over a dozen interviews with students graduating or who recently graduated from college pieced together a mosaic of stories about change, disappointment and uncertainty. New graduates have moved back home mid-semester, lost job opportunities or otherwise had their plans altered by the pandemic. Although change is inherent in graduation at every level, for members of the Class of 2020, the pandemic presents an entirely new level of uncertainty.\u00a0 In a National Association of Colleges and Employers\u00a0survey in April of over 400 employers, 22% revoked offers to interns and 4.4% revoked offers to full-time recruits.\u00a0 Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said the job market that undergraduate and graduate students are entering this year is similar to the one grads faced in 2009 after the financial crisis. \"There are employers who still think this is sort of coming back quickly, and then you get employers who say, I think it's gonna be a disaster,\" he said. \"And the problem is, when they're uncertain, they sit on their hands.\" Steven Brady of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, had passed the first two rounds of interviews for a job at a Washington state investment firm as he finished his last semester at Penn State. The company planned to fly him across the country for a final round interview, but the company called in March and said it had implemented a hiring freeze. He said that after months of searching for openings and expanding his options, he recently reached a final-round interview for a finance job back in Pennsylvania. \"At this point, I've got to take what I can get,\" he said. His family is moving to Colorado, and he had hoped to follow to a state closer to their new home, but said he'll get his own place in Pennsylvania if the job there works out.\u00a0 Many of the graduates will enter the changing workforce carrying debt from their education. A 2018 report from the Federal Reserve found that over half the college graduates under 30 at the time had accumulated debt while in school.\u00a0 \"When things are booming, it doesn't matter, there's not so many differences,\" Cappelli said. But when things turn down, for example, the students with student loans are really whacked.\" The pandemic has shaken the plans of recent high school graduates, too, with the unemployment rate soaring to nearly 35% for 18- and 19-year-olds in April. Several Pennsylvania high school graduates planning to go to college in the fall told CBS Nnews their summer plans had been upended by the pandemic.\u00a0 Dominic Oto, a graduating senior at North Allegheny High School, planned to return to a job at the local Pittsburgh amusement park where he had worked the last two summers. He hoped to save money for a car before leaving for college at St. Vincent College , but with Allegheny County still in the process of reopening, Kennywood Park hasn't opened its gates.\u00a0 \"At best, I'm only working, maybe like a month and a half, two months max. So I mean, I'm trying to save up,\" he said. \"It's pretty hard to do that, when I have no job right now.\" The economic landscape is particularly difficult to predict in the middle of a pandemic, said Charles Whiteman, the dean of the Smeal Business College at Penn State.\u00a0 \"There's an element not only of uncertainty but also of risk,\" he said. \"In 2008 [and] 2009, I think we had a reasonable idea of the kinds of things that could happen and how likely they were. Now, we didn't get it all right, obviously. But in this case, there are a number of behavioral factors that are really quite difficult to predict.\"\u00a0 Although change is inherent in graduation at every level, for members of the class of 2020 was the pandemic presents an entirely new level of uncertainty.\u00a0 \"I know there is going to be a new normal because of this. I think I am just unaware of what it's going to look like,\" said Garyney Deshommes of London, Pennsylvania, who finished a degree in government at Misericordia University in the spring. \"I don't know what to expect. I don't know what my own life is going to look like a year from now honestly.\"\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the House.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A slew of changes to the U.S. Postal Service ushered in by the new postmaster general coupled with the logjam on Capitol Hill on a deal that could provide the agency with a much-needed injection of cash has lawmakers sounding the alarm that mail delays could lead to missed deadlines for voters seeking to cast their ballots by mail. \"We need a well-functioning Post Office in all circumstances, but especially when we are trying to conduct an election that provides voters choices so they don't have to choose between their fundamental right to vote and their safety,\" Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the Brennan Center, told CBS News. \"Mail balloting is understood by all experts to be part of that solution, and that means the Post Office needs to have the resources to serve everyone in an equitable way.\" Louis DeJoy, a major GOP donor, assumed the role of postmaster general in June and has rolled out a series of cost-cutting measures that soon sparked a backlash: curtailing overtime, reorganizing the agency's top ranks and calling for late-arriving mail to be delivered the following day. In remarks\u00a0before the Postal Service Board of Governors meeting last week, DeJoy confirmed changes are underway within the agency. \"We have taken immediate steps to better adhere to our existing operating plans, which were developed precisely to ensure that we meet our present service standards in an efficient and effective manner,\" he said. \"By running our operations on time and on schedule, and by not incurring unnecessary overtime or other costs, we will enhance our ability to be sustainable and to be able to continue to provide high-quality, affordable service.\" But Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, said the changes have led to a slowdown in mail delivery and a back-up of letters and parcels. Long-term postal workers, he told CBS News, \"haven't seen anything this bad.\" While DeJoy said the overhaul is necessary to bring the Postal Service from the brink of insolvency, Republicans and Democrats are warning the backlog sparked by his changes will lead to voters missing deadlines for mail-in ballots and elderly Americans being left without their prescriptions. Montana Senator Steve Daines, a Republican, urged DeJoy to undo a July directive to hold late mail until the next day. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, met with DeJoy at the U.S. Capitol last week to underscore the issues facing the Postal Service and, like Daines, urged him to repeal his operational changes. On Wednesday, all 47 Senate Democrats told DeJoy that while delayed mail under normal circumstances is problematic, \"during a pandemic in the middle of a presidential election, it is catastrophic.\" Likewise, more than 170 House Democrats signed on to a letter expressing concern that his policies are accelerating the crisis at the agency, including directing Post Offices to no longer treat all election mail as First Class. \"If implemented now, as the election approaches, this policy will cause further delays to election mail that will disenfranchise voters and put significant financial pressure on election jurisdictions,\" they told DeJoy. \"Because many states have traditionally allowed voters to request absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots within a few days of the election, it is essential that standard delivery times remain short and pricing remain consistent.\" But DeJoy said during the Board of Governors meeting the Postal Service's delivery standards haven't changed and refuted assertions that the agency is slowing down election mail. \"If public policy makers choose to utilize the mail as a part of their election system, we will do everything we can to deliver Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards,\" he said. Recognizing the fiscal issues facing the Postal Service \u2014 it lost $9 billion last year \u2014 some lawmakers are working to shore up the agency. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney rolled out legislation Wednesday that seeks to halt any changes to the Postal Service's operations or levels of service until the pandemic subsides. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of senators also introduced legislation that would provide the Postal Service up to $25 billion for revenue losses and operational expenses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Daines, a cosponsor of the Senate bill, told DeJoy he is pushing for the measure to be included in the next coronavirus relief measure. But prospects of another legislative package passing in the near future appear dim, as talks between congressional Democratic leaders and the White House collapsed last week. In response to the impasse, Mr. Trump took unilateral action with a series of executive actions designed to provide economic relief for struggling Americans. While the president claimed his orders brought Democrats back to the negotiating table, Republicans and Democrats are pointing fingers over who is to blame for the standoff, indicating it shows no signs of abating. Dimondstein said allowing the Postal Service to creep toward bankruptcy \"gives grist for the mill for those who want to claim they want to cut, cut, cut and delay, delay, delay in the name of financial stress or cost-cutting measures.\" \"The longer they wait, the closer it gets to running out of money. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,\" he said of lawmakers. \"It's incumbent upon Congress to act.\" Dimondstein said that while there is no doubt postal workers can handle the influx of election mail expected as states expand vote-by-mail, \"any time mail slows down it degrades anything we do.\" \"There are lots of postal workers trained to expedite mail ballots, make sure they get delivered, but it would be far better in terms of the election if Congress acted with the financial emergency relief and if the Post Office reversed their regressive policies,\" he said. But Mr. Trump himself is a barrier to federal assistance to the Postal Service. In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, the president admitted starving the agency of federal money would stymie efforts to expand mail-in voting. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his opposition to voting by mail, insisting without evidence that it opens the door to potential voter fraud. \"Two of the items are the Post Office and the $3.5 billion for mail-in voting,\" Mr. Trump told Fox Business of Democrats' requests. \"If we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they can't have universal mail-in voting. It just can't happen.\"\u00a0Mr. Trump added that House Democrats, who approved $25 billion for the Postal Service in an earlier coronavirus relief measure, \"need that money in order to have the Post Office work so it can take all these millions and millions of ballots.\"\u00a0\"But if they don't get those two items that means you can't have universal mail-in voting because they're not equipped to have it,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0Last month, the Treasury Department agreed to loan the Postal Service $10 billion, but Dimondstein said the assistance cuts against the agency's mission and raises the likelihood for political interference.\u00a0\"Strings or no strings attached, the Post Office is supposed to be an apolitical agency,\" he said. \"For Treasury to have their finger on the rudder like this is really bad and it runs counter to the existence of the modern Post Office.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Delaware Senator Chris Coons that aired Sunday, September 27, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He's in Wilmington. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Good morning, MARGARET, great to be on with you again. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Mark Meadows confidence and the timeline in the confirmation of Judge Barrett. You're laughing. It doesn't seem, though, that the Democrats can do much to stop it. Will Democrats do anything to slow it down? Will they boycott hearings? How serious are you about trying to throw sand in the gears? SEN. COONS: MARGARET, what I was shaking my head about was having just heard Mark Meadows breathlessly trying to support President Trump's desperate efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of this election. We should not be barreling forward with this partisan nomination. There's only 37 days until the election. There is no precedent in American history for a president filling a vacancy this close to an election, where I'll remind you, more than half of the American states are already voting. We should be waiting until after the election. We should honor Justice Ginsburg's dying wish that the people should choose the next president, the next president choose her successor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Eisenhower recess-appointed Brennan 22 days before the election, but I understand that was without Senate consent. So I hear your point. But the question was, are Democrats going to do anything to slow this down? Some of your colleagues are saying they won't even meet with the nominee. What will you ask or when you meet with her? SEN. COONS: Well, I'm either going to meet with her in person or by phone, just another way this pandemic has upended the lives of millions of Americans. I'll press her on her previous statements about the Affordable Care Act. President Trump said he would only choose a nominee he was confident would overturn the Affordable Care Act. And as you know, MARGARET, that's on the Supreme Court's docket just one week after the election. It defies comprehension why President Trump would continue in his efforts to strip away from the American people pre-existing discrimination protection. There's more than 100 million Americans who have a pre-existing condition, seven million more because they've been infected in this pandemic. And I'll remind you, MARGARET, Justice Ginsburg's life's work was protecting us against gender discrimination. And before the ACA, insurance companies could and did discriminate against women just for being women by treating pregnancy as a pre-existing condition, charging women more for access to health insurance. It's amazing to me that Judge Barrett has publicly criticized the decision by Chief Justice Roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the ACA and that President Trump is making it clear a vote for Judge Barrett to be on the Supreme Court is a vote to repeal the ACA and take away health care protection from a majority of Americans during a pandemic. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. Judge Barrett introduced herself to the American public as a mother of seven, as sort of a class mom,\u00a0 SEN. COONS: Yes. MARGARET BREANNAN: --a very warm presentation in the public space. How do you fight that? SEN. COONS: Well, we don't need to fight that, I can respect the fact that she has a beautiful family, that her clerks and students say she's a very talented professor and judge, that's not what's at issue here. What's at issue is both this rushed and partisan confirmation in which President Trump has told us he's choosing someone who will overturn Roe v. Wade, he's choosing someone who will overturn the ACA, and he's choosing someone who President Trump himself says he will need to put their thumb on the scale so that he can win the next election. He's not confident he'll win it fair and square at the ballot box. He says we have to rush through this nominee so that there's nine justices and one he handpicks to, according to President Trump, support him in his reelection effort. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he said he wo- he believes it'll go to the court and be decided. I understand your points. As you know, with individual cases, judges sometimes are hard to predict, even though you can kind of guess where they stand ideologically. But on the question for her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett has been before your committee before because she- she was confirmed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. And at the time, Senator Feinstein said to her, and, you know what I'm going to say to you, because it's gone viral, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is of concern.\" To many people that sounded like anti Catholic bigotry. You are a man of faith. How did that comment land with you? SEN. COONS: Well, MARGARET, as you know, millions of Americans rely on our faith to guide us, to give us a framework in which we raise our children and live our lives, a community of meaning and of depth and religious faith should not be at issue here. There isn't a religious test for service in the government, whether it's in the Senate or on the Supreme Court. And if Judge Barrett is confirmed I know that justice-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Should it- is that a legitimate question? Should that be raised as a factor? SEN. COONS: What should be raised is her opinions, her speeches, her public statements as a professor and a judge, and whether or not she will uphold precedent, as you well know, MARGARET, Roe v. Wade, Griswold v. Connecticut, these are settled cases that for decades have allowed Americans to have confidence about the role of the state in terms of their private decisions about health care. And the Affordable Care Act is settled law. The Supreme Court has upheld it as being constitutional. That's on the docket a week after this election. That's on the ballot, and that's something Judge Barrett has spoken directly about. It is appropriate for us to question her statements, her opinions, her actions as a professor and judge, but not to go into questions of doctrine or faith personally. That's where I'll be focusing my questions on the Affordable Care Act and on what she has said publicly about her views on its constitutionality. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, first, presidential debate is this week. You support Joe Biden. What should we expect? Is this going to be the main argument? SEN. COONS: You should expect that President Trump, who is a very successful reality TV star, is a master of spectacle. He will say whatever it takes in order to distract us from Joe Biden, who will again show us his heart, his compassion, his character. Joe Biden has laid out a clear and strong plan for how to get us out of this pandemic, for how to bring us back together, for how to revive our economy. Joe's going to focus on that, and Donald Trump's going to try and distract us however he can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you. We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

In a statement Monday, Georgia Secretary of State spokesperson Walter Jones said the state \"is seeing record turnout for early voting because of excitement and enthusiasm of the upcoming election.\" The statement went on to say that \"long lines are to be expected\" and that \"voters need to be aware of all of their options including three weeks of early voting, no excuse absentee and in person voting day of the election.\" Mitchell\u00a0notes that the Secretary of State's office also said long lines are inevitable in part due to the amount of voters that began to gather at some early voting sites before the offices opened. Still, voters like Latreana Johnson, who lives in Garden City, Georgia, said she doesn't think the long lines will turn voters away. \"Enough is enough. People are tired...this is a life or death situation and that's how everyone should view it, especially people of minority,\" said Johnson, who added that she normally votes early. \"Don't let a long line stop you. You come and you bring your chair...you can bring whatever you want in there to assist you in voting to make sure that you vote for the right people.\" Christopher Stephens Sr. who also waited in lines on Monday told CBS News, \"Under the current administration, I think we have the strongest economy, we've had...in my lifetime. I've seen a lot of good for everybody with the way the economy is going.\" Stephens, 44, added that he does recognize the impact that the pandemic has had on the economy. \"I think Trump's done a fine job. I'm more worried about the economy being our first priority.\" CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0notes that more early in-person voting starts Tuesday in Kentucky and Texas. President Trump is back on the campaign trail Monday with a rally in Sanford, Florida, as the campaign launches a multimillion-dollar ad blitz to win the senior vote. On a call with reporters, senior adviser Jason Miller said the campaign is out with an eight-figure ad buy. The ads are airing nationally in all 50 states, including a number on Evangelical and conservative radio networks as well as other niche stations that reach Black and Hispanic voters. Miller said the campaign is also focusing on targeted local ads in 10 battleground states, including Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia. The Trump campaign is also adding more funds for ads in Michigan and Nevada. The president's trip to Florida comes as his physician revealed just hours before the event that Mr. Trump had consecutively tested negative for COVID-19. In Ohio, where Vice President Mike Pence campaigned Monday, and in Iowa, where Mr. Trump is set to visit later this week, the campaign is not airing any local ads, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Miller said it is because they feel good about winning the two states and don't want to waste money. A senior campaign aide told\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0the campaign is beginning to make some national ad buys because they find it's cheaper to reach certain battleground state voters that way. And as the campaign tries to shore up support among seniors, they are looking to advertise at times of the day that are cheaper - like daytime - than it is to reach younger voters, who mostly watch during expensive time slots. The campaign also believes their numbers among Black and Latino voters are holding steady and will target those communities with ads that knock Joe Biden. The Trump campaign spent much of Monday criticizing Biden on the Supreme Court and his unwillingness to answer whether he would pack the court with more judges or not. Campaign manager Bill Stepien, who tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago and is back at headquarters on Monday, claimed Biden is avoiding the question because his position is \"out of step\" with the American people. Pence said Democrats are intent on packing the court and said it \"would be nothing less than the biggest power grab in American history.\" Pence said Biden and running mate Senator Kamala Harris need to provide a straight answer and \"come clean with the American people.\" Meanwhile in Florida, hundreds of supporters lined up in anticipation of Mr. Trump's return to the campaign trail tonight. David Costello, a retired ICU nurse, told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0his \"deep concern\" for the president's COVID-19 diagnosis did not last long. \"He recovered. And I said, take that, COVID. Because I guess you messed with the wrong president.\" Costello, who called Mr. Trump \"immune\" from the virus, said he did not fault the commander-in-chief for receiving \"top notch\" care. The Birmingham, Alabama, resident has been waiting in a crowded line - with no mask - since 8 a.m., but said he felt \"totally comfortable.\" Costello said, \"First of all the coronavirus has a very low fatality rate.\" He added, \"Second of all, the contagious rate is dropping in this country.\" The observed case-fatality rate for coronavirus is 2.8% in the United States, but America also ranks sixth worldwide in deaths per population (65.64 per 100,000.) \"COVID is not the issue. The economy is the issue,\" said Martha Courier, a 68-year-old retired nurse from Orlando, Florida. \"So get off the fricken' COVID. Start talking about things that matter to us, like taxes.\" Asked if she felt vulnerable given her age group, Courier - who wore a mask slung below her chin - added, \"You've got to take care of yourself. You've got to stay healthy. I'm 68. I've got health issues. But I keep myself healthy.\" Bill Cerelli from Tampa returned Monday after the president canceled his last Florida rally due to his diagnosis. Asked about the White House's COVID-19 protocols and large gatherings, he shrugged. \"Seems like everyone was tested. It's an invisible plague. I'm not sure how much more you can do.\" Probed on whether or not the president should wear a mask, he added, \"I don't know how much masks help to be honest with you.\" Melissa Osborne from Orlando, Florida told CBS News, \"Do you see me wearing a mask? No way.\" Osborne said, \"I have faith in God. We're outdoors.\" She gestured to the crowds around her. \"There's a breeze.\" Nearby, former registered nurse Debbie decried mask-wearing. \"For Joe Biden to come out and say he's going to mandate masks, I'm asthmatic. You put me in a mask, I'm not going to be able to breathe.\" Biden made his second trip to Ohio in two weeks on Monday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The former vice president gave remarks with United Auto Workers Local 14 in Toledo, Ohio, hitting that media market and a media market in Michigan. Biden pitched an economic message to Ohio voters as many Americans are facing economic hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The times are hard,\" Biden declared. \"Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic and the terrible way in which it's been handled. The economic outlook remains uncertain. Across Ohio and the country, folks are worrying about making the next mortgage payment or the rent payment, whether or not they can purchase prescription drugs or put food on the table.\" Biden reiterated a frequent campaign line to draw a contrast with Trump on economic messaging. \"I view this campaign, as I've said before and I'll say it again, between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Toledo and Park Avenue.\" Biden also attended a voter mobilization event in Cincinnati, where there is a close congressional race that Democrats hope to flip. Biden's trip to the Buckeye state comes as a\u00a0recent CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll shows the race tied between Biden and Trump among Ohio likely voters. While the poll showed that the race is tied among likely voters, the poll also highlighted that a majority of Ohioans believe the president will do a better job handling economic issues, including protecting manufacturing jobs. Harris took time off the campaign trail Monday and delivered a stinging rebuke to her Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the first day of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. \"This committee has ignored commonsense requests to keep people safe - including not requiring testing for all members - despite a coronavirus outbreak among senators of this very committee,\" Harris said. \"By contrast, in response to this recent Senate outbreak, the leaders of Senate Republicans rightly postponed business on the Senate floor this week to protect the health and safety of senators and staff. Mr. Chairman, for the same reasons, this hearing should have been postponed.\" Harris joined her Democratic members saying that the future of the Affordable Care Act is on the line with Barrett's nomination. \"Republicans finally realized the Affordable Care Act is too popular to repeal in Congress, so now they are trying to bypass the will of voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work,\" Harris said. The CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0published Sunday\u00a0is the latest poll to show Biden leading Mr. Trump by more than 5 points in Nevada, more than double Hillary Clinton's margin of victory there in 2016. But campaigning in southern Nevada this weekend, the Trump campaign urged supporters not to be discouraged by what they dismissed as \"fake polls,\" reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"They're trying to get inside your heads because that's what propaganda is,\" Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union,\u00a0said at a stop\u00a0for the \"Team Trump on Tour\" bus outside the campaign's Summerlin office. Few parts of the country have been hit harder by the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic than Clark County, where casinos shuttered entirely as cases spiked earlier this year. The metropolitan area last posted the nation's\u00a0fifth worst unemployment rate\u00a0of anywhere in the country. And no issue ranks higher for likely voters in Nevada, with 83% citing the economy as a major factor in their vote to the CBS News Battleground Tracker. Trump campaign surrogates here have repeatedly denounced the state's Democratic governor for the shutdowns. Democrats have blamed Mr. Trump for worsening the pandemic and blocking needed aid from Congress. Blame for the outbreak that triggered the collapse, and views of an economic recovery under the Trump or potential Biden administrations, break down in the survey largely along party lines in Nevada. There is little doubt this year that Clark County, the majority-minority community that spans the Las Vegas Strip and makes up nearly three-fourths of Nevada's population, will continue its decades-long record of backing Democratic presidential candidates.\u00a0As of September, Democrats made up 40.9% of registered voters in southern Nevada, compared to just 28.5% Republicans. But Republicans insist a path to victory remains for the president in Nevada, relying in large part on turning out his supporters throughout Clark County from the wealthier master-planned or retirement communities that encompass much of the Las Vegas suburbs, like in Summerlin, to the more rural outposts of Clark County like Boulder City, which garnered a recent visit\u00a0by Pence. Democrats have admitted they faced some challenges of their own reaching their largely working-class, non-White base here amid the pandemic. The Biden campaign says it has devoted significant resources to voter contacts among their supporters, from pouring money into Spanish-language advertising and canvassing to phone banking targeted at Tagalog speakers among the area's booming Filipino-American community. More Than A Vote, a voting rights organization organized by professional athletes, including NBA superstar LeBron James, released a new video encouraging Americans to make a plan to vote and to cast their vote early.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the video features Major League Soccer players and was done in collaboration with Black Players for Change, which is an organization of more than 170 professional soccer players, coaches and staff dedicated to eradicating racial inequality. The soccer players cited the COVID-19 pandemic, social injustices in society and climate change as reasons to urge Americans to register to vote. \"By changing the culture around civic engagement and really taking ownership of our ability to influence the electoral process, we can begin to build a society inclusive of all of our diverse backgrounds,\" said Portland Timbers forward Jeremy Ebobisse, who's also an executive board member on BPC, in a statement. \"This summer, we've taken our energy to the streets, and now it's time to be heard through our vote.\" A group of high-profile California Democrats, including Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Congressman Jimmy Gomez, are hosting a virtual fundraiser tomorrow to support Democrats in South Carolina,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0has learned. The fundraising effort by Democrats is aimed at regaining control of the state senate in South Carolina. Tickets start at $50 and go as high as $1,000 for the grassroots fundraiser. Michael Ceraso, a former New Hampshire director for Pete Buttigieg and current candidate for Claremont City Council in the Los Angeles area, is organizing the event. The speaker line-up also features New Mexico State House District 45 Democratic candidate Linda Serrato and New Hampshire Democratic State Senate candidate Rebecca Perkins Kwoka. Notable co-hosts include Los Angeles Councilman Gil Cedillo; El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero; Claremont Councilman Jed Leano; Sonal Shah, a former senior policy adviser to Pete Buttigieg; Viktoria Cornelius, a former deputy southwest finance director to Kamala Harris's presidential campaign and Nina Smith, former traveling press secretary for Pete Buttigieg. Democratic Senate candidate Jaime Harrison announced Sunday his campaign raised $53 million in the third quarter of fundraising, breaking the record for the highest single quarter fundraising haul in U.S. Senate history. Beto O'Rourke's $38 million third quarter haul in 2018 held the previous record, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. A handful of other Democratic candidates have released their numbers as well, including Theresa Greenfield in Iowa with $28.7 million, Barbara Bollier in Kansas with nearly $13.5 million, and Cal Cunningham in North Carolina with $28.3 million. Cunningham announced his fundraising haul the night before news broke about his exchanging flirtatious texts with the woman who is not his wife, and the campaign has since confirmed their authenticity. Republican challenger John James also had an impressive quarter. He raised more than $14 million this quarter, according to his campaign. James is challenging incumbent Democratic Senator Gary Peters in a race that has tightened in recent polls. The most recent\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0found Peters ahead by three points, and the\u00a0New York Times/Sienna poll\u00a0released Monday has Peters up by just 1 point.",

            "article_content": "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee this morning. While many GOP senators focused on USPS' funding, CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte says Democrats were mostly concerned about mail and ballot processing.\u00a0\u00a0DeJoy stated, \"There have been no changes made with election mail.\" He confirmed that all ballots would be handled as first class mail, ensuring expedited delivery. But DeJoy wouldn't promise that the 671 sorting machines that have been taken offline this summer will be replaced. When pressed by skeptical Democrats about recent changes that have lead to major mail delays, DeJoy often replied that such policy decisions were made before he became postmaster general, and he has since halted controversial changes.\u00a0\u00a0Democrats didn't touch on DeJoy's personal finances, even though it's been reported that he has potential stakes in Amazon. Korte says that sources inside the American Postal Workers Union were generally unhappy with DeJoy in today's hearing and accused him of being ambiguous and untruthful. Expect DeJoy's Monday testimony before the Democrat-led House Oversight Committee to be more eventful.\u00a0Meanwhile, over a half dozen Democratic attorneys general led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro filed a lawsuit against DeJoy and the U.S. Postal Service over changes they say could delay the delivery and return of mail-in ballots in the general election. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak reports the lawsuit, announced Tuesday, followed another lawsuit that 13 attorneys general filed in Washington state earlier this week over USPS operational changes.\u00a0\u00a0This latest suit, filed in Pennsylvania federal court, argues that policy changes such as prohibiting overtime and extra delivery trips made at USPS were unlawful because they weren't submitted to the Postal Regulatory Commission and made public before they were implemented. Joining Shapiro were attorneys general from California, Delaware, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Maine and the District of Columbia. They say DeJoy's policy changes violate the Constitution's Elections Clause because they could interfere with states' ability to regulate the \"times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives.\"\u00a0\u00a0They also argue that service changes that could disproportionately affect older voters' ability to return\u00a0 mail-in ballots in time to be counted violate the 26th Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to vote. The lawsuit requests that the court vacate the operational changes made at USPS in July and appoint an independent monitor to ensure the agency complies.\u00a0\u00a0FROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENThe virtual Democratic Convention brought in real cash this week as the Biden campaign announced on Friday it raised $70 million dollars throughout the week. The campaign also says that 1.1 million people signed up with the campaign by text message. And while Joe Biden was the main focus of his nomination night on Thursday, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington garnered attention as well. In New Hampshire earlier this year, Biden met Harrington at an event and they bonded over a trait they share: stuttering. Holding up his speech, Harrington noted that the day he met Biden, he showed him how he marks his speeches for easier delivery.\u00a0\u00a0In the convention room with Biden for his primetime address, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson noticed what appeared to be similar markings in Biden's TelePrompTer. You can see the pictures here. On the upcoming GOP convention, Biden's campaign along with the Democratic National Committee promised daily counter-programming and rebuttals. DNC chairman Tom Perez also dubbed the next convention: the \"chaos convention.\"\u00a0\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPCBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says the Trump administration and president's re-election bid are furiously prepping for their turn, now that the Democratic convention is over. President Trump will appear every night of next week's GOP festivities, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh confirmed Friday.\u00a0\u00a0In an interview with CBSN, Murtaugh noted, \"it's going to be a fairly unusual participation level by the president,\" adding the party's nominating convention will be \"very focused on real people.\"\u00a0\u00a0\"The Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history,\" President Trump told audiences gathering at the Council for National Policy Meeting in Arlington, Virginia, Friday. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Council for National Policy is \"a key venue where mainstream conservatives and extremists mix,\" with fringe politics often prevailing. Tamping down\u00a0 expectations for election night, the president added that he does not expect \"meaningful\" election results on the evening of November 3.\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't think you'll know two weeks later, I don't think you'll know four weeks later, and I don't know what's gonna happen,\" the president said. In a Fox News interview Thursday night, Mr. Trump vowed to equip polling locations with law enforcement officials. \"We're going to have everything. We're going to have sheriffs and we're going to have law enforcement,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to have everybody, attorney generals. But it's very hard.\"\u00a0CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLESTRADE SCHOOLS IN TEXASA major benefit of trade school is students attend in order to parachute right into the workforce. That reality has turned ironically null amid COVID-19. In May, CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte spoke to many trade school grads about the struggle to find work. This week we caught up with Thuy Carroll, a pastry chef, who was hoping to be able to wait out the virus to find work, but when vet medical bills unexpectedly mounted she had to start making money. In response, Carroll just last week started her own baking company \u2013 named after her ailing pup, and run out of her home kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0\"I've been looking for jobs at the Four Seasons and the higher-end hotels, and they're just nonexistent right now,\" she said. \"It's been a challenge. So, I was like, I'm just gonna pivot and see what happens.\"\u00a0CONVENTIONAL WISDOMPAYING IT FORWARDAhead of what was originally slated to be a full-scale Republican National Convention in Charlotte, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says the 2020 Host Committee (CLT Host 2020, Inc.) announced Friday that it would donate furniture to a local non-profit organization as part of its goal to further the Queen City's economic development.\u00a0\u00a0In partnership with Beds for Kids 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, CLT Host 2020, Inc. will donate beds, dressers, tables, chairs, and bookshelves that will serve hundreds of families in the local area. According to the 2020 Host Committee website, the not for profit organization that was responsible for hosting and funding the 2020 Republican National Convention in Charlotte, also plans to donate $3.2 million to the Charlotte region through donations to a dozen local non-profits, a $500,000 grant to businesses and vendors negatively impacted by scaled-down events due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a $2 million discretionary grant that will serve as seed funding and support for creative initiatives that could jumpstart lasting economic growth in Charlotte.\u00a0\u00a0\"I accepted the opportunity to serve as CEO of CLT Host 2020, Inc. for just this reason,\" said CLT Host 2020, Inc. CEO John Lassiter. \"As important as large-scale events can be to the hospitality and tourism industries, the value-add to the community is what most interested me.\"\u00a0ISSUES THAT MATTERABSENTEE BALLOTSThe United States Postal Service is confirming that workers cannot serve as absentee ballot witnesses while on duty, according to CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Ten states require absentee voters to get a witness signature or have their absentee ballot notarized for this upcoming election.\u00a0 This year, some states have suggested postal workers could serve as witnesses, but earlier this week, the Anchorage Daily News reported that USPS employees refused to serve as witnesses for some absentee voters during the primary.\u00a0\u00a0\"Postal Employees are prohibited from serving as witnesses in their official capacity while on duty, due in part to the potential operational impacts,\" USPS senior public relations representative Marti Johnson said in a statement Friday. \"The guidance has not changed this year. The Postal Service does not prohibit an employee from serving as a witness in their personal capacity off-duty, if they so choose.\"\u00a0\u00a0In March, the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) listed \"mail delivery persons\" as potential witnesses for absentee voters. WEC spokesperson Reid Magney told CBS that officials in Wisconsin weren't aware of the rule. \"We didn't know. We made an assumption that they could do it. Apparently this has been a policy for quite some time,\" Magney told CBS News this week.\u00a0UNEMPLOYMENTData released by the Bureau of Labor on Friday shows that battleground states Florida and North Carolina are among a list of states with \"unemployment rates significantly different\" from rates reported in July 2020. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that both states saw slight percentage increases in their state's unemployment rates in the past month.\u00a0In July, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity announced that the state's unemployment rate for June 2020 was 10.4 percent, a 3.3% drop from the revised May 2020 unemployment rate of 13.7%. The latest report shows that Florida's unemployment saw a 0.9% uptick to 11.3% in July. In North Carolina, the unemployment rate increased by 1 percentage point, from 7.5% in June to 8.5% in July. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who is also the only Democrat in statewide office in the state, said in a statement Friday that \"because Trump refused to come to the table\" and negotiate additional coronavirus relief with House Democrats, Floridians lost federal unemployment assistance and again facing eviction. \"Donald Trump's incompetent response to the coronavirus crisis has thrown millions of Floridians into economic insecurity and his continued effort to downplay and distract from the pandemic clearly continues to cost Floridians their lives and livelihoods,\" said Fried. \"Our unemployment crisis will persist until we have a leader capable of getting the job done and executing a national strategy to control the coronavirus...\"\u00a0\u00a0North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin released a statement Friday blaming the president's coronavirus response for the continued economic strain on state's workforce. \"Nearly six months into this pandemic, our workforce and small business community are still suffering because of the Trump administration's delayed, mismanaged response to the crisis,\" said Goodwin. \"His backwards priorities have made it clear that he is not capable of rising to this challenge\u2026\"\u00a0ON THE $$$CASH HAULCBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports presidential campaigns and political parties had a monthly filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission overnight, and new reports give more insight into the spending of the campaigns in July and their standing in the final months of the election season. The Trump campaign, RNC and its entities previously announced raising $165 million last month. Filings show the campaign also had $64.5 million in operating expenditures, while the RNC had $29.7 million in expenditures in July. Earlier this month, the campaign said the RNC and joint fundraising committees raised $1 billion across the entire cycle so far, but the new filings also show the entities combined have now spent more than $1 billion since the beginning of 2017.\u00a0Meanwhile, the Biden campaign had previously announced it along with the DNC and joint fundraising committee raised $140 million in July, but the new filings show the Biden campaign had $58.7 million in expenditures last month while the DNC had $8.9 million in direct operating expenses not including transfers to other committees. Neither campaign's joint fundraising committees face a filing deadline with the FEC for July numbers until later this fall. After wrapping up July, the Trump campaign and GOP entities said it had $300 million cash on hand; the Biden campaign and Democrats announced earlier this month they had $294 million cash on hand.\u00a0NEWSMAKERSKANYE WESTIt's been a bad week for Yeezy in the Midwest, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. A day after getting kicked off Wisconsin's ballot, the Illinois State Board of Elections voted unanimously this morning to not certify Kanye West as a candidate in November, due to a lack of valid signatures. After a challenge and examination in the Chicago office of the SBE, 1,928 out of the 3,128 signatures filed by West were found invalid, so he fell 1,300 signatures below the minimum 2,500 needed. The board sustained the objection, which means West will not be on the ballot in his home state of Illinois. Minutes after the decision, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose invalidated West's filing that state after information or signatures on his filings didn't match. West also fell short in West Virginia by 761 signatures. His campaign did not respond to questions about whether the decisions would be appealed. He filed in Tennessee on Thursday and in Virginia on Friday. Both states' filings are still under review, as well as Iowa and Minnesota, though West included them in a list of states where he says he will be on the ballot.\u00a0\u00a0STATE-BY-STATECALIFORNIADemocrats in California have been dreaming about the possibility of an open U.S Senate seat and with Sen. Kamala Harris on the ticket, that might happen in January. Should Joe Biden and Harris defeat President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, California Governor Gavin Newsom will appoint a replacement for Harris to serve the remaining two years of her term.\u00a0\u00a0Democratic sources in the state tell CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar that Congressman Adam Schiff, Congresswoman Katie Porter, Congresswoman Nanette Diaz Baragan, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, have all made calls to lobby constituencies for the job. Others, like Secretary of State Alex Padilla, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Representatives Karen Bass and Barbara Lee, and former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis consistently come up in conversations as likely replacements. Top strategists, staffers, and state lawmakers in California explain the pressure points Newsom will face, the factors he'll consider, and what the potential decision could mean for the state's politics.\u00a0WISCONSINRepublican legislative leaders in Wisconsin are urging the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) to add a fourth debate and believe it should be held in the Badger State, reports CBS news campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The first presidential debate between President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is scheduled for September 29 in Cleveland.\u00a0\u00a0Clerks in Wisconsin must mail absentee ballots to voters who have requested them by September 17. \"By the time the first presidential debate happens on September 29, 2020, voters in Wisconsin will have already started voting,\" Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate President Roger Roth wrote in their letter to the CPD. \"Wisconsinites who vote early deserve the same opportunity afforded to other states to hear the two competing visions for our country and make a well-informed decision when casting their vote.\"\u00a0\u00a0Biden's campaign has supported holding three debates, but earlier this month President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani requested a fourth debate be held in early September. In a letter on August 6, the CPD co-chairs denied the request. \"While more people will likely vote by mail in 2020, the debate schedule has been and will be highly publicized. Any voter who wishes to watch one or more debates before voting will be well aware of that opportunity,\" the co-chairs for the CPD wrote.\u00a0CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGEIN THE HOUSEMassachusettsIn their second debate, CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports incumbent Congressman Richie Neal and challenger Alex Morse again argued over Neal's 30-year record, as well as how to handle the economic crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Morse and progressive groups like the Justice Democrats have played up Neal's ties to special interests, trying to portray the incumbent as out of touch with the district. In response, Neal talked about being able to get federal funding for district projects, his record on Social Security and Medicare, and specifically hit Morse on saying he wouldn't support the CARES Act. Their Democratic primary for Massachusetts' 1st District is on Tuesday, September 1.\u00a0\u00a0QAnonHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Vice President Mike Pence were direct in their condemnation of the QAnon conspiracy extremist group, days after the president seemed to back the group by saying QAnon members like him and \"love our country.\"\u00a0\u00a0On Thursday, in an appearance on Fox News, McCarthy said there's \"no place\" for the group in the Republican party. He said of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia GOP candidate who has supported conspiracies associated with QAnon, that she has denounced it. \"But the real question will be, when you look to the Democratic party, to a Tlaib or Omar, to the anti-Semitic comments where the Democrats would not stand up,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0In May of 2019, the House passed a broad censure condemning \"anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry\" after comments critical of Israel were made by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Greene, who once described Tlaib's and Omar's entry into Congress part of an \"Islamic invasion,\" told the Washington Examiner on Friday that QAnon doesn't represent her campaign. \"I was willing to post it and talk about it \u2014 and sometimes believe things that maybe I thought were true at the time, and then, no, no, I don't think this is true. I'm not ashamed of that whatsoever,\" she said. According to Navarro, this comes after a week of an assortment of clips of her talking about 9/11 and Seth Rich conspiracies surfaced, both theories within the QAnon network.\u00a0\u00a0New JerseyCongressman Tom Malinowski, a freshman Democrat in New Jersey's 7th District, tweeted that constituents contacted him about a poll asking if he belonged to a \"child sex ring.\" Malinowski wrote, \"That's right - they are using a poll to push out the main QAnon conspiracy theory in our district.\" The notion of a child sex trafficking ring is one of the central theories with QAnon, and has led to one man being arrested for firing an assault rifle in a DC pizza restaurant. The National Republican Campaign Committee quote-tweeted him, and wrote, \"You lobbying to protect sexual predators isn't a conspiracy @Malinowski. It's a fact.\" This referred to a story Republicans have been pushing, about Malinowski lobbying against a sex offender registry during his time at the Human Rights Watch organization. Malinowski told Navarro he had \"no role whatsoever\" on that issue, and during his tenure he was in a completely different department, focused on foreign policy and national security. He said the HRW had to fill out a lobbying disclosure form with everything the D.C. office divisions had worked on, including an effort against a 2006 crime bill that had provisions related to expanding who would be on the national sex offender registry.\u00a0\u00a0While he was listed, Malinowski said it had \"all the people who did the advocacy on Capitol Hill, but that doesn't mean everybody on that list worked on every issue that was on the list.\"\u00a0\u00a0A former HRW colleague of Malinowski's, Jennifer Daskal, said he had no involvement on domestic issues such as the effort against the crime bill. \"Those I did independently of him, and did not consult or work with him on,\" Daskal said.",

Ocasio-Cortez defeated Republican challenger\u00a0John Cummings, a high school teacher from the Bronx. In a tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said that serving the district and \"fighting for working class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege, & responsibility of my life.\" She thanked voters in the Bronx and Queens for their support \u2014 \"despite the millions spent against us.\"\u00a0 Serving NY-14 and fighting for working class families in Congress has been the greatest honor, privilege, & responsibility of my life.Thank you to the Bronx & Queens for re-electing me to the House despite the millions spent against us, & trusting me to represent you once more. https://t.co/MXG2Z2DV2F She was first elected in 2018 and was thrust into the national spotlight\u00a0as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, taking office at the age of 29. She had been working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her first campaign, ultimately defeating 10-time incumbent Democrat Joe Crowley.\u00a0 Commonly known by her initials, AOC is a Democratic Socialist who believes in universal health care, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change through the Green New Deal. Another of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues is eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics. During the 2018 election, most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She accepted some money from labor unions, but refused to take any contributions from corporate political action committees.\u00a0 The now 31-year-old raised more than $17 million during the 2020 race, while Cummings raised nearly $10 million \u2014 making it the second most expensive House race this year, according to Open Secrets.\u00a0 During her first two years in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez often drew media attention. She and three other first-time Democratic congresswomen of color dubbed themselves \"The Squad.\"\u00a0 Fellow Squad members Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts are also projected to win their bids for reelection. To mark the occasion, Ocasio-Cortez retweeted Omar: \"Our sisterhood is resilient,\"\u00a0the tweet read. In an interview with Vanity Fair, published last week, Ocasio-Cortez talked about the speculation surrounding her future.\u00a0 \"I don't know if I'm really going to be staying in the House forever, or if I do stay in the House, what that would look like,\" she said in the interview with Michelle Ruiz. \"I don't see myself really staying where I'm at for the rest of my life.\"\u00a0 She said she doesn't want to aspire to a \"higher position\" just for the sake of the title. \"I truly make an assessment to see if I can be more effective,\" she said. \"And so, you know, I don't know if I could necessarily be more effective in an administration, but, for me that's always what the question comes down to.\"\u00a0 Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

            "article_content": "Jamaal Bowman isn't claiming victory just yet in his high-profile challenge of Congressman Eliot Engel, a 31-year-incumbent and chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but Bowman has a strong early lead.\u00a0 He was ahead of Engel by 20 points late Tuesday night, though over half the precincts remained to be counted. In any case, his strong showing in New York's 16th District is an encouraging sign for progressive Democrats, who helped recruit for and supported Bowman's campaign in the months leading up to the primary.\u00a0 \"Eliot Engel used to say he was a thorn in the side of Donald Trump, but you know what Donald Trump is more afraid of than anyone, anything else? A black man with power,\" Bowman said in his primary night speech.\u00a0 \"If the results continue to bear out, and we get to Congress, it will be our job to hold Donald Trump accountable and to hold every politician accountable that continues to be beholden to corporate interests ... and is not fighting for the poor and the working class in our country.\" Bowman campaign officials said they were surprised he's leading in precincts where Engel was expected to have strong support. Engel's campaign said it didn't expect the race to be decided Tuesday night because there are \"way too many absentee votes outstanding.\" State law mandates any submitted absentee ballots in New York will begin to be counted eight days after Election Day. Ballots received by June 30 will also be counted, as long as they were postmarked by June 23.\u00a0 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, absentee ballot applications were sent to every registered voter. That could benefit incumbents with support in wealthier areas like parts of Manhattan,\u00a0since a significant number of people from those areas left their homes\u00a0early in the outbreak.\u00a0 At least 1,857,638 absentee ballots were sent out in the state this year, a vast increase over the approximately 115,000 that were cast in the 2016 presidential primaries. More than 708,000 absentee ballot requests came from New York City, according to the city's Board of Elections. Almost 100,000 Democratic absentee ballots were sent out by the Westchester County Board of Elections, with at least 86,836 sent out in the Bronx. The 16th district encompasses parts of Westchester and north Bronx.\u00a0 Bowman's campaign mirrors Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 run against Congressman Joe Crowley, a progressive campaign that painted the incumbent as absent and an awkward fit with the New York City district.\u00a0 \"This is that moment for all of us, and the results show that this district is demanding change. This is what this district has been waiting for, this is what this country has been waiting for,\" Bowman added. A former Bronx school principal, Bowman was boosted in the months leading up to the election by a combination of gaffes by Engel and a slate of endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. It didn't help Engel that in May,\u00a0an Atlantic reporter\u00a0caught him in a lie about being in his district for a coronavirus-related event. Weeks later, during a Bronx news conference about recent protests over police brutality Engel was caught on an open microphone asking to be allowed to address the crowd, saying, \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care.\" In New York's 12th District, challenger Suraj Patel is in a close race with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who chairs the House Oversight Committee. She beat Patel by almost 20 points in 2018. But early results show Patel leading in the Queens and Brooklyn parts of the district, and trailing Maloney slightly in Manhattan. In an election night statement, Patel said, \"We are confident in our path to victory after a very strong performance on Election Day, which traditionally favors establishment voters. Over 58% of New Yorkers have rejected the incumbent's politics of the past. We have a mandate for change, and the final tally will reflect that.\" City Councilman Ritchie Torres is handily winning in an open seat in New York's 15th District. He's leading Ruben Diaz Sr.,\u00a0a controversial pastor\u00a0who has supported Republicans and invited President Trump to his church.\u00a0 In the 17th District, lawyer Mondaire Jones is leading the race for Congresswoman Nita Lowey's former seat.\u00a0 In New York's 14th District, Ocasio-Cortez cruised by in her primary challenge from former journalist Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who spent $1 million on her own campaign and was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. New York City saw several problems with polling locations on Tuesday, with\u00a0many voters going on social media\u00a0criticizing delayed openings and the distribution of incorrect ballot sets. About 30,000 voters also didn't receive their absentee ballots in time, forcing them to vote in person early or on primary day.\u00a0 Perry Grossman, a voting rights lawyer for the New York ACLU, said that while the Board of Elections had to deal with an unprecedented number of absentee ballots, Tuesday showed \"some major, major faults.\" \"This is a massive stress test for elections nationally and probably New York in particular. And there are real faults in the system that we have to address,\" he said. Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Las Vegas \u2014 On Valentine's Day, while many of the guests at the ritzy Bellagio were lost in their romantic thoughts, Joe Biden had courtship of a different kind in mind. He went straight to the back of the hotel to its service hallways to greet hundreds of workers serving the Valentine's Day vacationers. Leaving the traveling press corps behind, Biden asked the workers about their jobs and families but did not ask for their vote, as he usually does on the campaign trail, according to two aides who were with him. Still, it's their support he'll need in the short term. In the wake of disappointing finishes out of the top three in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden and his team are counting on the service unions here to keep him in the race for the White House.\u00a0 But union membership has dwindled by half over the last two decades, representing around 10% of the American workforce. Biden promises a union revival if elected. Labor's presence at his events has provided a bedrock of support for Biden. Five national unions have already endorsed him, the most of any Democratic presidential candidate, along with several local and state unions. His campaign is hoping to highlight his appeal to unions at the forefront of his campaign, especially this week in Nevada where almost 15% of employees are union members, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Although a senior Biden source called it a \"letdown\" to hear the powerful Culinary Union representing tens of thousands of service workers on the Las Vegas strip announce it would not be endorsing a candidate, Biden did receive a consolation prize when the head of the union, Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline, told reporters that the former vice president is a \"friend\" of the union. \u00a0 Perhaps more valuable to Biden, though, is that the Culinary Union has made no secret of its rejection of the \"Medicare for All\" health plan championed by front-runner Bernie Sanders and by Elizabeth Warren. It's a proposal that would do away with the union's generous private health care plan, which, Arg\u00fcello-Kline pointed out, was the reason its members \"went on strike for 6 years, 4 months, and 10 days to protect.\" The union gave its members a scorecard of the candidates pointing out the moderates like Biden, who would \"Protect Culinary Healthcare,\" versus Sanders, who would \"End Culinary Healthcare.\"\u00a0 While two senior Biden campaign sources told CBS News they would consider beating Sanders in Nevada an upset, they think that if Biden performs well in Nevada, strong union support could be key to keeping the campaign competitive in future states. In 2016 labor supported Hillary Clinton with more national union endorsements than Sanders, and union voters ultimately voted for her 2 to 1, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. But even in union-friendly states, the value of union endorsements is debatable. While a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicates a union member is only 4% more likely to vote than a non-union member with similar traits, other research indicates that union endorsements may have a larger effect on voters who would otherwise be less inclined to vote. \"The effect of unions tends to be larger for workers who might not otherwise participate in politics,\" Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who studies American unions, told CBS News, \"Unions are offering their members information about who is on the ballot\u2026and practically helping members register to vote and turn out on Election Day.\" After Nevada, though, many of the subsequent nominating contests will be taking place in states with lower union membership or \"right-to-work\" laws that prohibit unions from forcing employees' participation and mandating dues of their workers, a move that Democrats see as significantly weakening union bargaining power. South Carolina, a right-to-work state, and the location of the next nominating contest Biden has targeted for the resurgence of his campaign, has the lowest rate of unionized workers in the entire country with just 2.2%, according to BLS. He is still polling well there, but his lead has narrowed. Eight of the 16 states and territories voting four days after South Carolina on Super Tuesday are right-to-work states where both unions and individual unions members on average are less likely to be politically engaged, according to a 2018 NBER study. In Vegas, Biden is speaking the language of the unions. At one event last weekend, the workers who helped construct the Las Vegas strip vigorously cheered Biden's demand that federal projects be built with \"Davis-Bacon money,\" a reference to union prevailing wage laws. Louis Loupias, a heavy-equipment apprentice coordinator for the Operating Engineers union in Las Vegas, told CBS News he appreciated Biden's response to the Trump Administration's Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program (IRAP) which encourages more business participation with apprenticeship programs, rather than long established and government-registered apprenticeship programs. On Tuesday, Loupias estimated almost half of his local union had already voted in the new Nevada early caucus process and added Biden's forum presence ensured him he is someone he could confidently support if he is the nominee. But Loupias said he voted early for Tom Steyer because he admires how he built his billion-dollar company and created jobs. Not all unions oppose Sanders here, either. Vote Nurses Values PAC, the political arm of National Nurses United, is running radio ads encouraging Nevadans to caucus for Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u00a0 Biden's first union endorsement came from the 313,000-member International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), which says it plans to keep working for him. His affection for the firefighters extends beyond their attendance at his event in their gold-and-black \"Fire Fighters for Biden\" T-shirts. He treats them like rock stars, informing crowds that \"God made man\u2026and then he made a few fire fighters.\" IAFF members served as caucus precinct chairs for Biden in Iowa and now has a team in Nevada ready to assist. Its members have injected hundreds of thousands of dollars in his campaign, as well as at least $100,000 into the super PAC supporting him.\u00a0 The 100,000-member National Association of Government Employees representing public and private sector workers, has also thrown its support to Biden, as has the more than 200,000-member Amalgamated Transit Union, and the 130,000-member Iron Workers union, whose presence has been felt in Nevada this week, where \"Iron Workers for Biden\" t-shirts and signs can be seen at his events. \"Many of the elders of the party I believe chose to ignore our value as they were looking at identity politics, new coalitions, the new energy and were willing to\u2026push aside hard-working, middle-class union members,\" IAFF general president Schaitberger said. \"We feel like we are sometimes looked at like a bunch of meatballs with meaty hands and are grimy at the end of the work day\u2026but [Biden] grew up in that environment and the overwhelming part of his life did not focus on wealth.\" On the stump Biden is \"Middle-class Joe\" and reminisces about how it unions \"built America\" and the middle class \u2014 not Wall Street. Where he came from, he often says, you either became a cop, fire fighter, tradesman or a priest. Acknowledging that his 50-year career around Pennsylvania Avenue is a world away from his blue-collar origins in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he shrugs and adds, \"But I wasn't qualified to be any of them.\" Angela Perez contributed to this report.\u00a0 Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "A campaign that started more than two years ago and featured more than 2,200 candidate events is down to its final weekend in Iowa. On Monday night, Iowa will officially kick off the presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses.\u00a0 There has been a clear top tier of Democratic hopefuls in Iowa since the early fall: former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Two of those candidates, Sanders and Warren, have been stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial the past two weeks, while Biden and Buttigieg have been able to camp out in the state. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has also been in Washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months.\u00a0 All the major candidates are blanketing the state this weekend and making their closing arguments to fire up supporters and try to win over some of the voters still trying to make up their minds.\u00a0 Sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in January. While he has been one of the candidates stuck in Washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Sanders' wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. The Vermont senator has spent some of his final days in Iowa stressing that his \"political revolution\" can begin here. \"The entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back,\" Sanders said in Storm Lake on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte. He has also emphasized that the Democratic \"establishment\" is worried about the strength of his movement.\u00a0 \"We are their worst nightmare! This is their 'Nightmare on Elm Street,'\" Sanders said in Sioux City on Sunday, Korte reports. \u00a0 If Sanders is successful on Monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class Americans. The campaign also has an aggressive ground game in Iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. Although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with Latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come Caucus Night.\u00a0 Biden has spent months making the case to Iowans, in person and in advertisements, that he's best suited to take on President Trump in a general election and \"restore the soul of the nation.\" In the days leading up to the caucuses, advertisements have emphasized Biden's poll numbers against Trump and stressed that \"this is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate.\" Biden has repeatedly said the values that uphold American democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them. \"Character is on the ballot,\" Biden said in Waukee on Thursday in a speech aimed at President Trump, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. \"Does it matter if a president lies? Does it matter if a president has no moral compass? Does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? Does it matter if a president is petty? Mean? Cruel? Spiteful? Does the character of a president matter? I believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes.\" Biden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from Republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son Hunter to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\u00a0 \"They have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far,\" Biden said in Iowa City on Monday. \"And I'm just gonna say it...I'm still standing and just getting stronger.\" Biden also ramped up his visits to Iowa in December and January while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities. If Biden is successful on Monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump. While many important issues come up in conversations with Iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. The Biden campaign hopes those Iowans will turn out for the former vice president.\u00a0 Buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including \"future former Republicans.\" Buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam Iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for President Obama before switching to Mr. Trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in Iowa's pivot counties.\u00a0 The Midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside Washington for Democrats to win in November. He also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. And in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg began to draw finer distinctions between himself and some of his top rivals.\u00a0 \"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\" Buttigieg said Decorah on Thursday, according to CBS News Reporter Jack Turman. \"But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\" At another stop, Turman reports, Buttigieg again went after Biden and Sanders. He framed Sanders' vision as a \"revolution\" where \"nothing counts unless you go all the way.\" Buttigieg took on two of Sanders' signature policy proposals: \"Medicare for All,\" the ambitious and expensive plan for the government to provide health care to all Americans, and free public college. If Buttigieg is successful on Monday night, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. The campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many Iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. He also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state.\u00a0 Warren, who has also been tied up with the impeachment trial, has sent a flood of surrogates to the state, including former Democratic rival Julian Casto. She built up an early operation in Iowa, but has seen poll numbers dip since the fall. At events in Iowa last weekend, Warren addressed the electability argument head on and stressed that she believes Democrats need to nominate a woman to beat Mr. Trump. \"We now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since Donald Trump was elected,\" Warren said in Davenport on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 Warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she is a \"fighter\" who can defeat Mr. Trump and deliver progressive victories in Washington.\u00a0 \"We have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back,\" Warren said on Saturday in Muscatine. \"Me, I'm fighting back. That's why I'm in this.\" If Warren is successful on Caucus Night, it will be partly due to her organizing strength in the state. Her team built a large operation early in the process and deployed organizers around the state before many campaigns built out their Iowa infrastructure. Her broad range of policy proposals have resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views.\u00a0 Klobuchar has pitched herself as a candidate with a strong electoral record and Midwestern roots. At nearly every event she has told people that she has won \"every race, every place, every time\" and talks about the \"surge\" she sees in Iowa in polls and her endorsements. She has emphasized that she believes the election is a quote \"decency check\" on Mr. Trump and in order to send a strong message, Democrats need to \"win big.\" \"Last thing that I will say is just that we want to win,\" Klobuchar said in Waterloo on Sunday. \"And my profound advice to you is we'd better not screw this up. And we better put someone at the top of the ticket, and this is my piece for me, someone at the top of the ticket that has the record of bringing people with her and winning big.\" While she's been in Washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. Klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. And she's told undecided Iowans to call friends and family in Minnesota for a performance review.\u00a0 If Klobuchar is successful on Monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. She has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of Iowa's 99 counties.\u00a0 Some of the lower-polling candidates, such as Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Senator Michael Bennet, turned their attention to New Hampshire months ago. But entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are both holding out hope for strong finishes in Iowa. \u00a0 Yang is approaching the end of a of a 17-day swing across Iowa. Yang has been campaigning on a message that a changing economy requires a different perspective in Washington to ensure Americans aren't left behind. He's promised that a win in Iowa will also mean a victory in New Hampshire.\u00a0 Steyer, meanwhile, has presented himself as the \"unconventional\" politician who can go head-to-head with President Trump on the economy. Steyer also points to his work building grassroots coalitions and reminds Iowans at nearly every town hall that he's the only candidate who will make tackling climate change his number one priority.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has also been in Washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months.\u00a0 All the major candidates are blanketing the state this weekend and making their closing arguments to fire up supporters and try to win over some of the voters still trying to make up their minds.\u00a0 Read more here. BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in January. While he has been one of the candidates stuck in Washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Sanders' wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. The Vermont senator has spent some of his final days in Iowa stressing that his \"political revolution\" can begin here.\u00a0 \"The entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back,\" Sanders said in Storm Lake on Sunday, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte. He has also emphasized that the Democratic \"establishment\" is worried about the strength of his movement.\u00a0 \"We are their worst nightmare! This is their 'Nightmare on Elm Street,'\" Sanders said in Sioux City on Sunday, Korte reports. \u00a0 If Sanders is successful on Monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class Americans. The campaign also has an aggressive ground game in Iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. Although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with Latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come Caucus Night.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Joe Biden has spent months making the case to Iowans, in person and in advertisements, that he's best suited to take on President Trump in a general election and \"restore the soul of the nation.\" In the days leading up to the caucuses, advertisements have emphasized Biden's poll numbers against Trump and stressed that \"this is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate.\"\u00a0 Biden has repeatedly said the values that uphold American democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them.\u00a0 \"Character is on the ballot,\" Biden said in Waukee on Thursday in a speech aimed at President Trump, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. \"Does it matter if a president lies? Does it matter if a president has no moral compass? Does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? Does it matter if a president is petty? Mean? Cruel? Spiteful? Does the character of a president matter? I believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes.\"\u00a0 Biden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from Republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son Hunter to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\u00a0 \"They have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far,\" Biden said in Iowa City on Monday. \"And I'm just gonna say it...I'm still standing and just getting stronger.\" Biden also ramped up his visits to Iowa in December and January while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities. If Biden is successful on Monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump. While many important issues come up in conversations with Iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. The Biden campaign hopes those Iowans will turn out for the former vice president.\u00a0 PETE BUTTIGIEG Pete Buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including \"future former Republicans.\" Buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam Iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for President Obama before switching to Mr. Trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in Iowa's pivot counties.\u00a0 The Midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside Washington for Democrats to win in November. He also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. And in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg began to\u00a0draw finer distinctions\u00a0between himself and some of his top rivals. \u00a0 \"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\" Buttigieg said in Decorah on Thursday, according to\u00a0CBS News Reporter Jack Turman. \"But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\"\u00a0 At another stop, Turman reports, Buttigieg again went after Biden and Sanders. He framed Sanders' vision as a \"revolution\" where \"nothing counts unless you go all the way.\" Buttigieg took on two of Sanders' signature policy proposals: \"Medicare for All,\" the ambitious and expensive plan for the government to provide health care to all Americans, and free public college. If Buttigieg prevails on Monday, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. The campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many Iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. He also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren, who has also been tied up with the impeachment trial, has sent a flood of surrogates to the state, including former Democratic rival Julian Castro. She built up an early operation in Iowa, but has seen poll numbers dip since the fall. At events in Iowa last weekend, Warren addressed the electability argument head on and stressed that she believes Democrats need to nominate a woman to beat Mr. Trump.\u00a0 \"We now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since Donald Trump was elected,\" Warren said in Davenport on Sunday, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. Warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she's a \"fighter\" who can defeat Mr. Trump and deliver progressive victories in Washington.\u00a0 \"We have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back,\" Warren said on Saturday in Muscatine. \"Me, I'm fighting back. That's why I'm in this.\" If Warren is successful on Caucus Night, it will be partly due to her organizing strength in the state. Her team built a large operation early in the process and deployed organizers around the state before many campaigns built out their Iowa infrastructure. Her broad range of policy proposals has resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR Amy Klobuchar has pitched herself as a candidate with a strong electoral record and Midwestern roots. At nearly every event she has told people that she has won \"every race, every place, every time\" and talks about the \"surge\" she sees in Iowa in polls and her endorsements.\u00a0 She has emphasized that she believes the election is a \"decency check\" on Mr. Trump and in order to send a strong message, Democrats need to \"win big.\" \"Last thing that I will say is just that we want to win,\" Klobuchar said in Waterloo on Sunday. \"And my profound advice to you is we'd better not screw this up. And we better put someone at the top of the ticket, and this is my piece for me, someone at the top of the ticket that has the record of bringing people with her and winning big.\"\u00a0 While she's been in Washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. Klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. And she's told undecided Iowans to call friends and family in Minnesota for a performance review.\u00a0 If Klobuchar is successful on Monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. She has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of Iowa's 99 counties.\u00a0 ANDREW YANG Andrew Yang is approaching the end of a of a 17-day swing across Iowa. Yang has been campaigning on a message that a changing economy requires a different perspective in Washington to ensure Americans aren't left behind. He's promised that a win in Iowa will also mean a victory in New Hampshire.\u00a0 TOM STEYER Tom Steyer has presented himself as the \"unconventional\" politician who can go head-to-head with President Trump on the economy. Steyer also points to his work building grassroots coalitions and reminds Iowans at nearly every town hall that he's the only candidate who will make tackling climate change his number one priority. UP FOR DEBATE The Democratic National Committee is switching the qualifications for candidates to participate in the Nevada Democratic presidential primary debate, including eliminating the unique donor threshold, which paves the way for Mike Bloomberg to potentially qualify for future presidential debates.\u00a0 To make the debate stage in Las Vegas on February 19,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says candidates need to meet either a new polling threshold or received pledged delegates. Presidential hopefuls must receive either 10% in four state or national polls or 12% in two state polls out of either Nevada or South Carolina from a list released by the DNC. Those polls must be released between February 15 and 11:59 p.m. ET on February 18.\u00a0 Alternatively, candidates can qualify based on pledged delegates. Those delegates will be awarded based on the results of the Iowa caucuses on February 3 as calculated and reported by the Iowa Democratic Party or the New Hampshire primary on February 11 as calculated and reported by the Associated Press.\u00a0 Based on a CBS News analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All candidates have until February 18 to qualify.\u00a0 For the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to help candidates qualify for the debate. This could benefit billionaire Mike Bloomberg who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. The requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past. He has not yet reached the polling threshold but has ticked up in support in polls released in recent weeks.\u00a0 \"We are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together,\" Bloomberg's campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. \"Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.\"\u00a0 Other campaigns including Sanders' and Steyers' have slammed the decision to remove a donor qualification, calling it \"wrong.\" Read more here. BIDEN TAKES NOTE OF TIMING IN BOLTON MANUSCRIPT Former national security adviser John Bolton's book manuscript has piqued the interest of Joe Biden, who mentioned it today at a campaign stop in Fort Madison, Iowa, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson noted. It's the timing that caught his attention. According to a\u00a0New York Times report, \"in early May\" last year, President Trump told Bolton to call the Ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had just won the presidency, in order to ensure that he'd meet with the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.\u00a0 Just about an hour and twenty minutes before the Senate\u00a0voted not to call witnesses, including Bolton, Biden told the crowd that he was in the race \"in May,\" and according to the transcript, the president \"instructed Bolton to go to the Ukrainians and try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.\" (h/t CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro). The former vice president was likely referring to the fact that it's Giuliani who has been alleging and investigating, on Mr. Trump's behalf, corruption allegations of Joe and Hunter Biden related to Ukraine. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either Biden has surfaced. Earlier this week, the Times reported that Bolton had written in his book draft that the president had told him in August that he wanted to continue the pause in military aid to Ukraine until officials helped with investigations into Democrats including Biden.\u00a0 Biden declared he was running for president on April 25, days before the meeting described by Bolton.\u00a0 NEVADA Cory Booker's former supporters are picking new favorites in Nevada this week, among the new endorsements rolled out Friday by the Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden campaigns. Included are two women of color in the state: state Assemblywoman Selena Torres, now backing\u00a0Biden, and Reno-Sparks NAACP President Patricia Gallimore, now behind\u00a0Warren.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says a quarter of the Nevada's Democratic electorate is estimated to be women of color, with 22% of likely caucus-goers in the demographic still undecided in a recent poll by advocacy group She the People in the state.\u00a0Biden and Bernie Sanders\u00a0virtually tied for the lead in the survey, with only Warren (10%) and Tom Steyer (14%) also clearing double digits. SPENDING SPREE Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg filed his fourth-quarter FEC report.\u00a0 Although he was late entering the Democratic field, launching at the end of November, his campaign spent nearly $188 million, including over $140 million dollars on television and digital advertising says\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.\u00a0 \"Our first month's filing represents a down payment and commitment in all 50 states to defeat Donald Trump, and it shows we have the resources and plan necessary to take him on,\" Bloomberg 2020 Campaign Manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement released by the campaign. Other expenses include $14 million in payments to his private company Bloomberg LP.\u00a0 A campaign aide tells CBS News that these expenses include air travel, as Mayor Bloomberg travels on a plane owned by Bloomberg LP and it also includes personnel costs, for employees who switched over to Bloomberg's presidential campaign. Hawkfish LLC, a tech start-up launched by Bloomberg also received $12 million for its advertising work for the campaign. The campaign also disclosed $679,000 in spending for some campaign staffers living in New York City, the location of the campaign headquarters. Housing and furniture were offered to some staffers who relocated to the city, regardless of seniority.\u00a0 The campaign listed the merchandise it sold as \"other receipts,\" saying that the products were \"union-made in the USA,\" and priced at cost.",

            "article_content": "This is the latest installment of CBSN's America's Right to Vote series, which examines voting rights and access through the 2020 campaign. Michigan. Wisconsin. Pennsylvania. These three states won the presidential race in 2016 for Donald Trump. And Democrats have been on a mission to win them back, but there's some disagreement about the best way to do that.\u00a0 Some local leaders contend the party is approaching these Midwestern and Rust Belt states the wrong way, focusing too much on the White working class voters who backed Mr. Trump and not enough on voters who didn't turn out at all.\u00a0 \"Part of the Achilles heel of the Democratic campaign strategy in the Midwest, and my opinion, has been the over emphasis on independents,\" says Reverend Charles Williams, pastor of King Solomon Baptist Church in Detroit and president of the Michigan Chapter of National Action Network. \"At some point, you have to say the folks who you want to come out for you that came out in 2008 and 2012, from Barack Obama, overwhelmingly, you have to talk to them.\" President Trump won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 voters in 2016. Turnout among African American voters in Wayne County, which include Detroit, decreased by over 35,000 voters. Mr. Trump won Wisconsin by about 23,000 votes, and turnout among Black voters in Milwaukee County was down by about 52,000 votes.\u00a0 But trying to reach the turnout levels of 2008 and 2012 in places like Wayne County could be unrealistic. Yes, Hillary Clinton's rate of support from the predominantly Black county lagged Barack Obama's by 6 points in 2012 and 7 points in 2008. But previous elections suggest that those voters were not so much Democratic voters as they were Obama voters turning out for a once-in-a-generation candidate. While Clinton received just shy of 67% of the vote in Wayne County, compared to Mr. Obama's 73% in 2012 and 74% in 2008, John Kerry and Al Gore each won 69% of the vote \u2014 more than Clinton, but not by much. There were many contributing factors to Clinton's shortfall in 2016, and it is inaccurate to attribute the results of the election to a single group. But characterizations of the Midwest often leave out critical constituencies. It's a sentiment Senator Kamala Harris mentioned while competing for the Democratic primary in 2019: \"They usually put the Midwest in a simplistic box and narrow narrative. And too often, their definition of the Midwest leaves people out,\" she told the Detroit NAACP then.\u00a0 \"Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, three major cities where African Americans are, they're going to need a very serious sense of intentionality from the campaign,\" says Williams. \"We're going to need something not just to vote against, we're gonna have to make sure that we're clear about what we're voting for.\" A CBS News/BET poll out this week finds Black voters are engaged in this election, but they are concerned that their vote won't be counted properly, and a majority worry about intimidation at the polls.\u00a0 While millions are able to avoid going to the polls because of expanded absentee voting, there are reasons this may not be effective in Williams' community. \"These absentee ballots will not necessarily guarantee that everybody will get the opportunity to vote. If you live in an urban community like Detroit, and you've moved from house to house, or you've moved in the last few months, there's no guarantee that that application will end up in on your kitchen table. And quite frankly, if all you get in your mailbox is bills, it's less likely that are you even go really want to pick up what's in the mailbox,\" he said. The CBS News/BET poll found that younger Black voters are more concerned than other age groups about the process of voting, whether they can be confident their votes will count and voter intimidation. \"It used to be that we could depend on the United States Department of Justice, to protect our polling sites, our clerk's offices, from this type of intimidation. This time, we're not so sure if the intimidation will actually be coming from the United States Department of Justice,\" Williams said, calling the president's rhetoric around poll watching \"a real threat.\"\u00a0 Nonetheless, 60% of Black voters who plan to cast a ballot in person say they won't be deterred.\u00a0 \"It's important to me,\" said Milwaukee resident Andrea Neal while standing in line to vote early. \"With everything that's going on with the mail \u2014 so, I just wanted to make sure that I had it physically in my hand and placed it in the machine.\" Robert Lewis, a retiree in Milwaukee said he was voting in person early because \"I hope my one little vote might make that change.\"\u00a0 Adam Brewster and Kabir Khanna contributed to this report.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "A United States Postal Service employee has been charged for destroying mail, including absentee ballots, which he allegedly threw in a dumpster, U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced on Monday. The 30-year-old man, identified as DeShawn Bojgere of Louisville, Kentucky, has been charged with the delay or destruction of mail, which is a federal crime. Sometime between October 5 and October 15, Bojgere allegedly threw a \"large quantity\" of mail in a construction dumpster, including about 111 general election absentee ballots from the Jefferson County Clerk's Office that were being mailed for voters to fill out, according to the press release.\u00a0 There were also about 69 mixed class pieces of flat rate mail, 320 second class pieces of mail, and two national election campaign flyers from a political party in Florida. The mail in the dumpster was from a single route for one scheduled delivery day. Bojgere, who no longer works for the Postal Service, admitted to special agents that he was responsible for discarding the mail, according to the press release.\u00a0 All of the mail has since been put back in the system for deliver, and copies have been made for evidence.\u00a0 \"Especially in these times, Americans depend on the reliability and integrity of those that deliver the U.S. Mail,\" Coleman said in the press release. \"Conduct by Postal employees that violates that duty will result in swift federal prosecution.\" \u00a0 Bojgere faces no more than five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and one year of supervised release after serving the sentence, if convicted.\u00a0 There have been several other incidents of suspected absentee ballot interference, some involving ballot boxes. On Monday, police in Boston announced a man was charged for allegedly lighting a ballot box on fire and damaging dozens of ballots. The Boston\u00a0Election\u00a0Department\u00a0said\u00a087 of the 122 ballots inside the dropbox were legible and able to be processed, but the rest were destroyed or unable to be counted. Worldly Armand, 39, was taken into custody late Sunday after officers matched his appearance with the description of a person wanted for the alleged arson, police said. Earlier this month, a fire erupted in an official ballot drop box in Baldwin Park, California, prompting authorities to investigate the fire, which damaged several ballots,\u00a0CBS Los Angeles reports. Arson was suspected.\u00a0 Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

The primary will also be another test of Biden's strength against Bernie Sanders, who landed a surprise win in Michigan in the 2016 Democratic primaries. \"Working families in Michigan need a president who will show up and fight for them, and Joe Biden has proven time and again that he has our backs,\" Whitmer said in a statement. \"Joe Biden has been right there with us in the tough fights. He showed up for the people of Michigan when our health care and our auto industry were on the line. He helped us pick ourselves up and get back to work.

Mr. Trump narrowly carried Michigan in the 2016 general election. Biden is seeking to prove he can win back Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania due to his strength among white working class voters and black voters. A decisive victory in Michigan on Tuesday would help to bolster that argument. Whitmer's endorsement comes after Biden secured victory in several states on Super Tuesday. He has also been endorsed by former presidential candidates Michael Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke. A\u00a0Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll conducted in the days leading up to Super Tuesday showed Biden leading Sanders by seven points in Michigan.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates are now setting their sights on Nevada, South Carolina and the Super -uesday states, after New Hampshire was able to do what Iowa could not: decide a winner on the day of its Democratic nominating contest.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders pulled off a narrow victory Tuesday night with 25.8% of the vote. Pete Buttigieg earned 24.5% and Amy Klobuchar had a strong third place finish at 19.8%. \u00a0Now, candidates are set to face a series of contests where the populations reflect a much more diverse electorate. \"Well one of the things that we have built-in is I think a unique multi-generational, multi-racial coalition,\" Sanders told\u00a0CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0in a one-on-one interview Wednesday when asked about his path moving forward. \"I think what you're going to see in Nevada and you're going to see in South Carolina, is us doing very very well within the African-American community and the Latino community and among working class folks in all the states.\" While Sanders may have finished first in New Hampshire, he did not win the overwhelming victory he saw in his 2016 primary against HIllary Clinton. However, he argues it's not a cause for concern, noting the field is substantially larger than it was four years ago. \"In terms of yesterday's vote, you know last time four years ago, I ran against one person. This time we have eight people. You're not going to get the same percentage of the vote as you did last time,\" Sanders told\u00a0O'Keefe. This year Sanders did win the support of younger voters by large margins \u2013 those ages 18 to 29. He won 51% of that group \u2013 one of his strongest demographic groups, notes\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Sanders earned the lion's share of votes in college towns Durham, Keene and Plymouth, in addition to population powerhouses Manchester and Nashua. Statewide, his support was 8 points lower among women than among men. The Vermont lawmaker also garnered the most support of those earning under $50,000 a year (34%) beating Buttigieg (20%) by double-digits among this group.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was right on Sanders' heels in New Hampshire and broke even with him in terms of delegates awarded in the state's primary with nine apiece. \"We did this by reaching out everywhere. We took no vote for granted and left no vote on the table,\" Buttigieg told\u00a0O'Keefe\u00a0this morning fresh off his second place finish. \"And what we found is that there is tremendous appetite for a message that can deliver bold changes and offer to do it in a way that's unifying.\" Buttigieg currently leads in the delegate count based on Iowa and New Hampshire results, but he avoided calling himself the front-runner, saying his campaign is \"humbled by the road ahead\" and knows how much work there is to do. The former South Bend mayor performed particularly well in New Hampshire's southeastern suburbs of Boston \u2013 including the solid Republican towns of Salem, Pelham and Windham. Among New Hampshire Democrats with incomes of $100,000 or more, Buttigieg (34%) led the field, followed by Klobuchar (21%), and Sanders (18%). Buttigieg led among women (26%), coming out only slightly ahead of Klobuchar and Sanders, who were tied at 23% here. Senator Amy Klobuchar proved once more New Hampshire is always ripe for a surprise, earning third place following a strong debate performance Friday. Klobuchar won the affluent Republican suburb of Bedford, a frequent campaign stop just outside Manchester. She performed best among seniors getting 31% of their support, followed by Buttigieg (24%). \"Because of you, we are taking this campaign to Nevada. We are going to South Carolina!\" Klobuchar announced to excited crowds in Concord, New Hampshire, Tuesday night at her primary watch party. After New Hampshire's springboard, the Minnesota senator will add more than 50 staffers in Nevada by tomorrow, with plans to bolster operations in Super Tuesday states like Colorado, Tennessee, North Carolina and her native Minnesota. Her campaign announced over $2.5 million in new fundraising since polls closed yesterday at 8pm, 61% of whom are new donors. At the same time, neither Elizabeth Warren nor Joe Biden, who came in fourth and fifth Tuesday, were able to crack 10% in the first in the nation primary or pick up any delegates in the Granite state. Both signalled they're soldiering on despite the setback, reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit AP Sarah Ewall-Wice. On Wednesday, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced he was suspending his campaign effective immediately. His exit from the Democratic primary race comes after both Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet both announced they would be ending their presidential bids Tuesday night as New Hampshire results trickled in. There are now eight candidates vying for the Democratic nomination. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Today, the campaign for former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg released endorsements of three members of the Congressional Black Caucus. This comes a day after audio of a 2015 speech at the Aspen Institute leaked, during which Bloomberg can be heard defending the controversial policing practice, stop-and-frisk.\u00a0 Rep. Greg Meeks (NY-11), Rep. Lucy McBath (GA-6) and Rep. Stavey Plaskett (USVI) \u00a0all threw\u00a0 their support behind the former New York mayor, despite the fallout. At an event in Chattanooga, TN\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry\u00a0asked Bloomberg if he or his campaign would ever provide a financial incentive for an endorsement. \"Of course not.\" Bloomberg said. \"But we have supported elected officials around this country for a long time.\" Bloomberg cited his involvement in the 2018 midterm elections as an example.\u00a0 He added that his funding helped put House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the position to begin the impeachment proceedings.\u00a0 He also told CBS News that he doesn't think his comments from the 2015 speech will impact his performance with black voters. \"I think people look at it and they say 'those words don't reflect Michael Bloomberg's way he governed in New York City, the way he runs his company, the way his philanthropy works,'\" he said, adding, \"I think we are going to do very well in the African-American community. They need a good economy, they need better schools, they need more healthcare, they need jobs and those are the kinds of things that I can bring them.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Fresh off her fourth place finish in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren's campaign appears to be canceling ad buys and shifting funds in Nevada and South Carolina.\u00a0 According to Kantar Campaign Media Analysis Group tracking, on Wednesday she canceled nearly $520,000 in ads in South Carolina as well as nearly $60,000 on ads in Nevada, reports\u00a0Ewall-Wice.\u00a0 However, the campaign told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0that\u00a0while it cut more than $370,000 from South Carolina on Tuesday, it added more than $365,000 in Nevada and Maine for TV ads and $40,000 in radio and print ads in South Carolina yesterday.\u00a0 This comes after the campaign also cut down on ad reservations in South Carolina and Nevada last week. When asked about cancellations as Iowa results were still being sorted out, Warren said she always wants to be careful about how her campaign spends its money. \u00a0 But in a fundraising email on Wednesday, Warren acknowledged the New Hampshire results were a disappointment. \"It hurts to care so much, work so hard, and still fall a little short,\" the email read. It went on to urge supporters to \"walk around the block, eat an extra piece of chocolate, hug your pet\u2026 whatever works.\" But then the campaign calls for supporters to get right back to it and \"make a plan \u2013 a plan to fight back and win.\" This reinforces the strategy Warren's team has recently turned to, reported\u00a0Hudak. In an email to supporters ahead of the New Hampshire primary, campaign manager Roger Lau said that after Iowa, \"The remaining three early states of New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina appear poised to keep the race wide open.\"\u00a0 Warren has staffers in over 30 states, and she has recently said frequently that her campaign is \"built to last.\" Lau said the campaign's internal polling shows she is behind only Sanders and Biden in terms of how many Super Tuesday districts she'd be eligible in. \u00a0 But the campaign's shifting of ad money in Nevada and South Carolina suggests that because the first two states didn't turn out as the campaign had planned and hoped, and that now it has to make adjustments for its 1,000 plus staffers in order to have the money to compete on Super Tuesday.\u00a0 IOWA Troy Price\u00a0has resigned\u00a0as the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0has confirmed, after a bungled Iowa caucus saga that has yet to yield any certified final results. Price made the announcement in a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party's State Central Committee.\u00a0 Price's resignation will be effective following the election of an interim chair on Saturday at a State Central Committee meeting.\u00a0 \"The fact is that Democrats deserved better than what happened on caucus night,\" Price said in the letter obtained by CBS News. \"As chair of this party, I am deeply sorry for what happened and bear the responsibility for any failures on behalf of the Iowa Democratic Party. While it is my desire to stay in this role and see this process through to completion, I do believe it is time for the Iowa Democratic Party to begin looking forward, and my presence in my current role makes that more difficult. Therefore, I will resign as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party effective upon the election of my replacement.\" NEVADA Coming off top finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, the Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar campaigns touted Wednesday that they too are swelling their ranks in Nevada as the contest enters its final stretch before Caucus Day on February 22, and early voting is set to kick off in the state in just three days on February 15, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0 The Bernie Sanders operation now numbers more than 250 in the state across 11 offices. Behind Sanders is Pete Buttigieg with nearly 100 staff across 12 offices, Joe Biden with more than 80 staff across six offices, Tom Steyer with more than 60 staff across four offices, Elizabeth Warren with more than 50 staff across 12 offices, and Amy Klobuchar who's campaign is ramping up to 50 staff across one office.\u00a0 Klobuchar faces a unique challenge as one of the last of the top-polling candidates to build out an operation in the contest, where campaigns have had months to recruit and train hundreds of volunteer precinct captains for caucus sites across Nevada. SOUTH CAROLINA Hours after Pete Buttigieg exhibited a strong show of support in the New Hampshire primary contest, his South Carolina team announced an endorsement from S.C. Representative J.A. Moore\u2014arguably the team's most prominent state endorsement to date. Moore, who formerly backed Senator Kamala Harris, told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that the former mayor of South Bend is the \"truest representation\" of the millennial generation. He added that Buttigieg speaks for the next generation in a substantive way. \"He's a 38-year-old mayor of a small town who had the audacity to run for president? What's more millennial than that?,\" asked Moore. \"We've been at war longer than any other generation, we're the generation that has to deal with mass shootings, everything that our generation has faced from a country perspective, Pete in a real way has been an active part of that.\" While Buttigieg's standing has arguably been buoyed by successful outcomes in the first two early states the next two early states \u2014 Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 have more diverse electorates and could pose challenges for Buttigieg and other candidates who have continued to poll low amongst non-white voters.\u00a0 In a\u00a0recent\u00a0Quinnipiac poll, 4% of African-Americans said they would vote for Buttigieg in the Democratic primary. However, Moore maintains that any candidate who doesn't have a long-standing national profile will have challenges with this demographic and others. \"What Pete has shown with the first two contests is that he's able to build other demographics outside of race. He's been able to build coalitions of different ages, regions, [and] urban versus rural support,\" said Moore. \"He's shown from a campaign perspective he has the ability to build a diverse coalition\u2026now the uphill battle is seeing if he can continue to build on coalitions he's already built.\"\u00a0 Along with Moore's endorsement, the campaign announced today that it will be expanding its South Carolina operation to include 55 staff members and that 6 field offices are located throughout the state. Meanwhile,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden was nowhere near New Hampshire when his projected poor performance in the state's primary was realized Tuesday evening. Instead, in an impromptu move, he co-hosted a launch party in the state that he's considered a lynchpin to his success from the very beginning\u2014South Carolina. In an address to at least 100 voters, Biden told the group that despite lackluster performances in the first two states, the race was far from over, reports\u00a0Mitchell. \"We just heard from the first two states \u2014 two of them. Not the whole nation, not half a nation, not a quarter of the nation. Not 10 percent. Two,\" said Biden during his remarks in Columbia Tuesday evening. \"I said this many times, you can't be the Democratic nominee and you can't win the general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters, it's just really simple.\"\u00a0 The same sentiment was echoed on a conference call Wednesday, where the Biden campaign announced another pending bus tour throughout the state and said that Biden would return to the state the week before the primary. As candidates head into this next stretch, Biden assured voters that he recognized the importance of support within the African-American community and made a promise to the group. \"Too often your loyalty, your support, your commitment to this party have been taken for granted, I have never once in my career since I got involved as a kid taken you for granted,\" said Biden. \"And I never ever, ever will.\"\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Congresswoman Lucy McBath's endorsement of Michael Bloomberg adds to a list of \"Frontline\" or battleground district House Democrats that have endorsed the former New York City mayor reports\u00a0CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Six House Democrats have backed Bloomberg: McBath, Haley Stevens of Michigan, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Harley Rouda of California and Ben McAdams of Utah.\u00a0 PACs founded by Bloomberg poured millions into several House races in 2018, including $2.2 million for Stevens' race and $1.25 million to McBath from his Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund. Joe Biden currently has the most endorsements from Frontline Democrats, with eight.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Mr. Trump Tweeted some endorsements of Republican House challengers on Wednesday. Claudia Tenney in New York's 22nd, Nicole Malliotakis in New York's 11th and Wesley Hunt in Texas' 7th were some of the endorsed candidates running in competitive districts. While praising most of their Conservative values, he did mention impeachment in his tweeted endorsement of Malliotakis, \"@NMalliotakis is running for Congress in NY, I know her well, we need her to defeat Max Rose, who voted for Impeachment!\" Rose has $2.5 million cash on hand, according to the latest FEC filing.",

            "article_content": "The Biden campaign announced Friday that President Obama will join the campaign trail for the first time next week to campaign on behalf of his former vice president. Mr. Obama will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, October 21, according to the campaign. Mr. Obama has largely stayed away from the 2020 presidential race, but did make an appearance at the virtual Democratic National Convention in August. Mr. Obama praised Biden in a speech on the\u00a0third night of the convention, and offered a rare rebuke of President Trump. \"I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,\" Mr. Obama said. \"But he never did.\" His critical words, then months out from the election, could offer a glimpse of what's to come when he speaks Wednesday night, when less than two weeks will remain before Election Day. \"For close to four years now, he's shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves,\" said Mr. Obama at the Democratic National Convention about Mr. Trump. \"Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't. And the consequences of that failure are severe.\" Mr. Obama urged voters to cast their ballots, and early, in a new ad for the DNC shared on YouTube this week.\u00a0 \"Millions of Americans are already\u00a0voting. Make sure you stand up and join them,\" he says in the ad. \"There will always be reasons to think your vote doesn't matter. That's not new. What is new is a growing movement for justice, equality and progress on so many issues.\" Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, with onlookers noting how his economic message resonated with working class and non-college-educated workers in the Northeast region that Biden originally hails from.\u00a0 As of October 11, Biden leads the state, 52% to Trump's 46%, according to\u00a0CBS News' Battleground Tracker\u00a0that shows where races stand based on CBS polling and analysis.

            "article_content": "Hundreds of thousands of people packed Hong Kong streets for an annual New Year's Day protest march as the monthslong pro-democracy movement extended into 2020 with further violence between police and demonstrators. Police said they arrested some\u00a0400 people for unlawful assembly and carrying offensive weapons. Hard-line, black-clad youths broke off from the main group of marchers and attacked banks and ATM machines with spray paint, hammers and Motolov cocktails. They smashed crossing lights, ripped bricks from sidewalks and barricaded roads in the downtown financial district.  Banks and businesses identified with mainland China have been frequent targets of hardcore protesters. Police used pepper spray, tear gas and a water cannon to drive off the demonstrators, although a government statement said officers were \"deploying the minimum necessary force.\"\u00a0 Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun told reporters that \"rioters\" hijacked the protest march and at one point endangered police officers by surrounding and throwing objects at them, which led to police ordering the rally to be called off at 6:15 p.m. Thousands, however, remained in the area and many had yet to set off from the starting point at Victoria Park.\u00a0 The massive rally followed overnight clashes between police and protesters on New Year's Eve in a densely populated shopping district. Police also used tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons to break up groups of demonstrators who blocked traffic and lit fires in the street in the working class district of Mong Kok.   Hong Kong toned down its New Year's celebrations amid the protests that began in June and have dealt severe blows to the city's retail, tourism and nightlife sectors.   Eric Lai, the vice convener of the march's organizer, the Civil Human Rights Front, said he hoped to avoid a recurrence of the previous night's violence.\u00a0 \"We hope that the police can facilitate us, rather than provoking us and to fire tear gas and water cannon at us,\" he said.\u00a0 Such marches have often devolved at their conclusion into violence. Both sides have been accused of provoking clashes, and nearly 6,500 protesters, some as young as 12, have been arrested in scores of incidents on streets, in shopping malls and on college campuses.  Recent protests have drawn participants from across Hong Kong society, sometimes numbering more than 1 million and packing the downtown area from Victoria Park to the government office complex a short distance away. Many of those joining in are concerned about an erosion of the former British colony's civil liberties it was promised after being handed over to Chinese rule in 1997, along with a shortage of well-paying jobs and a yawning divide between the city's ruling class and those merely getting by amid soaring housing costs.   This year's event appeared to be significantly larger than in past years, although estimates of the numbers of participants often vary widely between organizers and police.   The protests began in June over proposed legislation that could have allowed residents to be extradited to China, where they could face possible torture and unfair trials. The legislation was withdrawn, but not before the protests expanded to wider calls for reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Protesters Tuesday also gathered at the Prince Edward subway station where police four months ago had rushed in, beating and tear gassing demonstrators who had no way to flee. That incident is among many cited by demonstrators as cases of police abuse for which no one has been held accountable.   The protests show no sign of ending despite an overwhelming victory by anti-establishment candidates in recent elections for district representatives, although their frequency and the level of violence has dropped off somewhat.  In her New Year's address, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the months of protests had brought \"sadness, anxiety, disappointment and even rage,\" and she vowed to tackle underlying social and economic problems in the coming year.  Lam said she would \"listen humbly\" to help bring an end to the protests but also reinforced the importance of the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which China rules Hong Kong and which brooks no challenge to the ruling Communist Party's ultimate authority. Some 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries sent an open letter to Lam on New Year's Eve urging her to \"seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people,\" BBC News reports.\u00a0 In his own New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping referred to the protests, saying \"Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland.\"",

            "article_content": "As polling stations in six states stocked up on disinfecting wipes and Purell Tuesday, both campaigns for former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders announced they were canceling planned dueling rallies in Cleveland, Ohio. \u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports the governor there has declared a state of emergency and urged groups not to hold large indoor events because of the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 Following news of the cancellations, the Biden campaign released a statement saying, \"In accordance with guidance from public officials and out of an abundance of caution, our rally in Cleveland, Ohio tonight is canceled. We will continue to consult with public health officials and public health guidance and make announcements about future events in the coming days. Vice President Biden thanks all of his supporters who wanted to be with us in Cleveland this evening. Additional details on where the Vice President will address the press tonight are forthcoming.\" The Sanders campaign said in a statement that \"out of concern for public health and safety, we are canceling tonight's rally in Cleveland. We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak. Senator Sanders would like to express his regret to the thousands of Ohioans who had planned to attend the event tonight.\" Earlier in the day,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0asked Sanders if the campaign was moving ahead with the evening event.\u00a0 \"We have spoken to the public health officials,\" said Sanders. \"I will double check that but will not do anything that public health officials do not feel is advisable.\" Hours after the rallies were canceled, CNN announced there would no longer be a live audience at the March 15 debate in Phoenix. The press filing center and spin room were also canceled.\u00a0 This sudden change in plans comes as polls show Biden with a sizable lead in Michigan \u2013 Tuesday's biggest prize with 125 delegates.\u00a0 Another big Biden win would be a blow to Sanders, who won Michigan's Democratic primary with his appeal to working class voters four years ago. \u00a0Voters in Washington, Idaho, North Dakota, Missouri and Mississippi will also cast ballots on Tuesday. CBSNews.com will be posting live updates with results from Tuesday's contests and other reporting here.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Joe Biden had a\u00a0heated exchange\u00a0with a construction worker who accused him of trying to take Americans' guns away during a campaign stop in Michigan, one of\u00a0six states holding primaries\u00a0on Tuesday.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0says\u00a0the former vice president was touring an assembly plant under construction for Fiat Chrysler, shaking hands with and praising the electrical workers union members who are building the plant. As Biden was working the room, one man confronted him about his stance on gun ownership. \"You are actively trying to end our Second Amendment right and take away our guns,\" the worker told Biden. Biden replied: \"You're full of sh**.\" Biden continued, \"I support the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment \u2014 just like right now, if you yelled 'fire,' that's not free speech\u2026And from the very beginning \u2014 I have a shotgun, I have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge. My sons hunt. Guess what? You're not allowed to own any weapon. I'm not taking your gun away at all.\" The man repeated his accusation that Biden was \"trying to take our guns,\" and Biden pushed back. \"I did not say that. I did not say that.\"\u00a0 After the worker told him that he had made the remark in \"a viral video,\" the former vice president replied that \"it's a viral video like the other ones they're putting out that are simply a lie.\" \"This is not OK, alright?\" the man said, to which Biden replied, \"Don't tell me that, pal, or I'm going to go outside with you, man.\" The worker then said, \"You're working for me, man!\" Biden responded, \"I'm not working for you\u2026Don't be such a horse's ass.\" It was a remarkably candid exchange that came just a few hours before Biden was scheduled to meet with the leaders of gun control organizations at a stop in Columbus, Ohio. Before the argument, Biden was greeted by hundreds of hooting-and-hollering IBEW members excited to meet the Democratic frontrunner. \"You're the best damn workers in the world,\" Biden said. \"I promise you if I become your president you will never have a better friend in the White House. I'm union from, as my \u2014 I won't say what my grandfather used to say \u2014 but from belt buckle to shoe sole, man.\" MIKE BLOOMBERG Several organizations and philanthropies associated with former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg launched a network of mayors and health experts on Tuesday to help city leaders respond to the coronavirus threat in the United States says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. \"Mayors are on the front lines of the biggest challenges facing the country, including the coronavirus crisis,\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \"But right now, there's an enormous gap between the support the federal government is providing and the support local governments need.\u00a0 This new initiative \u2013 an unprecedented collaboration involving experts from Harvard and Johns Hopkins \u2013 will help fill the gap, and help local leaders work to prevent the spread of the virus and protect the social and economic well-being of communities.\" Through this initiative Mayors will have the opportunity to engage with experts from Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School and discuss crisis leadership and crisis communications. Mayors will also be able to discuss among themselves some of the best practices and lessons learned from recent experiences.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders\u00a0apologized to\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0on Monday for an op-ed a campaign surrogate wrote that claimed Biden has a \"big corruption problem.\" Sanders told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte, \"It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared.\"\u00a0 The op-ed,\u00a0published in The Guardian\u00a0by law professor Zephyr Teachout, said Biden \"has perfected the art of taking big contributions, then representing his corporate donors at the cost of middle- and working-class Americans.\" Her op-ed came as tensions have been rising between Sanders and Biden. Over the last week, Sanders and his team have\u00a0criticized Biden's past remarks on Social Security funding, using a video that takes Biden's comments out of context and appears to show him agreeing with former GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan about privatizing the program. \"I think it is important to know where a senator has come from and where his head is at. And Joe's record on [Social Security] is a little different than mine,\" said Sanders. Biden responded Monday by telling VICE News that the Sanders campaign \"lied\" about his record. CBS News asked Sanders if he approved of his supporters' aggressive online attacks on his opponents. \"No, I really don't,\" he said. \"If anyone knows me, what I believe is we need a serious debate in this country on issues. We don't need to demonize people who may disagree with us.\"\u00a0 He added, \"I appeal to my supporters: Please, engage in civil discourse\u2026And by the way, we're not the only campaign that does it. Other people act that way as well. I would appeal to everybody: Have a debate on the issues. We can disagree with each other without being disagreeable, without being hateful. That is not what American politics should be about.\" Later Monday, Biden thanked Bernie for his remarks on\u00a0Twitter. \"These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary,\" the former vice president added. \"Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.\" \u00a0 Following an event in Iowa on Tuesday, Biden again told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0that he had accepted Sanders' apology.\u00a0 CALIFORNIA Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg this week rolled out a handful of new endorsements in California, their latest as the Super Tuesday contest braces for the beginning of early voting on February 3.\u00a0Steyer's new backers\u00a0were announced after the opening of his new field office in Fullerton, the campaign's fourth office in the state.\u00a0 The\u00a0Bloomberg campaign announced his latest endorsers\u00a0on the heels of his trip last week through California,\u00a0his fifth day\u00a0campaigning there. Not on the list was Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who\u00a0met with Bloomberg on Friday.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the former Kamala Harris endorser\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that she would not endorse \"during the primary, but rather focus on unifying around the Democratic nominee \u2014 and the ultimate goal of beating Trump.\" IOWA Amy Klobuchar continues to roll out endorsements in Iowa and earned the support of three more local state legislators on Tuesday. The Quad City Times called her \"the one,\" and the New York Times issued its dual endorsement of Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 In Iowa,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0say Klobuchar now has the endorsement of 16 current state legislators, the most of any candidate. After hosting a series of conversations centered on climate change, State Senator Rob Hogg announced his support for Klobuchar Tuesday morning. In a statement, Hogg said Klobuchar is a \"strong leader for climate,\" adding that her \"plan for quick action on climate\u2026is achievable and is guided by science.\"\u00a0 Hours later, at a press conference in Des Moines, State Representatives Chris Hall and Monica Kurth also announced their endorsement of Klobuchar. Kurth had previously endorsed Cory Booker, and Hall used to be political director for Beto O'Rourke in Iowa.\u00a0 The legislators praised Klobuchar's ability to work across the aisle and reach voters in rural and urban districts. State Representative Ruth Ann Gaines, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus in Iowa and the first state legislator to back Klobuchar, said she initially had concerns about Klobuchar's support among African-Americans. \"But I knew they would come,\" Gaines said of black voters. \"I knew the problem was there weren't too many people in the race for African Americans to really see and be able to trust.\" Gaines said Klobuchar's support with African-Americans \"is stronger with Senator Booker leaving the race.\" Meanwhile, Warren picked up two coveted endorsements from state legislators who had previously backed Booker. State Representatives Jennifer Konfrst and Heather Matson are first term lawmakers who flipped their districts in the 2018 election. Warren is second only to Klobuchar in Iowa statehouse endorsements.\u00a0 \"After a long Iowa caucus campaign, Elizabeth Warren has emerged as the best candidate to defend our shared values, ensure opportunity for all and give a voice to those too often left behind,\" Matson said in a statement.\u00a0 \"Nothing is more important to me than electing a president who has a vision for ensuring everyone in our country has a chance at the American dream,\" Konfrst said in a statement. And former Vice President Joe Biden received an endorsement from DNC member and Iowa labor activist Sandy Opstvedt. \"Joe Biden has always - and will always - stand up for labor in Iowa and across the country, because that's who he is,\" Opstvedt said in a statement. NEVADA Pete Buttigieg's campaign has\u00a0donated more than $13,000\u00a0to the campaigns of local and state elected officials here in Nevada, state campaign finance disclosures reveal. The contributions, first reported\u00a0by The Nevada Independent, far exceed that of the former South Bend mayor's\u00a0top-polling competitors.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the only reported donations from the campaigns of\u00a0Joe Biden,\u00a0Bernie Sanders,\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, and\u00a0Tom Steyer\u00a0are to local and state parties, though Steyer\u00a0had donated generously\u00a0to several Nevada Democrats in 2018 before announcing his run for president. NEW HAMPSHIRE New Hampshire Youth Movement Action has endorsed Sanders. The political arm of the first-in-the-nation primary state's progressive youth organization has enlisted 10,000 members throughout the state. In an internal vote among movement leaders, Sanders received over 80% support.\u00a0 \"It's clear that Sanders is a movement candidate that has been backing a lot of the issues our generation cares about before we were born,\" New Hampshire Youth Movement State Director Dylan Carney told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 SOUTH CAROLINA Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and the House Democrat campaign arm held a call with reporters today about the state dropping the requirement of a full Social Security number for voter registration, a result of one of several litigation lawsuits Democratic groups have filed to deal with voter suppression.\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee have filed more than a dozen cases in Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Minnesota and Florida to deal with issues of early voting, ballot order laws, and in the case of South Carolina, voter registration issues. South Carolina was previously one of three states to require a full Social Security number for voter registration, along with Tennessee and Virginia, but now only requires four digits. \"Unfortunately we continue to see the levels of laws aimed at preventing people from voting, particularly young voters, first time voters, African-American voters and other voters of color,\" said DCCC general counsel Marc Elias. \u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports the voting rule change impacts the roughly one million non-registered, but eligible, voters in South Carolina.\u00a0 Elias said the rule was a good example of a \"hurdle that really makes no sense\" and said the case will stay in the jurisdiction of a federal court through November 2020, in case a voter who doesn't have his or her full Social Security number is denied registration. Clyburn commended the effort by the state Democratic party, the DCCC and the DSCC and said for them to get involved \"is a testament to how effective voter suppression has been, especially throughout the South.\" \"Everybody knows one of the things people are very, very reluctant to do is give out their Social Security number. I'm very reluctant to give it out, and I get a little bit unnerved when people, even legitimate businesses, ask me for it,\" Clyburn said during the call. He and DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos added that they have a ground game in place in the state, through meetings with local fraternities and sororities and faith based groups, to register eligible voters. \"We will do it this year like we have never done it before.\" He added, \"We're just waiting for implementation time.\"\u00a0 In addition to the challenge to unseat Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham, House Democrats have to defend Joe Cunningham in the First Congressional District, which he won by less than two points in 2018. WITNESS LIST Whether the Senate hears from witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Trump is a question that will be considered in the coming days, after the House impeachment managers and the president's legal team have finished their opening arguments, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 This is the approach advocated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who says he's modelling the process on Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. In that trial, House managers interviewed three witnesses, and video excerpts from the interviews played on the Senate floor during the trial.\u00a0 At the top of the list of witnesses Democrats would call if they have the opportunity are former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both of whom they believe have more information about the pressure campaign Mr. Trump is accused of carrying out against the Ukrainian president. One of the articles of impeachment charges charges Mr. Trump with abuse of power for making the announcement of investigations of Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden a pre-condition for the release of congressionally approved Ukrainian military aid and a White House visit.",

            "article_content": "A New Hampshire\u00a0poll\u00a0released by Monmouth University today shows a close race in the \"first in the nation\" primary state with Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field at 20 percent, followed by Former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says New Hampshire neighbors Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren register at 18 and 15 percent, respectively. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar earns 6%, Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer come in at 4% and entrepreneur Andrew Yang registers at 3%. Compared to Monmouth University's last New Hampshire survey in September, support for Buttigieg's has grown the most \u2013 up by 10 points. Sanders' has increased his share of support by 6 points, while Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden's numbers have dropped by 12 points and 6 points respectively. Even if the field winnows, the race appears neck and neck. The poll probed New Hampshire voters on who they would support if the nomination race came down to just the four leading candidates come the February 11th primary.\u00a0 In this hypothetical race, Biden's vote share grows by the most, earning 5 points to 24%. Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren all gain 3% by the same measure. Of note, another 5% of voters \u2013 half of whom back Gabbard -- say they will not cast a ballot for any of these candidates in a four-way contest. This poll does not qualify any additional candidates for the debate stage. To qualify, contenders must raise money from 225,000 unique donors (with at least 1,000 apiece in 20 states) and reach polling thresholds in qualifying surveys. Candidates can hit that mark with either four different polls of at least 5 percent, or two polls of at least 7 percent from early primary and caucus states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. Only five candidates have made the stage: Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Sanders, Steyer and Warren. Yang, who recently launched a #PollThePeople twitter campaign to encourage the DNC to run their own polls told CBS News last night in Merrimack, New Hampshire, he has enough resources to stay in the primary through the spring, regardless of his debate participation. \"If we don't make the debate, we're growing, independent of media opportunities.\" Yang remarked JOE BIDEN Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is set to endorse former vice president Joe Biden's presidential bid, according to multiple Democratic officials familiar with his plans.\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0says the official endorsement is set to be made Friday morning in Los Angeles and Garcetti is expected to be named a national campaign co-chairman. News of the endorsement was first reported by The New York Times. Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia also announced this week that he would be endorsing Joe Biden, ahead of touring an infrastructure project with the former vice president in his city. Garcia had been a prominent backer of Kamala Harris, campaigning for the then-presidential candidate\u00a0throughout the country.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Biden has courted\u00a0former Harris endorsers\u00a0in the Super Tuesday state, where he has\u00a0jockeyed with Bernie Sanders\u00a0to capture the lion's share of the state's more than 400 pledged delegates.\u00a0 \"Biden is ready to lead our country on day one,\" Garcia\u00a0tweeted Thursday. \"He will stand up for the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and working class families. He can unite our party. Let's go!\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0also says New Hampshire state Senator Martha Fuller-Clark has decided to back Biden. Fuller-Clark is the first DNC member from the state to endorse a 2020 presidential candidate. \"I certainly think that the international crisis that we're facing over the last week was one of the key reasons that I felt it was important to call up now and support the Vice President, as our next president,\" the five-term state Senator told CBS News.\u00a0 \"He has unparalleled experience with regard to foreign and International Affairs, and there's no question in my mind that we need someone with that type of background and experience to be running the country over the next four years.\" Fuller-Clark continued, \"I also believe that his best position to pull the country together and to beat Trump, which could not be more essential right now that we have a candidate who is in the best position to do that.\" According to CBS News' count, seven of New Hampshire's fourteen Democratic state Senators have backed a candidate. All four members of New Hampshire's congressional delegation have refrained from picking a presidential contender so far.\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Mike Bloomberg's presidential campaign has brought on yet another operative with ties to Capitol Hill. Gisel Aceves, the political director of BOLDPAC, the super PAC for members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, is joining the former mayor's campaign, according to multiple people familiar with the move. Aceves began informing members of the caucus of her job plans today, the people familiar with her plans said. Aceves referred questions about her next move to the Bloomberg campaign, which didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.\u00a0 She previously worked for Emily's List, the DSCC and on the reelection campaign of Senator Michael Bennet.\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports Bloomberg continues to staff up, with more than 500 personnel deployed nationwide and stationed at a Times Square headquarters in New York. Those being hired or sought out to join the campaign are those with specific experience in the 14 states holding Super Tuesday contests or that have been part of general election campaigns in the past. PETE BUTTIGIEG Maryland Congressman Anthony Brown endorsed Pete Buttigieg Thursday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Brown is the first Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) member to endorse Buttigieg and is Buttigieg's first national campaign co-chair. \"Our country needs a president who can heal our divides and restore decency to our nation's highest office,\" Brown said in a statement. \"Pete's message is not defined by exclusion but welcomes everyone into the fight to tackle our nation's greatest challenges.\"\u00a0 Brown is also a Harvard alum and a military veteran. He also traveled to Iowa with Buttigieg on a recent campaign swing. Buttigieg also received endorsements from local leaders in Iowa on Thursday, including Iowa state Representative Kristin Sunde and Kirsten Anderson, a women's rights advocate who previously endorsed New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. TOM STEYER Tom Steyer's son Sam met with a couple of College of Charleston sophomores at a local coffee shop Thursday to hear from students about their thoughts on student debt and other issues that concern them most. The 31-year-old co-founder of a budding San Francisco-based clean energy company told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that the message he hopes to share a message of unity with college students.\u00a0 \"We find when we talk to college students that they are really informed and thoughtful, really idealistic, really practical, we agree with them on a lot of priorities\u2014climate change, living wage, access to healthcare,\" Sam Steyer said. \"What we want to say to them is in 2020, there are more people across the country who share our vision but in order to enact it we need to win the presidency and we need to win up and down the ballot, we need to win in Congress, we need to win in state and local races, and that's a matter of turnout.\"\u00a0 This is Sam Steyer's second visit to the Palmetto State, where his dad's campaign now boasts the largest number of paid staffers \u2014 84 \u2014 and four field offices.\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP Mr. Trump will hold his first rally of the election year on Thursday night in Toledo, Ohio. The rally will be his first since tensions heightened with Iran in recent weeks and since Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided to delay sending over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0notes that this rally comes in the middle of a swing through Midwest states that secured his 2016 victory and will be crucial to winning the general election in November. The last two rallies of 2019 took place in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and his first two of 2020 will be in Ohio and Wisconsin. Trump won Ohio's 18 electoral votes by 8 points in 2016, but the state picked Obama in 2008 and 2012. Watch the rally\u00a0here. \u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Ahead of Juli\u00e1n Castro's visit to the state this weekend for Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says DNC National Committeewoman Allison Stephens has joined the former Obama housing chief in endorsing Warren. Once\u00a0one of Castro's more prominent backers\u00a0in the state, Stephens praised both as \"unapologetically progressive.\"\u00a0 \"Elizabeth Warren shares Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro's vision of an America that works for everyone,\" Stephens said in a statement\u00a0released by the campaign. STATE-BY-STATE SOUTH CAROLINA With just 51 days until the South Carolina Democratic primary contest, the Biden campaign announced Thursday that it will launch the \"South Carolina Soul of the Nation\" surrogate bus tour to take place days before the former vice president's visit to the state next week. Senior adviser Symone Sanders, actor Sean Patrick Thomas, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and others will headline the 4-day swing scheduled to begin next Wednesday. According to the campaign, the team will stop by beauty shops, historically black colleges, and other sites in 15 of the state's 46 counties.\u00a0 By the end of the swing, 39 counties will have been visited by either Biden or his surrogates this cycle.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Biden \u2014 who last visited South Carolina in November \u2014 has continued to\u00a0outpace\u00a0his competitors by double-digits and has managed to pick up key\u00a0endorsements\u00a0during his absence. According to the campaign, the bus tour is comparable to the \"We Know Joe\" surrogate bus tour that began in Iowa Tuesday featuring former Secretary of State John Kerry and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. While half a dozen Democratic presidential candidates have rolled through Iowa on buses this political season and Mayor Pete Buttigieg wheeled through all 10 counties in New Hampshire during his bus tour in November, Biden's surrogate tour will be the first of its kind in South Carolina this election cycle. But in years past, Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have used bus tours to connect with voters in the state ahead of presidential primary contests. In January 2008, the Post and Courier\u00a0reported\u00a0that Democratic hopeful John Edwards and Republican candidates John McCain and Fred Thompson were all zig-zagging through the southern coastal region of the state known as the Lowcountry just two weeks before both state parties' presidential primary contests. South Carolina state Senator Marlon Kimpson officially\u00a0endorsed Biden on Monday and is scheduled to participate in the tour. \"What we are seeing in Iowa is that pressing the flesh, slapping backs, kissing babies, works and this is the type of campaigning that South Carolinians are used to--the grassroots-style knocking on doors, where you interact with voters,\" said Kimpson. \"We got a lot of new entrants in this election spending tons of money and South Carolinians appreciate [Biden] having the old-school-style retail politics...it's an indication not that he thinks that somebody is snipping at his coattails but his appreciation and love for our state.\" Separately, South Carolina Representative J.A. Moore acted as a tour guide for Elizabeth Warren surrogate Maurice Mitchell \u2014 the national director of the Working Families Party \u2014 as the two met with a local African American business owner at in North Charleston Thursday afternoon. \"[Warren] has a whole platform that's just focused on that corruption\u2026so that everyday people, working folks, and small businesses and entrepreneurs have a fighting chance and have the support of their government,\" Mitchell told a local business owner. \"A Warren presidency, not only would it be light years away from Donald Trump, it'll be something that we've never experienced and it's time.\" Moore \u2014 who was an early endorser and ardent supporter of California Senator Kamala Harris \u2014 said this is his first public campaign-related event with a presidential team since Harris suspended her campaign in December. At the time he\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News that Harris' support would have to be earned by other Democratic contenders. Now, a month after Harris' departure, Moore has been in close talks with half a dozen presidential campaigns including Warren's as he weighs his next move. In an interview with\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0Thursday, Moore said it's important for presidential campaigns and candidates to visit his diverse district\u2014where he says more than 27 countries are represent \u2014 and to remember the state even after the primary in February. \"South Carolina, to me, is a very valuable state, nationally. We can become a purple state, we just have to have the investment at the national level to do it,\" said Moore. \"We need the presidential campaigns to have deep roots here in South Carolina after February\u2026I'm going to make sure whoever I endorse moving forward that's going to be a commitment that I demand.\" SOCIAL ETIQUETTE Facebook is reaffirming its commitment not to fact-check or ban political ads on its platform,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports. In a press release Thursday, the social media company outlined new transparency features for its ad library and tools for users to opt in or out of targeted ads, but doubled down on its increasingly controversial position. \"While Twitter has chosen to block political ads and Google has chosen to limit the targeting of political ads, we are choosing to expand transparency and give more controls to people when it comes to political ads,\" Facebook said. \u00a0 The company says after it spoke to various activist groups and campaigns of all sizes and political persuasions it learned how much those groups value Facebook's targeting tools. It also pointed out that 85% ad spending by presidential candidates is targeted at audiences of 250,000 or more. \"Ultimately, we don't think decisions about political ads should be made by private companies,\" the statement reads. Facebook also reiterated its calls for clearer rules and regulations from the government, a sentiment echoed by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in his own Facebook post later in the day. \"There are a number of areas where I believe governments establishing clearer rules would be helpful, including around elections, harmful content, privacy, and data portability,\" writes Zuckerberg. \"I've called for new regulation in these areas and over the next decade I hope we get clearer rules for the internet.\" CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE The Democratic campaign arm raised about $14.4 million in December, bringing their total to $124.7 million in 2019. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos told reporters Thursday that this is $20 million more than what they had raised in 2017, says\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0\"We got to hang on to this majority because we know what's at stake in 2020. We are going to play very, very aggressively in, what in some cases, has been long held Republican territory... we've got the resources to get the job done,\" Bustos, an Illinois Democrat, said.\u00a0     Bustos noted more than three-quarters of the DCCC's Frontline members, House Democrats in vulnerable 2020 districts raised more than $500,000. One of those members, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, announced they raised $900,000 in the fourth quarter. Bustos and DCCC Executive Director Lucinda Guinn emphasized that House incumbents and candidates should continue to emphasize hyper-local issues and \"run like a mayor,\" as Bustos put it. House Democrats have also been promoting their passage of HR-3, a bill that lowers prescription drug costs. This push comes as Republicans hit hard on vulnerable Democrats for their vote on impeachment in the closing months of 2019. The DCCC heads said impeachment did not make a huge impact on their strategy or on polling numbers. \"Look, we ran on our 'For the People' agenda. So the people who are Frontline members right now, they knew about keeping things local. In these tougher districts, believe me you don't obsess about Donald Trumps. I think most people in America know how you feel about Donald Trump,\" Bustos said. \"I think that's the winning formula, to talk about what matters to people.\" Guinn added, \"The list of things that's on people's minds does not include impeachment right now.\" When asked about if they've tested split-ticket voting with leading Democratic Presidential front-runners in Trump-won districts, Guinn said it's still too far to gauge that.\u00a0 \"We can control what we can control. We are going to run aggressive, smart strategy on the issues that matter to voters in each individual district,\" she said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Symone Sanders, a senior campaign adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, believes her candidate is unique in his desire to hear from a variety of perspectives. In an interview with CBS News' Major Garrett for this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast, Sanders said it was a \"testament\" to Biden that he had broadened his circle of advisers. \"We have a good mix going on,\" Sanders said about the makeup of Biden's campaign. \"And I do believe that's how we were able to, frankly, capture the nomination and that's how we'll defeat Donald Trump.\" Sanders also disputed that there was any sort of \"palace intrigue\" in the campaign, with different advisers jockeying for favor. \"There is this notion that he may not be listening to some people, that there are some people that do not have his ear, and I would just like to dispel that myth. The strength of Joe Biden is the fact that he is a listener, he has empathy, he is always constantly critically thinking about things and how he can retool them and make them better,\" Sanders said. Sanders was the press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders' insurgent campaign in 2016, but she said that she is working with Biden this election cycle because she believes he \"correctly diagnosed what is happening in America.\" Sanders believes that Biden's message that \"we are in a 'battle for the soul of this nation' is more on point now more than ever.\" \"I believed in what Joe Biden said, I absolutely agreed with him, and that's why I joined his campaign,\" Sanders said. Sanders slammed the Trump campaign for trying to \"throw a number of salacious conspiracy theories and project them onto the vice president,\" such as the claim that Biden is mentally unfit for office. \"I think that he has demonstrated time and time again that he can rise to the occasion, while Donald Trump does not,\" Sanders said about Biden. She also said that the Biden campaign was working hard to engage a variety of voters, including African-American voters and working class white voters. \"Our strategy is dynamic, it is tailored to specifically what state we are talking about,\" Sanders said. \"It's not going to be easy to beat Donald Trump. We are not running as if it will be easy.\" For more of Major's conversation with Sanders, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on\u00a0Art19,\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0GooglePlay,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher.

            "article_content": "The CBS News Battleground Tracker is back, explaining what's on voters' minds and regularly providing detailed snapshots of the U.S. presidential election in each state throughout the 2020 campaign. In addition to the specific polls we conduct in key states in a given week, the Battleground Tracker map includes our best estimates and presidential race ratings in every state. This includes states we've polled extensively and states where we've surveyed few voters but have lots of other data. What exactly is the Battleground Tracker, and where do the numbers come from? Here are five things to know. We take a state-by-state approach to describing the race and measuring public opinion, since the presidency is won in the Electoral College, not by the national popular vote. Indeed, relying too much on national polling can be misleading, as 2016 reminded us. The Battleground Tracker looks at individual states, focusing on competitive ones. And we translate each candidate's current support to the electoral vote scoreboard. Our state-by-state approach also gives a sense of what voters in different parts of the country think and feel of this year's candidates, national issues, and local matters. While surveying voters across the country is an integral part of the Battleground Tracker, this is more than your typical poll. It's really a big data project. We combine polling, voter files (from L2 Political), U.S. Census data, and historical trends to get a clear picture of what's going on in each state. Here's how we put together that combination: This approach achieves better estimates in states without as much polling. In 2016, for example, scarce polling in certain states like Michigan or Wisconsin led some to believe they were not as competitive as they turned out to be. That picture might have been improved by considering that these states were full of the same kinds of voters shifting to the Republican Party elsewhere. We combine all of this data using a statistical technique called multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP). One advantage of this method is that we use trends across the entire country to inform our picture of a particular state. For example, if we see white working-class voters across the Midwest shifting their support, we use this information to more precisely estimate Michigan. We collaborate on data collection and modeling with YouGov, building on our joint U.S. House model in 2018 and delegate model during this year's presidential primaries. (You can scroll to the bottom for more details about MRP.) Our job is to tell you where races stand today and explain why \u2014 and what might change. Over the course of the campaign, voters will become more familiar with candidates and some change their minds. In 2016, for instance, late-deciding voters propelled Donald Trump to victory in key states. Unlike an electoral forecast, we're estimating each candidate's current support, incorporating all the data we've collected up to this point. For instance, if we estimate Joe Biden at 49% in a state with a margin of error of 3 points, we're confident that his support there is between 46% and 52% today, not that the final result will be in that range. Similarly, our ratings reflect the current state of the race. A state that's leaning toward one party today may be reclassified as a toss up down the road if it becomes more competitive. Our race ratings are based in part on this estimate, on the size of the potential error in the estimate, as well as on trends in each state's recent history and the current campaign. There's nothing here to account for forward-looking uncertainty \u2014 nothing about changing economic conditions or rollercoaster debates, for example. We fully expect movement before the first vote is cast, so we'll update everything regularly throughout the fall. That brings us to scenarios. Down the road, the Battleground Tracker will offer plausible scenarios for how the election might unfold. We'll do this using a combination of statistical simulation and tweaking some of the assumptions underlying our model, resulting in a range of possible outcomes. Here's an example. One of the most challenging things to figure out will be turnout: who's actually going to bother to vote? Modeling who is likely to vote is a perennial challenge that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to make even thornier this year. In our baseline model, we estimate which voters are casting ballots based on both what they tell us they're planning to do and historical patterns in their states. In our scenarios, we'll slightly alter the model's parameters to explore what could happen if, for example, large swaths of voters stay home (perhaps for fear of getting sick) or if there's a surge in voting by mail (also possible given intense interest in this election). We'll roll out our scenarios later in the campaign, so check back for them! While we're taking a different approach than traditional polling, the Battleground Tracker is based on rigorous methods from the worlds of political science, survey research, and statistics. Moreover, we have a strong track record employing similar models at CBS News over the past few years. Our 2018 model\u00a0performed particularly well, steadily tracking Democratic candidates' improvement in key congressional races and the eventual Blue Wave in the U.S. House. In fact, our\u00a0high-turnout scenario pretty much nailed the final result, as historically high turnout powered Democratic gains. We also examined two turnout scenarios in this iteration. If turnout is higher overall and among people under 30, non-whites, and college degree holders, relative to recent midterms, Democrats stand to gain an estimated 235 seats pic.twitter.com/1NmkVZYAXL If you want to know more about the data and statistical model we use \u2014 and don't mind a bit of jargon \u2014 then keep reading... First, we survey thousands of registered voters across the country and make sure to draw larger samples in battleground states, which we expect to be more competitive. The most important survey questions we ask for estimation purposes are how likely they are to vote and which candidate they would vote for today. We then determine how people's vote intentions are related to their characteristics like age, gender, race, education, past vote, where they live, and so on. Each voter has a certain combination, which we'll call a \"profile\" for shorthand. For example, one possible profile is a 36-year-old, black, college educated female, who votes in DeKalb County, Georgia. Change any one of these characteristics and you get another profile. For each possible profile, we run a multilevel regression on the survey data to estimate how many voters of that specific profile intend to vote for each major candidate. The regression includes the voter characteristics above, as well as state and county effects (the levels in \"multilevel\"). The next step is estimating how many people of each voter profile live in each state. For this we use a combination of U.S. Census data and voter files, which includes counts of voters at very granular levels, such as voting precincts. In each state, we multiply the total number of voters of a given profile by the proportion of voters with that profile choosing a candidate (the \"post-stratification\" step). Aggregating across all voter profiles in a state, we finally get the estimate of that candidate's statewide vote share. In Maine and Nebraska \u2014 the two states that award electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 we also estimate candidate support in each district.

There are three candidates left in the race: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard.\u00a0 Tuesday's contests are the first after Super Tuesday, when Biden won 10 of the 14 states holding primaries. Michigan in particular will be critical for both Biden and Sanders. Sanders won Michigan in the 2016 primary by a narrow margin, but Biden is hoping to prove that he has viability among the state's white working class voters, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer endorsed\u00a0Biden on Thursday. It's also a crucial swing state for Democrats in the general election: President Trump won the state by just over 10,000 votes in 2016, becoming the first Republican to win the state since 1988.\u00a0 Going into this Tuesday's contests, Biden has the delegate lead, with 648 delegates to Sanders' 563. Gabbard has earned one delegate. Here is a breakdown of what states will vote on Tuesday and what time polls will close: A\u00a0Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll\u00a0conducted in the days leading up to Super Tuesday showed Biden leading Sanders by seven points in Michigan. After Biden's victory in South Carolina, he was endorsed by former presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke.\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\u00a0dropped out of the race on Wednesday after Biden's sweep on Super Tuesday and backed him.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with former RNC Chair Reince Priebus that aired Sunday, October 18, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to CBS News political analyst Reince Priebus, who was formerly Republican Party chairman. He was also the first White House chief of staff for President Trump, and he joins us from Kenosha, Wisconsin, his hometown this morning. Good morning.\u00a0 REINCE PRIEBUS: Good morning, MARGARET.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Open up The Washington Post today, I see that you have, as they report, re-entered the Trump campaign mix. They say you're advising him on strategy, including coaching him in that recent NBC town hall. Says you are concerned about the president's chances. Is that right? You're concerned that the president is headed for a loss? PRIEBUS: No, not at all. In fact, I'm not concerned about that at all. I'm- I'm concerned about early vote. I'm concerned about absentee ballot voting, but I'm always worried about early vote and absentee ballot voting. I haven't reemerged. I've always been helpful to the president, helpful to the RNC. But look, you know, early vote and where we're- we're at in a pandemic and having five times more people vote in Florida than ever before, these are unprecedented times. The polling is all over the map. This is something that's going to come down to the wire, and I hope and expect the president to win. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what are the battleground states that you think he can win? Because as you heard from our poll, Joe Biden is at an advantage here. PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, MARGARET, I mean, these polls are really, really complicated to measure. I mean, what we have in this country we have never seen before. We have- we have regional- aside from, you know, working class white voters, suburban women, one of the other things that's going on in this country is that President Trump is winning in these rural parts of the country in unprecedented numbers. I mean, we have northern Wisconsin, this like center of Wisconsin to the north, President Trump won by 18 points in 2016. Today, he's pushing 30 points ahead in rural America with enthusiasm off the charts. Yes, it's a little bit down in the suburbs. But the hard thing for these pollsters, MARGARET, as you bring up, is that they can't measure this kind of disparity between the rural parts of this country and what's happening in the suburbs. So, the real-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think he's going to win Wisconsin? PRIEBUS: Well, I got to tell you, I- I saw the CBS poll this morning, and I'm not spinning you, I was slightly encouraged by it because in the RealClearPolitics average in Wisconsin in 2016, the president was actually down by six and a half points and he won. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. PRIEBUS: But also, MARGARET, Gary Johnson got 106,000 votes as well in 2016. So he's not- Trump didn't just win Wisconsin in 2016 when they said he would lose by six and a half. He won. Plus another conservative candidate got 106,000 ballots. So when you ask me-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah-- PRIEBUS: Go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: --one of the things though, with Wisconsin that are Anthony Salvanto, our pollster, pointed out, though, is that base, that white, non college educated voter that came out strongly for the president back in 2016, that margin is- is shrinking in terms of what we are seeing right now. Why do you think there is that erosion? PRIEBUS: Well, I don't know if- if it's an erosion or not, MARGARET. I mean, you know, clearly I think one of the things that you're going to see over the next couple of weeks is that the president's going to be pivoting, talking about the economy. I think this upcoming debate is going to be really important that the president is that, you know, likable, fun, have a good time. Let Joe Biden speak, and let Joe Biden defend the Obama economy. Let him defend why ISIS was running wild and burning people in cages. Let Joe Biden defend why he was the one guy that didn't want to go forward with the Osama bin Laden raid. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. PRIEBUS: Let him defend the Iran deal. Those are the things that I think, you know, pivoting to the economy that those voters are going to be listening to. But, you know, look, I think it's really complicated. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- PRIEBUS: I don't think anyone can predict early vote and what's happening-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well and it-- PRIEBUS: --right now in this country.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it is hard to predict and it is incredible that we are in the midst of a pandemic that is shaping so much, which is, I mean, how do you not address that though? Do you really believe that there is not a political cost to the deaths that we are seeing in this country? I mean, I look at Wisconsin where the president just had his rally, and the majority of likely Wisconsin voters tell us the response is going badly. 49% of them say the Trump administration has hurt Wisconsin's effort. So, they think the president is hurting-- PRIEBUS: Well clearly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --not helping.\u00a0 PRIEBUS: Well, I- I think it's going to be important for the president to remind everyone that it was he who shut down most travel from China. It was he who developed a task force. It was he that helped pass the- the CARES Act, at two trillion two weeks after the country was shut down.\u00a0 I mean, while by the way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But hospitals are getting overwhelmed-- PRIEBUS: --while by the way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --now. PRIEBUS: Well, look, granted, MARGARET. Sure, no one likes what's going on in this country. No one likes that their kids are at home and no one likes that a lot of these states are shut down by Democrat governors. That's all true-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. PREIBUS: --but the question is, would this person over here, Joe Biden, have done things better or differently? And I don't think Joe Biden's made that case-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. PRIEBUS: But- but- but the point is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. PRIEBUS: --is that I think that-that the upcoming debate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. PRIEBUS: -- is a great opportunity for the president to make that case to the American people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well we will be- we will be--\u00a0 PRIEBUS: I think he is doing well in Wisconsin. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching. We'll see if he takes your advice. Thank you Reince. We'll be right back.",

            "article_content": "Stay-at-home orders issued across the U.S. have made it a challenging time to run a political campaign. And it's even more difficult to ask voters \u2014and supporters \u2014 for cash to help fuel these operations. In three weeks, more than 16 million U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits as efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus shut down businesses across the country. With so many people suffering economic devastation because of the novel coronavirus and uncertain of what the future holds, candidates are faced with a conundrum.\u00a0 \"How do you ask someone to give money to a campaign right now,\" wondered Charleston County Democratic Party Chair Colleen Condon. \"I don't know how you do it. I don't know how anybody does it.\" It's a question that candidates and supporting organizations are grappling with across the nation. Many struggle with asking for cash even in the best of times, but for better or for worse, money is still what fuels a campaign, so now, it's about striking a delicate balance.\u00a0 \"On fundraising, it's definitely a huge challenge, especially for down-ballot candidates who don't have as big of a network to work with,\" said Ianthe Metzger, deputy director of campaign communications for Emily's List, which supports progressive women candidates. \"If we do get back to normal in a few months, candidates are going to need the resources to get them over the finish line, so we're not telling them to stop fundraising, just to kind of really talk to people,\"\u00a0 she adds. \"People are incredibly stressed. They're stressed about their job, they're stressed about are they going to bring the virus home to their kids,\" said Dr. Kayser Enneking, a Democrat running for a Florida state House seat. \"This is not the time for me to call and say, 'hey, by the way you know, I know you want better government and that costs a lot of money to do.' And so, that's been really challenging because we know how political campaigns run \u2014 they run on money.\" One Republican House strategist told CBS News he expects small-dollar fundraising is going to be hardest hit by this pandemic.\u00a0 \"If you're a restaurant or retail worker that's been furloughed, it's really hard to keep chipping in your $10 or $15 contribution online when you're worried about when your next paycheck is going to come,\" he said.\u00a0 \"We're telling candidates, they're going to have to exercise some judgment on a lot of this right now,\" said Ross Morales Rocketto, co-founder of Run for Something which focuses on recruiting progressive young candidates for down-ballot races. \u00a0 His organization and others are encouraging candidates to continue making calls to supporters, including those who donate money. Ted Terry, the first vice chair for the Georgia Democratic Party, is running for a county commission seat. He said during this pandemic, he's continued to make calls because people are continuing to donate when they can. \"A lot of times you're calling people that you already know are...big Democrats,\" said Terry. \"They already care about these issues \u2014 it's just a matter of do they have money now or are they waiting till the end of the month because they just gave their discretionary fund to support the local food bank and\u2026next month, they'll be able to support your campaign.\" In some cases, the calls have shifted from candidates explaining their own efforts to checking in with their constituents and their well-being. If people are struggling, it's best to nix the hard ask. Run for Something has also suggested candidates go through their lists and ensure they're not calling health care workers or other essential personnel on the frontlines of the pandemic and those who may have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic.\u00a0 At the same time, down-ballot campaigns that are no longer holding in-person fundraising events have turned money-raising gatherings into virtual ones. Zoom happy hours have been popping up for candidates up and down the ballot. One held a movie night online and another brought donors together with online Bingo. Ted Terry said his team is beginning to experiment with Zoom fundraisers too, and in a couple weeks he plans to integrate yoga into his online fundraising. A yoga instructor has offered to conduct an online class and donate all the proceeds to his campaign.\u00a0 \"We're not trying to just be like 'hey let's all get on a Zoom call and just talk to each other for 30 minutes,\" said Terry. \"We're trying to think outside the box.\" Even without the overt asks, donations are going up in some cases. Health care professionals-turned-candidates have, for example, seen a bump in funding as more people determine they want to support people with this kind of expertise representing them in government.\u00a0 Other candidates with health care backgrounds have become a vital resource for constituents.\u00a0 \"They are texting me and they're saying, 'you know, I have a fever. Do you think I need a COVID test?' [Or] '...should I be wearing a face mask? You know, is it okay for me to go to the grocery store?' I mean just some basic questions that they need somebody to turn to and because they know that I have a public [profile], they know how to find me and they know I'll answer it and answer it as truthfully as I can,\" said Enneking, a University of Florida anesthesiologist. While Enneking said fundraising is a crucial part of campaigning, she doesn't believe it's appropriate for her right now. \u00a0 \"I don't want people to think that I am using this virus as a political tool to highlight the fact that I'm a doctor,\" said Enneking. \"What this is about is saying 'yes, I am a doctor and I understand the science, and I understand that policy affects health outcomes, and that's why we need people that understand medicine here.'\" Others not in the health care field but with strong views on the current system here have addressed the coronavirus in their own fundraising pitches.\u00a0 In an email to supporters, M.J. Hegar, who's running to unseat Texas Senator John Cornyn solicited donations under the subject line, \"Help me defend our health care.\" Others have sent out similar pleas by\u00a0 text message. \"We have to do [fundraising] with empathy and putting our values first,\" said Andrew Feldman from the National Democratic Training Committee, which serves as a resource for Democrats running at every level. \"Connecting with potential donors with the values your campaign believes in, which are issues largely that we're seeing that if implemented would have helped this crisis\u2026 issues like affordable universal health care, sick leave. I mean, these are things that Democrats have been leading on for a long time.\" In terms of hard numbers, it's unclear what the pandemic's overall impact on campaign cash funds the pandemic will be. According to one Democratic strategist, Democratic House candidates started off 2020 with very strong numbers, but there was a dip towards the tail end of the quarter. There will likely be a clearer picture at the end of the second quarter. Same goes for Senate candidates. \"I think the impacts of not being able to do events and doing virtual fundraising won't really hit until next quarter,\" said an aide on a Democratic Senate campaign. \"People have concerns about their own livelihood, so they're less inclined to donate. I'm sure we'll see that in the next quarter.\" \"Democratic Senate races will continue to raise the resources they need, but right now they are all focused on supporting their communities, providing reliable information, and putting forward real solutions to help address this crisis,\" said DSCC spokesperson Stewart Boss.\u00a0 In a\u00a0memo\u00a0sent in early March, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer told members to \"be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic. While large gatherings fundraiser may be impractical or illegal depending on your location, you can still sit down and make fundraising calls and touch base with donors asking how they are.\" \"Being able to come off of Super Tuesday with a big win, really did put some wind in our sails to get through March. Obviously we wanted more wind, but you never know what happens when the whole world stops,\" Texas House Republican candidate Genevieve Collins told CBS News. She also pointed to delays in the passage of the stimulus package as a potential issue boosting small dollar donations. \"In a time where we really have to meet people at their most basic needs, to stall something...really hurts the majority of Americans and is very distasteful in Dallas. And people are mad about it and are quite frankly, capable of giving $25. You know they're not giving $2,800 but they're giving what they're feeling, what they're comfortable to give.\" WinRed, the platform used by Republican candidates to raise funds, had anticipated seeing a decrease in funding as coronavirus precautions went into effect but did not see a significant dip in the first quarter. The platform hauled in nearly $130 million for Republicans over the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, the organization ActBlue which Democrats use for fundraising has not released fundraising totals since the outbreak began, but it has promoted resources to help candidates and progressive organizations navigate asking for cash under the current circumstances.\u00a0 When civilian life will be returning to some semblance of normal remains unknown. With that in mind, multiple candidates confirmed to CBS News, they're already considering options should they be forced to carry on a virtual campaigns heading into the general election. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The nominating process for the Democratic presidential race\u00a0kicks off on Monday\u00a0when\u00a0Iowa holds its first-in-the-nation caucuses. After a lengthy campaign cycle that started in July 2017,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0say\u00a0democratic candidates now have their first chance to prove they can win over voters. \u00a0 The modern-day Iowa caucuses date back to 1972, but it wasn't until Jimmy Carter won in 1976 that Democrats began paying any real attention to the Hawkeye State as a key stop on the road to the White House. Since 1972, seven of the 10 candidates who have won the Democratic Iowa caucuses have gone on to be the party's nominee. While the winner of the Iowa Democratic caucuses has often become the party's nominee, only two of those winners have gone on to win the presidency: Mr. Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008.\u00a0 Iowa offers candidates just 41 of the 3,979 pledged national delegates available in the primary process. A candidate needs 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination. While Iowa is somewhat inconsequential in the mathematics of the nominating process, its position as the very first contest can give candidates a shot of momentum that helps them in the next states to vote. With that out of the way, let's take a look at the candidates and what they're doing in the final moments before the caucuses.\u00a0 Sanders shocked the political world four years ago when he nearly upset Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses. Sanders entered the 2020 cycle with a strong base of support from his 2016 run and has seen a boost in support in January that put him atop many Iowa polls. Deputy Iowa state director Bill Neidhardt says if the campaign wins Iowa, it will be directly attributable to the campaign's strong field organizing in Iowa. Sanders has focused on issues that matter to working-class voters in the final weeks of the Iowa campaign, including Social Security and healthcare, and he believes they can do well in working class towns. The campaign also anticipates a strong performance with young voters and Latinos, a growing demographic in Iowa. The campaign is heavily dependent on high turnout for success in Iowa, though. \"If for some reason turnout is down for whatever reason it is, I think that's absolutely the stuff that keeps us up at night,\" Neidhardt said.\u00a0 Biden has presented himself as the candidate who is best suited to defeat Mr. Trump and unite the country by restoring values he says have been lost during Mr. Trump's presidency. A senior Biden official said the campaign is targeting unaffiliated voters and Republicans who may be turned off by Mr. Trump. The senior campaign official said increasing turnout in small and rural communities is \"going to potentially play to our advantage.\" Biden led most Iowa polls from the moment he entered the race until the late summer and early fall when other candidates began to overtake him. After Thanksgiving, he renewed his focus on Iowa, spending more time in the state than he had previously all cycle. He held more than half of his campaign stops in December and January in Iowa and held many events in rural communities and mid-sized towns.\u00a0 Buttigieg tells voters he'll bring a different set of experiences and a Midwestern upbringing to the White House. Buttigieg argues that he can win over Republicans who are frustrated with Mr. Trump and spent some of his final days in Iowa revisiting counties that swung from Obama to Trump. Iowa communications director Ben Halle told CBS News that the campaign expects to do well in suburban communities, but also in rural towns that pivoted to Mr. Trump in 2016. Halle said success in Iowa would send voters an important message about electability. \"It makes a statement to be able to do well in those places for saying 'I am the nominee that can bring the country together' and 'I am the nominee that can beat Donald Trump,'\" Halle added. Buttigieg's polling cooled a bit over the summer after he shot onto the national scene, but he has since rebounded, remaining in the top tier for several months. His team steadily built out its operation in Iowa to try to capture enthusiasm from the consistently large crowds. Halle said organizers and volunteers have embedded within communities and will be on hand Monday night from the moment caucus-goers step out of their cars.\u00a0\u00a0 Warren jumped out to an early lead in organizing strength in Iowa. She surprised some by building out such a large operation before the months of the caucuses. But many Iowa Democrats say that this helped propel her rise in the polls in the late summer and early fall. Her campaign's theory of the case has been organize, organize, organize. Even as Warren has slipped from her peak atop the polls, some Iowa Democratic leaders say her field operation could lead to a strong finish on caucus night. Many Iowans were drawn to her for being known as the candidate with the plans - even if they didn't like everything that she was offering. At her final events in Iowa, she has stressed that she believes that a woman is best suited to take on Trump and that she's in the race to \"fight back.\" Klobuchar has focused her attention on going everywhere in Iowa. While this strategy has been hampered by the impeachment trial in Washington, Klobuchar was still able to get out her message to every corner of the state. She has steadily climbed the polls starting in the fall and enjoyed a bump in fundraising following the November debate. A campaign official tells CBS News that January was its best online fundraising month of the cycle. Klobuchar campaign officials believe they will have opportunities to pick off supporters from Biden, Warren, and Tom Steyer on Caucus Night where those candidates may not reach the viability threshold. Officials tell CBS News that they believe Klobuchar will do well in the north and northwestern part of the state, which are closer to her home state of Minnesota. They also think that she will do well in counties where caucus-goers will have only seen or heard from Klobuchar in person, a strategy that could pay dividends.\u00a0 Andrew Yang has joked that his campaign has grown from his e-mail contact list to an operation capable of raising $16.5 million in a single quarter. He made rather infrequent visits to Iowa over the summer and fall, but spent the final 17 days before the caucuses crisscrossing the state, while some of his rivals where held up in Washington for the impeachment trial in an attempt to win over people who were still finalizing their decision in the final weeks. Yang has called Iowa a \"magical place\" capable of sending a message to the rest of the world that there's real support behind his plan to give American adults $1,000 a month and his vision \"rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy.\" Businessman Tom Steyer entered the race much later than his competitors and had his busiest month of campaigning in Iowa in January. On the trail, Steyer has been hammering home the message that he's the \"unconventional\" politician who can take on Mr. Trump in the general election. He reminds caucus goers that then-candidate Trump beat someone he describes as \"the most prepared candidate in history,\" in Hillary Clinton after steamrolling through 16 Republican challengers during the primaries. Steyer says he can take on President Trump when it comes to the economy and often reminds Iowans that as president he will make addressing climate change his \"number one priority.\" While the bulk of the attention has been on the Democratic candidates, the Republican Party is also holding caucuses on Monday night. President Trump visited Des Moines on Thursday night for his first campaign rally in Iowa this year. Hundreds of people in the overflow crowd watched Mr. Trump speak on a big screen outside the venue. He won Iowa by nearly 10 points in 2016, and in a recent New York Times poll, Mr. Trump defeated all of the top-5 Democratic candidates in general election head-to-head matchups. He is expected to easily defeat his two challengers, former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.\u00a0 IN THE POLLS There was a final twist in the Iowa caucus campaign on Saturday night when it was announced that the highly anticipated Des Moines Register/CNN poll\u00a0would not be released\u00a0after someone reported an issue with the way the survey was conducted. The Register's executive editor, Carol Hunter said in a statement that it \"appears candidate's name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate.\" CNN's vice president of political coverage and political director David Chalian said the poll's release was canceled \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The final\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0released on Sunday morning shows a tight race at the top. Biden and Sanders both had 25%, followed by Buttigieg with 21%, Warren at 16% and Klobuchar at 5%. Everyone else was polling below 5%. The survey has a margin of error of\u00a0 +/- 3 points.\u00a0 CAUCUSING 101 The caucuses start at 7:00pm central time.\u00a0Iowans will gather at one of the 1,678 precincts\u00a0across the state at community centers, schools, town halls, and churches. Only registered Democrats can participate in the Democratic caucuses, but people can change their party affiliation on caucus night. In those rooms, people won't be privately casting a vote for a candidate. Instead, they will stand in front of their friends and neighbors to publicly show which candidate they support. Rather than a straight popular vote, people in those precincts will be electing delegates that represent each candidate. The caucus rules are among the most complex in American politics. In most precincts, candidates need at least 15% support from the room in order to win delegates. That's known as the viability threshold.\u00a0 The process begins with people going to stand with fellow supporters in the area designated for whichever candidate is their top choice. That process is known as the first alignment.\u00a0 After that, supporters who back a candidate that hit the viability threshold will be locked in. Everyone else has a few options during a process known as realignment: join a viable candidate's group, try to win over other supporters of non-viable candidates to hit the threshold, join another candidate on the cusp of viability or go home. When the caucuses are over, the state calculates how those delegates from all 1,678 precincts equate to delegates sent to the county, congressional district, and state conventions. The number of state convention delegates a candidate has will be reported on caucus night as \"state delegate equivalents.\" SEEING RESULTS On caucus night, the Iowa Democratic Party will release three sets of results: the popular vote from the first alignment, the popular vote after the realignment, and the number of state delegate equivalents a candidate wins,. The person who wins the most state delegate equivalents is technically the winner of the Iowa caucuses because that determines how many delegates a candidate wins for the national convention.\u00a0 Depending on the size of the precinct, the process can take a couple of hours, but some results are expected to start coming in around 9:00 p.m. ET. The bulk of the results will likely come in a couple of hours later.\u00a0CBS News will have results\u00a0on the air and CBSN will be broadcasting live from Iowa. You can also follow the results on CBSNews.com.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Iowans take their first-in-the-nation nominating contest status seriously. As a result, though, they are not even safe in their own homes from politicians.\u00a0 In the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Democrats are bombarding the local airwaves with ads as polls show it's a tight race heading into Monday's contest. \u00a0 In just one local newscast on Wednesday morning in Des Moines, viewers were subjected to no less than ten political ads. Two were from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, two from Senator Elizabeth Warren, and one each from former Vice President Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, and Tom Steyer along with a couple of outside groups. Since the 2020 presidential election cycle began, Democratic candidates and other groups have spent more than $71 million on TV and radio ads in Iowa leading up to the caucuses so far. In 2016, candidates and other groups spent a total of $79.8 million overall on the presidential race heading into the caucuses on both the Democratic and Republican side.\u00a0 With days still to go, Steyer has spent more than $16 million on political TV and radio ads in the state, the most of any candidate. Sanders has spent nearly $11 million so far, and Buttigieg has spent nearly $10.5 million. Warren and Yang have each spent more than $6 million on TV ads. While Biden has spent around $4.2 million on ads, a super PAC supporting him, Unite the Country, has spent a separate $4.5 million. Klobuchar's campaign has dropped nearly $4 million on Iowa ads. Even Senator Michael Bennet, who has barely registered in polls, has spent just over $1 million. Final pitches hitting the airwaves have run the gamut from solving issues like high drug prices and health care to Washington corruption. In many cases, the ads amount to condensed versions of stump speeches, boiled down from rallies on the campaign trail to a minute or less.\u00a0 One Sanders' spot features the viral moment from his Queens, New York rally, where the senator asked\u00a0 \"Take a look around you and find someone you don't know. Maybe someone doesn't look kind of like you. Are you willing to fight for that person, as much as you're willing to fight for yourself? If you and millions of others are prepared to do that, not only will we win this election, but together we will transform this country.\"\u00a0 Biden is using a similar pitch to the one he highlighted during a campaign stop last week in Waukee, Iowa. \"It's said in here, your character is revealed\" a narrator says under an image of the Oval Office. Warren leaned into the electability argument with an ad titled \"She Can Win,\" featuring an Iowan who caucused for Trump in 2016 but now supports Warren. In another ad, she reminded voters she used to be a registered Republican. And yet another highlights her Republican family members and working-class roots. \u00a0 Klobuchar is pushing a final message of unity. \"Iowa it's time to choose,\" an ad begins before touting the recent string of endorsements for the Minnesota senator. \"Klobuchar can unite our party and perhaps our nation that's why she's visited all of Iowa's 99 counties,\" it continues.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Buttigieg is playing up generational change. \"It's time to turn the page from a Washington experience paralyzed by the same old thinking, polarized by the same old fights, to a bold vision for the next generation,\" Buttigieg says in the 30 second ad. In his final TV pitch, he calls for breaking \"from the old politics\" to unify the nation. Andrew Yang made a similar argument. In his latest ad, released one week before the caucuses, he used a quote from one of the debates. \"If you're a parent you've had this thought: our kids are not alright,\" Yang says.\u00a0 And while Steyer is trailing in recent Iowa polls, Steyer is using momentum he's seen other early state polls to help propel him across the finish line in the Hawkeye state.\u00a0 Some candidates have not held back with their criticism of Democratic opponents on the trail in recent days, but there's one commonality all of the candidates' recent Iowa TV ads have had: They are not attacking each other. \"For the most part, there have been no direct attacks amongst each other,\" said Mitchell West, senior analyst for Kantar/CMAG, which tracks television ads. \"I thought they would have gone a little bit negative, but so far they have not.\"\u00a0 According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, that was not the case with the large Republican fields heading into Iowa in 2012 and 2016.\u00a0 Several outside groups have paid for ads criticizing specific candidates, but Democratic presidential candidates' TV ads themselves have all zeroed in on the same foe: President Trump.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's campaign, meanwhile, hasn't really focused on TV ads in Iowa, although he did hold a rally in Des Moines on Thursday. Mr. Trump has two longshot challengers, former Masscahusetts Governor Bill Weld and former Congressman Joe Walsh, in the race for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump's campaign is dispatching 80 surrogates to caucus sites around the state on Monday.   Adam Brewster contributed reporting from Iowa.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "President Trump touted the strike on Iran's Qassem Soleimani and bashed Democratic candidates at a rally Tuesday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Democratic presidential candidates took the stage for their seventh debate. The rally also came as the Senate readies itself for Mr. Trump's\u00a0impeachment trial, which is expected to begin on Tuesday, January 21. After reminiscing about his narrow 2016 win in the Badger State, and rattling off what he considers to be some of his greatest accomplishments on trade and jobs, the president launched into the story of the death of Soleimani. The Iranian military leader's death has been seamlessly rolled into the president's campaign material.\u00a0 \"At my direction, the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist, number one terrorist,\" the president told his enthusiastic audience. \"You know who that is? Qassem Soleimani, number one terrorist in the world.\" The president capitalized on Soleimani's death to hit Democrats who questioned whether the death of Soleimani was the best strategy for the U.S. In particular, Mr. Trump criticized Senator Elizabeth Warren, telling the crowd he doesn't believe the reporting that Sanders told Warren in 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidency. \"I don't believe that Bernie said that, I really don't,\" the president told his supporters. Tuesday's rally is Mr. Trump's second campaign rally of 2020, coming less than a week after his\u00a0rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday. The president's rally pace is only expected to pick up as the election year continues. Mr. Trump eked out a win in Wisconsin in 2016 by just under\u00a023,000 votes, at least in part because he was able to\u00a0mobilize white working class voters\u00a0in rural areas and small cities and towns across the state. Last week, The Associated Press\u00a0reported that Wisconsin Republicans froze out the remaining longshot GOP contenders challenging Mr. Trump, Bill Weld and Joe Walsh, by deciding to place only the president's name on the Republican primary ballot. The two can still make it onto the ballot if they submit 8,000 signatures by January 28. During his rally, the president called impeachment the \"greatest hoax\" ever \"perpetrated\" in the United States.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden says he won't raise taxes on anyone with annual income of less than $400,000. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has tweeted, and stated in the second debate, that his Democratic rival would raise taxes to a level never seen before in America.\u00a0 Both candidates can't be correct. But neither is entirely wrong, either. Biden's tax increases are focused on the wealthy and target\u00a0three key areas: raising the top income tax rate to 39.6% for those making above $400,000; hiking the rate on capital gains to 39.6% for investment income above $1 million; and imposing a 12.4% payroll tax on income above $400,000. Payroll taxes currently only apply to the first $137,700 of an individual's income. Although Biden could indirectly impact the taxes of middle income folks as well, his tax plan includes about $265 a year in additional benefits for average Americans. That includes increase in dependent care credits and a $15,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers.\u00a0 Factoring in all of Biden's spending plans to be paid by those higher taxes, a September study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school found that middle-income Americans would end up with higher paychecks, not lower ones, under the former vice president's plan.\u00a0 Similarly, the economic forecasting arm of debt rating firm Moody's concluded that federal spending under Biden would stimulate the economy more than higher taxes would act as a drag, causing GDP to\u00a0rise 1 percentage point faster a year under Biden's plan than Trump's.\u00a0 All told, Biden's tax plan is projected to raise as much as $4.1 trillion over a decade. Trump's more threadbare proposal would cut taxes by an additional $300 billion by the end of his second term, primarily for the wealthy and corporate America. This would follow a more than $2 trillion tax cut he and a GOP-controlled Congress passed in 2017 that cut taxes for Americans making between $40,000 and $75,000 a year by an average of $720, according to analysis from the Tax Foundation, but also largely flowed to corporate and wealthy taxpayers.\u00a0 Here's how the two tax plans stack up and how much more, or less, Americans would pay under each. Answer: Not directly.\u00a0Biden would raise the top marginal tax rate on income over $400,000 from 37% to 39.6%, restoring it to the rate under President Obama. Most Americans \u2014 with average annual salary in 2019 of $54,099, according to the Social Security Administration \u2014 would continue to pay the same income tax rate. That's also true for payroll taxes and taxes on investment income, which would be raised for top earners but remain the same for everyone else. Middle-income Americans could still take an indirect hit from Biden's tax increases. The issue has to do with corporate taxes, which Biden would like to raise to 28%, from the 21% they were lowered to under Mr. Trump in late 2017. Corporations are not people; most corporate taxes are paid by investors. But companies tend to pass some of the cost of higher taxes on to consumers in the form of higher prices or to workers in the form of lower wages. The question is how much. And on this point, economists disagree.\u00a0 The\u00a0Joint Committee on Taxation has found that as much as 25% of the cost of a corporate tax increase could land on workers. But the tie between taxes and wages is not very strong. Wages for the average worker did rise 3% in 2018 following the late 2017 corporate tax cut, but that wasn't much more than the 2.6% they had risen the previous year. Record corporate profits meant companies had room to swallow extra costs.\u00a0 The Wharton analysis found the impact of a corporate tax increase would lower the average workers' take-home pay by 0.4 percentage points, or $216 a year. But the top 1% of wage earners would pay nearly $50,000 more a year in income and payroll taxes under the Biden plan. Answer: Perhaps.\u00a0Mr. Trump and his advisers a year ago floated the idea of a 15% income tax rate for middle-income Americans, down from the current 22% for individuals making up to $85,000 a year. But Mr. Trump hasn't talked much about that recently, and certainly hasn't made it a big part of his re-election campaign. What's more, an August analysis from the Tax Foundation said that it would be hard to cut tax rates for the middle class, and much of the benefit in any income rate tax cut would end up going to the wealthiest Americans.\u00a0 \"The current structure of the tax code makes this particular policy idea difficult,\" the group, which describes itself as independent, wrote. More likely, taxes will gradually rise during Mr. Trump's second term. That's because portions of the 2017 tax cuts will begin to expire as early as 2022. Mr. Trump has talked about extending the cuts, but he would need congressional approval for that. Answer: It's going to swell no matter who wins the election.\u00a0Biden's tax plan would raise as much as $1.4 trillion in four years, according to Moody's. But he would also spend $3.9 trillion \u2014 that's an increase of $2.5 trillion in the national debt. Mr. Trump's second-term plan, on the other hand, is to lower taxes by an additional $300 billion. But remember that the 2017 change under Mr. Trump has already reduced federal tax revenue by about $300 billion a year. Factor that in, and the national debt, because of Mr. Trump's tax plans, will increase by another $1.5 trillion in his second term. And that's on top of the $6.5 trillion the debt has already risen in Mr. Trump's first term, for a potential two-term increase of $8 trillion.",

            "article_content": "With 50 days until the election, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the Green Party will not be on the ballot in the state during the general election. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster,\u00a0that means clerks will not have to reprint 2.3 million ballots and can begin sending absentee ballots to voters who have requested them. Clerks are required to begin sending ballots by Thursday to the more than 1 million Wisconsinites who have requested absentee ballots. In a court filing last week, the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) reported that clerks recorded sending more than 378,000 ballots, though it wasn't clear how many, if any, had actually been mailed. In the 4-3 decision, the court said it would be too chaotic to change the ballot at this point. \"We agree with the Commission that requiring municipalities to print and send a second round of ballots to voters who already received, and potentially already returned, their first ballot would result in confusion and disarray and would undermine confidence in the general election results,\" the court said in its decision. \"Under the circumstances presented here, it would be unfair both to Wisconsin voters and to the other candidates on the general election ballot to interfere in an election that, for all intents and purposes, has already begun.\" In August, the WEC declined to put Green Party candidates Howie Hawkins and Angela Walker on the ballot over questions about whether the party had submitted enough valid signatures to qualify. A complaint filed with the WEC said Walker's address wasn't correctly listed on some of the paperwork, making those signatures invalid. Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn joined the three liberal justices in ruling that the Green Party would not be on the ballot. Liberals narrowed the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3 in April when current liberal Justice Jill Karofsky defeated conservative former Justice Daniel Kelly. The Green Party played a significant role in the 2016 election in Wisconsin. Jill Stein, the party's nominee in 2016, got more than 31,000 votes in an election where President Trump won the state by less than 23,000 votes. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania can't certify its November ballot until the state Supreme Court decides whether the Green Party will be on it. The Court's order that the Secretary of State not finalize the ballot came on the deadline for counties to begin processing applications for mail-in ballots. At issue is whether the Green Party properly filed affidavits when nominating their candidates with the state. A Commonwealth Court judge last week ruled that the party's presidential but not vice-presidential nominee met the requirements to be on the ballot. A local Democratic politician and county chair, represented by a Pittsburgh lawyer who has litigated for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, appealed to the Supreme Court and requested a stay to keep the ballot from being certified ahead of a decision. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the results of the case could have major impacts on the outcome of the presidential election, considering that in 2016, the Green Party's nominee received over twice as many votes as President Donald Trump won by in the state. The case has also held up elections offices in Pennsylvania as they receive more mail-in ballot applications than ever before. Statewide, counties have already received over 1.8 million applications, more than voted by mail in the primary three months ago. Wanda Murren, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said all of the state's counties began processing applications before today's deadline and they will begin sending ballots as soon as they've been certified and printed. Fifty days from Election Day, President Trump made a rare California stop on Monday, as wildfires rage in there and in Oregon and Washington,\u00a0CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0and\u00a0campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0report. At a wildfire briefing in McClellan Park, California, the president blamed the fires on poor forest management, even though many of the forests in California are federally managed. \"When trees fall down after a short period of time, about 18 months, they become very dry,\" the president said. \"They become really like a matchstick.. you know, there's no more water pouring through and they become very, very -- they just explode. They can explode.\" Dozens of fires burning more than 3 million acres - roughly equivalent to the size of Connecticut - have killed at least 35 from California to Washington State, as hundreds of thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes. Plumes of smoke is destroying air quality up and down the West Coast, and last week yielded hazy, orange images of San Francisco. Mr. Trump has approved emergency declarations for West Coast states. The president claimed Monday that the climate will \"start getting cooler,\" contrary to scientific evidence of global warming. Mr. Trump has long denied man-made effects on climate change. Secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, Wade Crowfoot, told Mr. Trump at Monday's briefing that \"if we ignore that science and sort of put our heads in the sand and think it's all about vegetation management, we're not going to succeed together in protecting California.\" Mr. Trump replied, \"It'll start getting cooler. You just watch. \" Crowfoot countered, \"I wish science agreed with you.\" The president rebutted, \"Well, I don't think science knows actually.\" And while the coronavirus pandemic, economic downfall and struggle against racial injustice sit central stage ahead of this year's election,\u00a0a survey released last month\u00a0shows 81% of the American public believes global warming is probably happening. This measure has remained stable and largely bipartisan over the past two decades according to Resources for the Future, an American nonprofit that conducts independent research into the environment and energy. Countering the president's trip to California, Joe Biden spoke in Delaware today on what he is labeling a fourth national crisis -- climate change -- confronting the nation alongside the pandemic, the economic fallout and the push for more racial equality.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports that Biden claimed the Trump administration's lack of focus on climate issues has allowed large fires and worse storms to barrel through the country. Using a frequent criticism of the president's on the safety of America's suburbs, the Democratic nominee argued it was not \"integration\" but natural disasters posing the biggest threat to Americans at home. \"Wildfires are burning the suburbs in the west. Floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coast,\" Biden said. \"If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze? If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater?\" As he left the speech, Biden was asked about his middling support among Hispanic voters in recent polls. Biden said his support among Hispanics was \"much higher than\" the president's but admitted his numbers \"gotta go higher.\" He hopes that will start tomorrow as he makes his first general election visit to Florida on Tuesday. Black women are often considered the \"backbone\" of the Democratic Party, but Black men could play an equally crucial role in the\u00a0upcoming presidential election. In 2016, 13% of African American men voted for Mr. Trump compared to 4% of African American women. Those data points are not lost on the Biden campaign, which unveiled a series of testimonial-style ads Monday featuring African American men \"chopping it up\" inside a black-owned barbershop in North Carolina.\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0got an exclusive preview of some of the ads, which will air on TV and digital platforms nationally and in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Campaign officials say they offer a snapshot of how some African-Americans view the president's policies, such as his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \"We see what this president's currently doing. We've got 170,000 Americans dead because of COVID. There's this lack of trust,\" a man named Antoine says to a group of men seated in socially-distanced barber chairs around the shop. Another man chimes in, saying, \"This country is starving for good leadership right now.\"\u00a0The 30-second spot, entitled \"Trust,\"\u00a0builds on the campaign's \"ShopTalk\" series, an initiative that has also featured roundtables to engage Black men.\u00a0A second ad, \"Get This Right,\"\u00a0touts Biden's plan on criminal justice reform, including ending mandatory minimum sentences and changes to private prisons and cash bail. Kamau Marshall, director of strategic communications for the Biden-Harris campaign, says the ads highlight the candidates' proposals for \"real change.\" Marshall added, \"These latest ads showcase genuine conversations happening across the country about those plans amongst families and friends, during a critical time.\" The campaign plans additional outreach this week to African-American voters through a mix of virtual events. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is releasing two new digital ads supporting the Biden-Harris campaign, and specifically targeted towards minority voters. The ads, shared first with\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro,\u00a0argue a Biden-Harris administration can provide positive change for minority communities. \"Okay you're right, voting can't fix everything. It can't even fix most things. But your vote can...\"\u00a0one ad says\u00a0before listing numerous policy proposals such as universal pre-K and forgiving student debt. Another\u00a0ad\u00a0centered around healthcare costs starts out with a clip from Harris about disproportionate COVID-19 deaths among minority communities. \"Here, if the disease doesn't get you, the hospital bills will. It's the same old story,\" the ad opens up with, before talking about Biden's loss of his son, Beau, to cancer. \"He almost had to sell his house to pay the bills, he knows the struggle we face,\" the ad says. The ads are running digitally and on audio streaming services (such as Spotify) in English and Spanish in six battleground states: Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. SEIU has invested $150 million to mobilize 32 million Black, Hispanic and Asian American and Pacific Islander voters who didn't vote in 2016, and says they'll be running ads through election day. \"Unlike the traditional swing voter whose support shifts between Democrats and Republicans, infrequent voters of color are more likely to align with Democrats on issues, but swing between voting and not voting at all,\" said SEIU's national political director Maria Peralta. \"Boosting their turnout is an opportunity not only to affect the election, but to build power that lasts beyond the election.\" These ads, which begin running on Tuesday, make it now 14 total ads the group has ran for the presidential race. The Florida Democratic Party called out Miami-Dade County's Republican Mayor Carlos Gimenez Monday, questioning why the Trump-backed mayor won't allow the American Airlines arena--home to the Miami Heat--to be used as a mail ballot drop-off location. In a\u00a0tweet\u00a0on Monday, the Florida Democrats posted an\u00a0article\u00a0about the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections allowing for the Tampa Bay Rays' Tropicana Field to be used as a mail ballot drop-off location with the question to Gimenez, \"Another stadium being used as a secure ballot drop-off location. Why wouldn't [Carlos Gimenez] want to open [the Miami Heat's] stadium for voting as well?\" Gimenez, a two-term mayor in Miami-Dade County, is running against Democratic incumbent Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell to represent Florida's 26th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives in the upcoming election.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that, according to\u00a0information\u00a0provided by the Miami-Dade County supervisor of elections, mail ballots can be returned in person at the Dade County Elections Department or the Elections Department's branch office before 7 p.m. on Election Day, by mail, at an early voting location secure drop box, or at a voter's precinct on Election Day. Early voting begins on October 19 in Miami-Dade County and there are currently more than 30 early voting sites\u00a0listed\u00a0on the county's website. Also in Florida, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum made headlines Monday after announcing for the first time publicly that he identifies as bisexual during an interview with his wife on the 'Tamron Hall Show.\" In July,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reported that the former Florida gubernatorial candidate spoke about recovery from alcoholism and steps forward in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted on Instagram just months after an\u00a0incident at a Miami hotel\u00a0in March, where police found him \"inebriated\" alongside another man who may have overdosed on crystal methamphetamine. Gillum's wife and the mother of his three children, R. Jai, said in the recent interview with Hall that many people don't understand bisexuality. \"Bisexuality is just something different,\" said Mrs. Gillum. \"I just believe that love and sexuality exist on a spectrum. All I care about is what's between us and what agreement we make.\" The Michigan Senate is planning to vote this week on a bill that would allow clerks to begin processing absentee ballots on the Monday before Election Day, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. A spokesperson for state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said the Senate plans to vote on the bill, but expects the bill to be changed to include a sunset clause so that it would only apply to the election this November. Republican state Senator Ruth Johnson, who sponsored the bill, tells CBS News she expects there are enough votes for it to pass the Senate. The bill that would allow clerks in cities with at least 25,000 people to begin opening ballot envelopes the Monday before the election. Ballots would have to stay in their secrecy sleeves to prevent anyone from seeing actual votes ahead of time. Michigan is one of the\u00a0battleground states\u00a0where election officials have called for being able to start processing ballots, but not counting them, before Election Day to help speed up results. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein\u00a0warned\u00a0voters in a tweet on Saturday to not listen to the president, who directed North Carolinians in a tweet to vote early and to go to their polling places to ensure their ballot was counted and to vote again if it wasn't. Stein countered the president's message with his own thread of tweets. \"To make sure your ballot COUNTS, sign and send it in EARLY. Then track it ONLINE with BALLOTTRAX. Do NOT vote twice (it's a felony), or waste your time, or unnecessarily risk exposure to more people,\" Stein\u00a0said\u00a0in a tweet. \"The only GOOD thing about the President's tweet is that he FINALLY encourages voters to VOTE BY MAIL. It's an easy, safe & secure way to cast a ballot.\" As CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0Saturday, Twitter\u00a0placed\u00a0a public interest notice on the president's tweet from Saturday, citing that it violated Twitter's Civic Integrity Policy, specifically for encouraging people to potentially vote twice. As previously\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Mitchell, the North Carolina State Board of Elections warned voters in a statement earlier this month that it is a felony for North Carolinians to vote twice in an election, after the president suggested voters \"test\" the mail-in voting system by purposefully attempting to vote-by-mail and in-person during a visit to the state earlier this month. The Ohio Controlling Board voted to deny a request from state Secretary of State Frank LaRose to provide postage paid on absentee ballot envelopes for the November general election. During the controlling board meeting, LaRose said he believed he had the legal authority to implement postage paid for this election, but argued that he needed the spending authority from the controlling board to provide first class postage to Ohio's county boards of elections.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports LaRose's proposal included $3 million from his budget to carry out the request. During the hearing, LaRose argued that providing paid postage \"incentivizes getting the ballots back quickly\" and he added that if the controlling board authorized his request on Monday, his office could logistically provide first class postage stamps to its county boards of elections. Absentee ballots will be mailed out to voters who requested them on October 6, which is the first day of early voting in the state. In a statement, LaRose said the controlling board's decision was a \"missed opportunity\" for Ohioans. \"Ohio has a sound elections system, but today was another missed opportunity by the legislature to make a small change, without an impact on our state budget, that would yield a big improvement,\" he said. Democrats in the state legislature were quick to respond to the decision, criticizing Republican state legislators for failing to act. \"Republicans have repeatedly made it clear that they are not interested in making this general election as accessible as possible during a pandemic,\" Ohio House Minority Leader Emilia Strong Sykes said in a statement. The National Republican Congressional Committee announced sixteen new candidates on their \"Young Guns\" program, the highest level of the committee's program to support challengers.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that seven of their challengers are running against House Democrat incumbents in districts Mr. Trump won, while five of them are in open seats due to resignations or incumbents being upset in the primary process. A couple of these open seat candidates are facing competitive races this November, such as Dr. Rich McCormick in Georgia's 7th and Bob Good in Virginia's 5th. For Democrats, Biden threw his support behind a group of House challengers this weekend and Monday. A good amount of them are candidates in the Midwest: Hillary Scholten in Michigan's 3rd, Kate Schroder in Ohio's 1st, Desiree Tims in Ohio's 10th and Betsy Dirksen Londrigan in Illinois' 13th. Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax has officially jumped into the governor's race. He held a pair of announcement events over the weekend in the cities of Fairfax and Hampton. A spokesperson told\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0he filed his candidacy paperwork last Friday. Fairfax, who aspires to become the Commonwealth's second Black governor, joins a growing Democratic field that includes two other African-American candidates - State Senator Jennifer McClellan and Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy. Former Governor Terry McAuliffe has also hinted at a possible run for his old job. Fairfax still faces unresolved sexual assault allegations that came to light following the Blackface scandal that enveloped Governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring in 2019. An attorney for one of Fairfax's accusers, Dr. Vanessa Tyson, renewed calls for the Virginia Legislature to hold a public hearing to allow Tyson and a second accuser, Meredith Watson, to testify. \"It is imperative that these women be given the opportunity to speak the truth publicly,\" said Tyson's lawyer Deborah Katz. \"This type of transparency is critical to ensure accountability - especially now that Mr. Fairfax seeks to be governor.\" Fairfax has denied the decades-old accusations and requested an investigation. He sued CBS News for defamation following an interview with Tyson and Watson conducted by\u00a0CBS This Morning's Gayle King. A judge dismissed the suit earlier this year. Fairfax filed an appeal in July.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans exceeded Election Day expectations, knocking off at least five targeted incumbent  Democrats in 2020. While Democrats will maintain a slimmer majority in the House, CBS News projects Democrats are still likely to lose several more races, including two in Florida.\u00a0 Both parties anticipated that the political environment going into Tuesday's election would expand the House Democratic majority and predicted gains ranging from 5 to 18 seats. But from Miami to New Mexico to Des Moines, Republican congressional candidates outperformed polls and pundits that predicted another \"blue wave\" that would keep even the most vulnerable House Democrats afloat.\u00a0 \"We lost members who shouldn't have lost,\" Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger said on a Thursday call with the Democratic caucus, first  reported by The Washington Post. \"Tuesday, from a congressional standpoint, was a failure.\" CBS News has her leading by over a percentage point with  96% of the vote in. Her opponent Republican Nick Freitas has not yet conceded. Democrats and Republicans have different theories for their pre-election miscalculations. Some wondered if Trump voters hid their alliances from pollsters and then turned out  in high numbers on Election Day. Consistent Republican attack ads on Democrats on socialism and the \"defund the police\" movement seemed to take a toll on Democrats.\u00a0 COVID-19 likely cost Democrats, too, when they chose to eschew in-person canvassing for much of the campaign season for safety reasons, while Republicans did not. The GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund allocated $10 million towards a \"ballot chase\" program and more on-the-ground field operations.\u00a0 Democrats' assessments of districts they thought were in reach may simply have been wrong. And the lack of a third pandemic relief package or the unpopularity of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among Republicans, independents and progressives may also have hurt some candidates.\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had designated at least 47\u00a0open seats or Republican incumbents\u00a0to flip this cycle and grow their caucus. But by Friday, they had picked up just three of those targets. In Texas, which they  often referred to as \"Ground Zero\" for their potential pickups, Democrats are set to lose all ten of their targeted seats.\u00a0 Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, the Chair of the DCCC, argued on a post-election call with the House Democrat caucus their offensive battlefield forced Republicans to play more defense. But she said she was \"furious\" with the results and said the committee would be doing a \"deep dive\" into what happened. She added that \"something went wrong here across the entire political world,\" and she placed much of the blame on faulty polling. \"Our polls, Senate polls, [Governor] polls, Presidential polls, Republican polls, public polls, turnout modeling and prognosticators all pointed to one political environment \u2013 that environment never materialized,\" she said according to a source familiar with the call. Other House strategists said they'd be doing their own audit on the polling in the coming weeks.\u00a0 \"House Democrats failed to recognize that their socialist agenda is completely out of touch with middle class voters. They scoffed at the reality that they could do any wrong,\" said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Michael McAdams about the DCCC's targeting. He also attributed the wins to the turnout Trump brings at the top of the ticket, as well as a record amount of GOP women and minority recruits. Republicans may still pick up more seats, though some competitive races are still too close to call or are waiting for absentee ballots to be counted, including two in New York and four in California. The GOP could still be looking at life in the House minority under a potential Biden-Harris administration, but that gap between the two parties may even drop into single digits. \"I'm not going to lie and say that people aren't sad and devastated,\" said Pennsylvania Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan, a freshman member who is close to several of the Democrats who lost their seats. \"But I think that we all need to take solace in the fact that we retained the House and that it looks like that we'll have a historic victory with the vice president. We have to take solace in that and know that each one of us has played a role in that.\" But Democrats are still holding onto their majority, a point made by House Speaker Pelosi on Friday. \"We did not win every battle in the House, but we won the war,\" she said at a press conference. \"This is not a zero-sum game, somebody's success here is not taking away from your success there.\" Pelosi also sent a letter to colleagues on Friday asking for their support in her reelection for Speaker of the House. California Congressman Ami Bera, who helped lead the DCCC's program for vulnerable members, said there needs to be an unblinking \"360-degree\" look at what messages employed by Republicans ended up being effective if Democrats want to stay in the majority after 2022. He said \"defunding the police\" could have damaged vulnerable Democrats, and that the caucus could have talked about its platform as one of reforming \u2014 rather than defunding \u2014 the police more effectively.\u00a0 \"'That's what most of us mean,\" he told CBS News. \"But there might be pockets of the caucus that use that language [of defunding the police]. We've got to have a conversation that if you use that language, it might make a good sound bite, but it might put some of your colleagues in a tougher position to get re-elected and it's not going to help us hold onto the majority.\" Republicans needed to achieve a net gain of 17 seats to flip the chamber and are currently on track to see a net gain of at least three seats according to CBS News race calls. After recent redistricting created more Democratic districts, Democrats easily flipped North Carolina's 2nd and 6th Districts. They're also about to pick up Georgia's 7th District in the diversifying Atlanta suburbs, a district they lost by 433 votes in 2018.\u00a0 The GOP saw success in several targeted districts that President Trump won in 2016, as well as in traditionally Democratic areas. Their first flips of the night were in Florida's 26th and 27th Districts in South Florida. Republicans Carlos Gimenez, the Mayor of Miami-Dade County, and Maria Elvira Salazar were able to unseat freshmen Democrats Debbie Murcarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala. The Associated Press has called these races, and the latest CBS News data shows both Republicans leading with virtually all ballots in.\u00a0 Salazar, a former Spanish television newscaster, persistently tied Shalala and Democrats to socialism during the campaign and even in her winning remarks. Republicans say the anti-Socialism message resonates with Cuban-Americans in South Florida, a group that also helped Trump surpass his 2016 margins in the state.\u00a0 \"I will not cower to the mob and when faced with the so-called democratic socialists,\" she said on election night.\u00a0 Linking Democrats to socialism and the Green New Deal was a tactic employed by Republican House organizations in districts throughout the campaign. They utilized the \"Defund the Police\" movement to\u00a0 claim Democrats supported it and to warn that it would only lead to more crime. David McIntosh, a former Indiana Congressman and current president of the fiscally conservative Club for Growth PAC, said the South Florida swings \"were incredible.\"\u00a0 \"We actually didn't think it'd be possible, it's a heavy Democrat base,\" he said. \"People voted for Trump, but they also voted for the agenda: rejection of socialism, for growing the economy, for limited government.\" Republican challengers like Stephanie Bice in Oklahoma and Iowa's Ashley Hinson also played up bipartisan inclinations heading into the final weeks of the campaign.\u00a0 Nebraska GOP Congressman Don Bacon, who won his metropolitan Omaha seat despite Joe Biden's victory in the district, also used this approach. He prevailed in his rematch with Democrat Kara Eastman, a Democrat who had the backing of both establishment and progressive Democrats. He distilled his winning message into \"I've delivered bipartisan results,\" and \"my opponent is a Bernie Sanders Democrat.\"\u00a0 \"And I thought if I could make that stick in the voter's mind, I would win,\" he said.\u00a0 He did.\u00a0 Kimberly Brown contributed to this report Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris projected optimism and called for unity in dual speeches on Saturday night, signaling a significant change in tone from the grievance politics of the Trump era. This was the first time the two spoke in public since they were projected to\u00a0win the presidential election.\u00a0 \"The people of this nation have spoken. They have delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for 'we the people.' We won with the most votes ever cast in the history of our nation,\" Biden said, referring to the more than 74 million votes he had earned as of Saturday evening. CBS News projected this morning\u00a0that Biden will win the state of Pennsylvania, bringing him to 273 electoral votes \u2014 just over the 270 threshold needed. A few hours later, CBS News also projected a Biden win in Nevada, boosting his electoral vote total to 279. Biden struck a familiar chord in his speech, calling for unity and implicitly rebuking the president for his divisive politics. \"I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, to make America respected around the world again, and to unite us here at home,\" Biden said. Biden thanked his supporters, boasting that he had earned votes from the \"broadest and most diverse coalition in American history.\" He thanked Black voters in particular for their longtime support. \"You've always had my back. And I'll have yours,\" Biden told Black voters. He also reached out to Trump voters, saying that he would act as their president as much as he would for those who voted for him. \"I understand your disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance,\" Biden said. \"This is the time to heal in America.\" Biden condemned the president without naming him, saying that he wanted to end \"this grim era of demonization in America here and now.\" He also appealed to Republicans in Congress, urging them to work with his incoming administration, saying that Americans had given Biden and Congress a \"mandate\" to \"cooperate in their interest.\" \"This is the United States of America, and there has never been anything we've not been able to do when we've done it together,\" Biden said. He ended his speech by urging supporters to \"spread the faith,\" proclaiming a hopeful message for the next four years. The election of Biden and Harris is historic in more than one way. Biden will be the oldest president to take office and only the second Catholic.\u00a0Harris will be\u00a0the first woman and the first Black American and Asian American to serve as vice president. Biden thanked Harris in his speech and acknowledged the significance of her election. \"Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States! It's long overdue,\" Biden said of Harris becoming the first Black woman vice president. Biden was introduced by Harris, who spoke before him. She was dressed entirely in white, a color traditionally worn by women honoring the suffragist movement. She took the stage to cheers and honking from attendees at the drive-in rally. She began her speech by honoring the late Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights icon whose home state, Georgia, appears to be leaning to Biden. \"Democracy is not a state. It is an act,\" Harris said, quoting Lewis. She continued in her own words: \"Protecting our democracy takes struggle, it takes sacrifice. But there is joy in it, and there is progress. Because we the people have the power to build a better future.\" Harris thanked supporters for their activism throughout the four years of the Trump presidency, and for turning out to vote, by absentee ballot or in person. \"You delivered a clear message. You chose hope and unity, decency, science, and yes, truth,\" Harris said. \"You chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America.\" Harris reflected on the legacy of her mother, who emigrated from India, and the hard work of generations of women to achieve equal rights. \"I am thinking about her, and about the generations of women \u2014 Black women, Asian, White, Latina, Native American women \u2014 who throughout our nation's history have paved the way for this moment tonight,\" Harris said. \"I stand on their shoulders.\" Harris also looked to the future, and the next generation of women leaders. \"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\" Harris said. \"Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\" She spoke about the priorities for the new administration, such as responding to the coronavirus pandemic, addressing climate change and working towards racial justice. \"The road ahead will not be easy, but America is ready, and so are Joe and I,\" Harris said. Biden also announced that he would establish an advisory panel of public health experts to provide guidance on how he should respond to the pandemic. President Trump has not conceded the race, and said in a statement the election was \"far from over.\" His campaign has launched lawsuits in several states in an attempt to delay the counting of votes it considers to be disputed, but this litigation has thus far been unsuccessful. The president spent part of his Saturday golfing at his club in Virginia. Biden's path to victory led through three states Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden also holds a razor-thin lead in Georgia, which is headed for a recount. Mr. Trump captured several large battleground states that Biden had hoped to be competitive in, including Florida, Ohio and Texas. At 78, Biden will be the oldest man to ever occupy the Oval Office. On November 3, Biden was the same age \u2014 77 years, 11 months, 14 days \u2014 as Ronald Reagan was the day he left office.\u00a0 CBS News' projection that Biden has won the presidency comes\u00a048 years \u2014 to the day\u00a0\u2014 after he first won election to the Senate on November 7, 1972. Biden was just 29 years old when he won his seat in Delaware, and would serve for 36 years before becoming vice president in the\u00a0Obama\u00a0administration.

            "article_content": "From Wisconsin to Arizona, as in much of the country, these final weeks of the campaign look to be about who actually votes, because voters say they've made their choices, and many have made it official. Mail ballot returns are pouring in, and almost all remaining voters say they're locked into their decisions anyway.\u00a0 The coronavirus outbreak continues to shape the election in these states. Wisconsin is now going through another rise in cases, and Arizona was hard-hit earlier this year. It's particularly related to the views of those voting for Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who note it as a big reason they're picking him over President Trump and believe he would handle the outbreak better. Biden is cutting into the president's 2016 support levels with key groups like seniors, men and White, non-college voters, helping to push him to a 5-point lead in Wisconsin, and a 3-point lead in Arizona. Another way the coronavirus outbreak is shaping this election is\u00a0the manner in which\u00a0people are voting. In Wisconsin, many voters are switching over to mail ballots, and those doing so cite coronavirus concerns as the main reason.\u00a0 Biden leads with those who've voted already in these critical states, setting up what could be an Election Day make-or-break turnout moment for the president and his supporters. Arizona and Wisconsin have older electorates who tend to vote Republican, and Mr. Trump is underperforming with them in Arizona relative to 2016 as Biden cuts into his margins. Mr. Trump's lead among seniors there is half of what it was in 2016. (Margins are an important metric when looking at support in various groups: in some cases, whether a candidate\u00a0\"wins\"\u00a0a group is less important than\u00a0how much\u00a0he or she wins or loses it by.) One reason: Almost half of Arizona seniors say Mr. Trump's response to the outbreak has put seniors and older voters at risk for coronavirus, and 95% of seniors who feel that way are backing Biden.\u00a0 Seniors are roughly split in their support in Wisconsin, as they were four years ago.\u00a0 After being hit hard by the virus over the summer, most Arizona voters now think efforts to contain the outbreak are going well, but the damage to the president's political fortunes may have been done. More voters say his administration has hurt rather than helped their state's efforts to contain the outbreak. This is the case in Wisconsin too, where they are experiencing thousands of new cases a day. Nine in 10 Biden voters say the coronavirus outbreak is a big factor in their decision to vote for him. And Biden has an advantage over Mr. Trump with voters on how each of the candidates handle himself personally. This may not matter to most of the president's supporters, as relatively few cite the way Mr. Trump handles himself personally as a big reason they are backing him. In Wisconsin, a big part of Mr. Trump's winning coalition last time was White voters without college degrees. He still leads with this group, but Biden has cut into that margin. Mr. Trump's vote share with this group is down 10 points from 2016.\u00a0 A majority of these voters, like Wisconsin voters overall, say the president is most concerned about the wealthy and elite, rather than the middle class or poor. Relatively fewer say the same of Biden. Those who say Mr. Trump is most concerned with the wealthy and elite are not voting for him.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has lost ground with White men in Wisconsin. They backed him by more than 20 points four year ago, but he has just a seven-point advantage now. White, non-college-educated men have gone from supporting the president by over 40 points in 2016 to just 15 points as of today. While Mr. Trump still leads among this group, the decrease in his margin is a major reason the state now leans Democratic. But don't think these contests are over \u2014 these aren't exactly huge statewide margins separating the candidates. Lower-turnout scenarios would move Arizona back toward even and Wisconsin, too. Democrats may have the lead in early returned ballots in Wisconsin so far, but Mr. Trump's voters still mostly plan to vote in person on Election Day.\u00a0 For Trump voters, the virus is not as much of a factor in their support for him. It's the economy that ranks as the biggest factor for them and the top reason they are not backing Biden. In Arizona, where evaluations of the state's economy have grown more positive, the president has a three-point edge over Biden on who would better handle the economy. But in Wisconsin \u2014 where the economic outlook is more negative than positive \u2014 Biden has pulled within one point of Mr. Trump on handling this issue. We have been asking voters if their rationale is mainly voting\u00a0for\u00a0their candidate or\u00a0against\u00a0the other one. Throughout the summer and fall, a large portion of Biden's voters have been mainly against Mr. Trump, and that's increasingly true in Arizona \u2014 up to 55% of Biden's voters feel this way now, compared to 47% in September. Women voters are helping Biden in Arizona. Biden has expanded on Hillary Clinton's 2016 margin with women, and he is being boosted by White women with college degrees, as we've seen in other battleground states. White college-educated women went narrowly for Mr. Trump here in 2016 over Clinton, but they are backing Biden now. A large majority of these voters dislike the way Mr. Trump handles himself personally. White college-educated women backing Biden cite the way Mr. Trump handles himself personally as a big factor in their decision not to vote for the president.\u00a0 Finally, we see a little bit of how the campaigns' approaches are resonating, mostly to Biden's advantage: Biden does better among voters looking for politics to be \"calm\" and \"normal\" for the next four years, while Mr. Trump does better among the (far fewer) who want things \"exciting\" and \"shaken up.\"\u00a0 Both camps see the stakes of this election as very high. In yet another sign of how durable views may be, each side is worried about what happens to the country if the\u00a0other\u00a0party wins. Those most motivated to vote their candidates \u2014 and those firmest in their support \u2014 are the ones most likely to have these fears.\u00a0 Trump voters seem to see more common ground with Biden voters than vice versa. Three in 4 Biden voters see their differences with Trump voters as being not just about politics, but also that Trump voters are different kinds of people than they are. Roughly half of Trump voters feel this way about Biden voters. About half think that while their politics differ, they are otherwise alike. And with a record number of voters casting ballots by mail this year, it may take longer in some states to count votes. A majority of voters in each of these states do not expect to know the winner of the presidential election on election night. Voters across partisan lines share this view.

            "article_content": "On the eve of the 2016 election, Donald Trump\u00a0told business leaders in New York that the U.S. economy would grow a robust 3.5% per year if he were elected president and that the nation would add 25 million new jobs in a decade. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in a speech from the White House streamed online by economic clubs around the country that the economy was the strongest on record before the coronavirus pandemic, again promising vigorous economic growth if he is given another four years in office. He also sought to stir up fear about what a victory by Joe Biden and other Democrats would mean for the U.S.\u00a0 \"The policies of the left would unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions,\" Mr. Trump said, claiming that a Democratic win would lead to sharply higher taxes and \"destroy our country.\" \"We will go into depression,\" the president said. Economists do not echo Mr. Trump's prediction of doom. Last month, an economic\u00a0forecast\u00a0from Moody's predicted that Biden's economic plan would result in \"more jobs, a stronger economy and higher incomes for the middle class\" than Trump's. In fact,\u00a0economic growth under Mr. Trump\u00a0has fallen short of what he promised four years ago. Instead of rising 3.5% annually, the country's gross domestic product in the first three years of his term has risen by an average of 2.6%. Battered by the fallout from COVID-19, employers also have cut 10.5 million jobs in the past six months. Even before the pandemic, however, annual job growth never reached 2.5 million and dropped by nearly 200,000 in 2019. On Wednesday Mr. Trump said that the economy was recovering jobs lost during the lockdowns 23 times faster than in the recovery that followed the Great Recession. He also predicted the economy would add 10 million jobs in the first six months of 2021. That pace of hiring would lift employment roughly back to where it was pre-pandemic by the middle next year. Mr. Trump also touted his success on trade, saying he had replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, ended the Transpacific Partnership and negotiated better trade terms with China.\u00a0 \"If I don't get elected \u2026 China will own the United States,\" Mr. Trump said. Notably absent from Mr. Trump's speech was any mention of another round of fiscal stimulus. Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on the need for more government spending to help speed the recovery. \u00a0 In a response to a question after the speech, Mr. Trump said he favors more stimulus money for certain industries, like the airlines. But he said nothing about another round of cash payments to Americans or restarting enhanced unemployment benefits.\u00a0 Last week, Mr. Trump called off talks over a spending bill with Democrats, but on Tuesday he tweeted his support for significant stimulus spending, urging Congress to \"go big or go home.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden's presidential campaign believes November's election will be a \"referendum\" on President Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic and is preparing to spend most of its time wooing voters online in the coming months.\u00a0 In a briefing for reporters on Friday -- the first high-level strategy discussion with the press since Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon took over in mid-March -- senior aides insisted they believe the president's growing unpopularity will sink his chances. \u00a0 \"Presidents get measured by how they are seen in a crisis,\" Biden senior strategist Mike Donilon said. \"He didn't act decisively, what he did was he froze.\"\u00a0 \"The single biggest driver in terms of turnout and enthusiasm is actually going to be the percentage of people who have very favorable, very unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump,\" Donilon added. With the death toll from the virus at more than 80,000 Americans and unemployment creeping towards historic Depression-era levels, Donilon said the Trump administration's public health and economic response is \"not going to be a distant memory because the public has a very clear sense of what happened.\" During the Zoom session, Biden aides said they believe the November contest will focus on all or parts of 17 states. These include those states they say require \"protecting\" \u2014 the Democratic-friendly states of Virginia, Minnesota, Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada; states they are focused on \"winning back\" \u2014 Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Carolina and Florida \u2014 where President Obama found success \u2014 and \"expanding\" the map to include the states of Arizona, Georgia and Texas.\u00a0 Biden's team is also targeting congressional districts that have swung red and blue in varying elections in Maine and Nebraska, two states that divide up electoral college votes based on results in individual House districts. Senior aides forecasted that if Biden can prevail in Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and hold all other states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, then Biden would capture 318 electoral votes, eclipsing the necessary 270 electoral votes to become president. Clinton lost all of these states in 2016, while Mr. Obama won all of these states, except Arizona, in 2012. O'Malley Dillon was especially confident about Biden's chances in Arizona. \"I am bullish about Arizona. Arizona is a battleground state for the first time,\" she said. The Grand Canyon State has voted Republican in recent presidential elections, but the campaign said it believes it can win by driving up turnout among Latino and younger voters and by coordinating closely with Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly, a popular former astronaut who is polling ahead of Republican Sen. Martha McSally and topping her in fundraising.\u00a0 The campaign, in its 64-minute briefing, did not specify a strategy to \"win back\" other states where Clinton lost in 2016, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\u00a0 To turn the perceived map into reality, Donilon said Biden's initial message of fighting for the middle class and drawing a contrast between Biden and\u00a0 Mr. Trump on character has been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 But voters eager to see Biden in real life may have to wait longer even as Mr. Trump has started traveling again to states like Arizona and Pennsylvania. The campaign on Friday declined to offer a timeline for Biden's physical return to the campaign trail.\u00a0 \"There is obviously a lot of interest in, you know, his location but he is fundamentally showing up where voters are and engaging with them every single day,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"First and foremost, the most important thing for us and for the campaign is public safety.\" She assured reporters that appropriate measures to ensure everyone's safety would be taken by Biden and the large staff and Secret Service contingent that comes with a presidential campaign. Asked whether there are plans to test Biden for COVID-19 -- as the candidate mentioned briefly earlier this week -- senior staffers said there was no current plan to test him.\u00a0 O'Malley Dillon debuted plans to have more than 600 field and outreach staff in states by June. She said the campaign's bank account is growing substantially, boosted by the Democratic party's alignment behind Biden,\u00a0 and now has $103 million cash on hand.\u00a0 Asked by a reporter if the Biden campaign believes the Trump campaign has anything to do with the expanded allegations of sexual assault from Tara Reade, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said, \"The short answer on that is no.\" \"We are not questioning her motive and [Biden] has addressed this unequivocally,\" she added. Biden denies the allegations. Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden's presidential campaign announced Thursday it is launching a five-week, $15 million advertising blitz in six battleground states, its first major advertising effort for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of the general election. According to the campaign, the television and digital ads will run in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona \u2014 all states won by President Trump in 2016. There will also be a national cable component including Fox News.\u00a0 On Thursday, the Biden campaign released three ads that are at the center of its paid media effort. In one spot, \"Unite Us,\" Biden's voice can be heard saying Americans are suffering. \"The country is crying out for leadership, leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together. That's what the presidency is, the duty to care,\" he says. Images of a hospital hallway, then an abandoned factory appear. The ad also shows recent footage of Biden wearing a mask, which Mr. Trump refuses to do in public. In the ad, the former vice president vows he will not traffic in fear and division and will \"seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country.\" The source of the audio is Biden's Philadelphia\u00a0address on the country's need for leadership, delivered in the wake of the death of George Floyd, Biden for President director of paid media Patrick Bonsignore noted in a statement. \"It was an address that Donald Trump could never give,\" Bonsignore said. In another one-minute ad titled \"My Commitment,\" Biden says that \"this moment has come to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many because the because if it weren't clear before, it's clear now: This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs \u2014 it was built by the great American middle class.\" He goes on to list essential workers, saying, \"We need to do more than praise them \u2014 we need to pay them.\" \u00a0 As part of its investment, the Biden campaign will also be placing both English and Spanish-language content across Florida and in Arizona, which the Biden campaign hopes will show \"the thoughtfulness and seriousness\" of its outreach to the Latino community.\u00a0 At the same time, starting Friday, the campaign is also be making a six-figure investment in African-American print, radio, and targeted digital programming in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, an effort that coincides with the celebration of Juneteenth.\u00a0 The eight-figure spending announcement comes after the Biden campaign announced that along with the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committee, it raised more than $80 million in May,\u00a0the most the campaign has raised so far in the 2020 election cycle. The New York Times first reported the campaign's new ad spending. The ad expenditures come after a lengthy period without ads \u2014 Biden's campaign has not aired spots on TV or radio since early March, while he still faced opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination. According to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group tracking, Biden's campaign spent just over $20 million in total on television and radio ads across the primary season.\u00a0 Over the past three months, President Trump's campaign has been on the defensive since the coronavirus pandemic began, spending upwards of $25 million on television ads since early March including in the battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina, as well as Arizona, Ohio and Iowa.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has officially launched his campaign to reclaim his old seat, entering a Democratic primary field of progressive Black candidates.\u00a0 As he stood in front of Miles Jones Elementary School in Richmond, McAuliffe vowed to take progressive action on education in the aftermath of the coronavirus, which has changed the way children are learning and likely negatively impacted their academic progress. He proposed a $2 billion investment to boost education and teacher salaries, expand pre-school education access and \"ensure every single student is online.\"\u00a0 \"To build a strong post-COVID economy, the best workforce in the world to create a clear path for the middle class, we need to make an unprecedented investment in education,\" McAuliffe said, adding the proposal is the first of several to address life after coronavirus.\u00a0 McAuliffe previously served as the commonwealth's governor from 2014 to 2018 and left with high approval ratings. Virginia law prevents governors from serving consecutive four-year terms, but does allow them to run again after serving one term.\u00a0 He enters the race as the best-known candidate and a strong fundraiser \u2014 his \"Common Good VA PAC\" has raised $2.82 million since 2019 according to the Virginia Public Access Project.\u00a0 Former State Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy, State Senator Jennifer McClellan and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax all declared for the primary earlier this year and have been focusing on grassroots support and racking up local endorsements. State Senator Lee J. Carter, a self-dubbed Democratic socialist, also filed paperwork this week to enter the race.\u00a0 Foy and McClellan are both aiming to become the state's, and the nation's, first black woman governor. Foy was the first to respond to McAuliffe's campaign announcement, calling him a \"career politician\" who is interested \"in maintaining the status quo.\"\u00a0 \"While I respect Terry McAuliffe's service, he doesn't understand the problems Virginians face. A former political party boss and multi-millionaire, Terry McAuliffe is simply out of touch with everyday Virginians,\" she said in a statement released Tuesday night.\u00a0 McClellan added on Tuesday that she welcomes McAuliffe to the race, and said she looks forward to discussing her \"15 years of experience delivering progressive change and my vision for the future with Virginians in the months to come.\"\u00a0 McAuliffe's campaign co-chairs praised his actions as governor, saying his work helped lead to progressive actions taken by the Democratic-held legislature. State Senator L. Louise Lucas said McAuliffe has shown a \"track record\" of being responsive to minority communities.\u00a0 \"Anytime our communities have asked him to do something, Terry has delivered,\" she said after his remarks. \"We're standing with him based on what he has done, and what we know he can do. This has nothing to do with race. It has everything to do with who can best represent Virginia and bring us to where we need to be in this 21st century.\" Susan Platt, a former Democratic Lieutenant Governor candidate who is working to elect Foy or McClellan through the \"Her Excellency VA 2021\" group, said while she understands McAuliffe's desire to be governor again, the moment calls for the state to make history and elect the first black woman governor. \"This is not against Terry McAuliffe or any man, for that matter,\" she said. \"I think now we've been presented an opportunity. We have now a woman vice president elect. I think we're at a point in history that was different than a few years ago. And it's time we say we're ready to lead, we want to lead.\" Platt added that a woman statewide candidate could help energize the Democratic base in an off year election. McAuliffe won by less than two points in 2013, though the state has grown to be more Democratic. Current Governor Ralph Northam won by close to 9 points in 2017, while President-elect Joe Biden won the state by 10 points this year. The 2021 gubernatorial race follows a turbulent 2019 for Virginia's Democratic leadership, with Governor Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring weathering \"blackface\" scandals and Fairfax facing sexual assault allegations (which he has denied).\u00a0 Rather than holding a primary, Virginia Republicans recently chose to hold a convention process. As a result, state Senator Amanda Chase has chosen to run as an independent candidate instead. Chase and State Delegate Kirk Cox are the only Republicans to have officially declared a gubernatorial run. Cox has already taken a shot at McAuliffe in a statement, saying he's running only \"because his last presidential campaign collapsed before it started and he needs a platform for his next one.\" \"If his interest in the governorship was about us, the people of Virginia, rather than just about Terry, he would not have had his bags packed after three years, ready to quit on us as governor and go work for President Hillary Clinton,\" Cox said, referencing McAuliffe's close relationship and work with the Clintons. Republicans held both legislative chambers in every year of McAuliffe's tenure except his first. While he said the \"sky is the limit\" in terms of working with a Democratic state House and Senate on issues like criminal justice reform and voter rights, he pitched his work with Republicans as a benefit of his experience.\u00a0 \"I'm not interested in partisan games or the old ways of thinking or doing things,\" McAuliffe said. \"We have a huge opportunity here in Virginia to address the inequities of the past, to move Virginia forward and to create a better future for all Virginians.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Two Supreme Court rulings Thursday\u00a0will permit Manhattan prosecutors to access troves of President Trump's business records and tax returns, but the court has pressed pause on Congress' pursuit,\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn\u00a0and\u00a0campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0report. In a momentous defeat for the president in his efforts to shield his personal financial information from state investigators, the high court\u00a0ruled\u00a07-2 in favor of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. Vance is conducting a criminal investigation into the president's business dealings and hush-money payments made to two women who alleged affairs with the president years before he was elected. Trump-appointed justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined the majority, while Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The justices sent the dispute back to the lower courts. President Trump responded to a question about the decisions Thursday at an event with Hispanic leaders at the White House, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. \u00a0\"Well, the rulings were basically starting all over again, sending everything back down to the lower courts, and you start all over again, so, from a certain point I'm satisfied. From another point, I'm not satisfied, because frankly this is a political witch hunt, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, it's a pure witch hunt, it a hoax, just like the Mueller investigation was a hoax that I won.\" Mr. Trump went on to call the ruling \"purely political\" and said that New York has turned into a \"hellhole.\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, \"Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding. We reaffirm that principle today and hold that the President is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need.\"\u00a0 Vance is seeking business records and tax returns dating to 2011 from Mazars USA, Mr. Trump's longtime accounting firm. But the president and his attorneys had rebuffed Vance's efforts to obtain his financial information, arguing the president has \"absolute immunity\" from state criminal proceedings while in office. The high court, however, rejected Mr. Trump's assertion of absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas. In a statement after the ruling, Vance hailed the decision as \"a tremendous victory for our nation's system of justice and its founding principle that no one \u2014 not even a president \u2014 is above the law.\"\u00a0 Jay Sekulow, the president's personal attorney, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0the legal team \"will now proceed to raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts.\" Mr. Trump promptly\u00a0reacted\u00a0to the court's decision on Twitter, Thursday, calling the outcome \"a political prosecution.\" The president continued to\u00a0tweet, \"Courts in the past have given \"broad deference\". BUT NOT ME!\" Mr. Trump has gone to great lengths to shield his business records and tax returns from public view, mounting legal challenges to subpoenas issued by Vance and a trio of Democrat-led congressional committees for his personal information. Both sets of subpoenas sought disclosures from Mr. Trump's accountants and bankers \u2013 Deutsche Bank and Capital One \u2013 not from Mr. Trump himself. Both firms have signaled their compliance with the high court's ruling. While the president vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign to release his tax returns once an IRS audit was complete, he has not done so, raising questions from his political opponents as to whether the records would shed light on his vast business dealings. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN After a short tour at a stair manufacturing factory outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joe Biden took off his new N95 mask and debuted his manufacturing plan,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \"Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. After 3.5 years of big promises what do the American people have to show for all of the talk?\" Biden pitched his \"Build Back Better\" plan to increase jobs and assist the middle class. With the pandemic impacting so many families, Biden accused the president of using the strife to his advantage.\u00a0 \"Donald Trump may believe pitting Americans versus Americans may benefit him. I don't,\" Biden said. He ticked through investments of hundreds of billions of dollars into American-made products and research and development to compete with China. Biden offered no overall price tag for the plan but claimed at least 5 million additional jobs would be produced. He also reiterated that he'd return the corporate income tax rate to 28% and added a warning shot to Amazon that the days of them \"paying nothing\u2026will be over.\" Throughout the speech, Biden briefly accused the president of defending the Confederate flag and directing federal PPP loans to big business instead of small \"mom and pop\" businesses, taking specific issue with individual chain restaurants receiving pandemic-relief loans. Biden's more protectionist plan has been complimented by supporters of progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and is a stark departure from Biden's economic voting record, as he voted in favor of NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreements which his primary rivals said cost America thousands of jobs. TRUMP CAMPAIGN Vice President Mike Pence, campaigning in Pennsylvania, focused on the country's economic recovery amid a public health pandemic and said the choice for voters this election cycle has never been clearer.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says Pence promised voters will be \"hearing a lot about the future and a lot about the choice\" they will make at the polls this November. \"It is a choice between continuing to grow and strengthen the American economy,\" Pence said, \"versus more taxes, more government, more regulation and the kind of economic stagnation that that's always brought.\" Pence spent Thursday on a bus tour from Lancaster to Philadelphia. At a roundtable on re-opening the economy in Malvern, Pence talked about the differences between President Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. \"Where President Trump unleashed American energy, we know that under Joe Biden the war on coal would be back,\" Pence said. \"Joe Biden not long ago said that coal miners needed to 'learn to code,'\" Pence added. He said going forward, President Trump will build on the momentum from the administration's first term. \"We think 2021 could be one the greatest years in the history of the American economy,\" Pence projected. \"But it is all going to be the choice the American people make.\" Biden was also campaigning in Pennsylvania \u2013 just a couple of hours north of Malvern in Dunmore, a point Pence acknowledged, saying, \"I know Joe Biden is down the road talking about raising taxes.\" He added, \"President Trump wants to put money in the pockets of working Americans\" and said Mr. Trump is also open to another round of direct stimulus checks to support Americans. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says Lancaster County, where Pence began his day, was the largest county President Trump won in Pennsylvania in 2016. A 20-point lead there gave him 137,145 votes, the fourth most from any county in the state. Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania by roughly 44,000 votes out of more than 6 million cast in the state, the narrowest margin in a presidential election for that state in 176 years.\u00a0 But as the population of the longtime Republican stronghold has grown, it has become more Democratic. Over the past 20 years, the Democratic electorate in the county has grown 62%, while registered Republicans have grown under 2%.In Chester County, where Pence met with business leaders at Rajant Corporation, Barack Obama was the first Democrat to lead a presidential race since Lyndon Johnson. Although Mitt Romney won Chester by a narrow margin in 2012, Democrats added over 26,000 votes in 2016, and Trump lost to Clinton there by nearly 10 points. Nearly\u00a074,000\u00a0Chester Democrats voted in the June primary, a 23% boost from\u00a02016, while 40% fewer Republicans turned out, although the latter could be due to that primary being uncontested.\u00a0 According to pool reports, as part of routine testing of those who may be in contact with the vice president at his roundtable at Rajant Corporation, two people tested positive for the coronavirus. Both people were not permitted into the event space and areas where they may have had contact were disinfected. This happened hours before Pence arrived at the location. Before the roundtable, Pence had lunch with 150 supporters at a fundraiser that brought in $1 million. After the discussion on re-opening of the economy, Pence continued his bus tour to Philadelphia, where he delivered remarks to law enforcement officers. VEEPSTAKES KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS The Atlanta Mayor, late Wednesday night, issued an executive order requiring all people within the city to wear a mask, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry.\u00a0 \"The governor is not doing enough for the state and his leadership has been irresponsible,\" Bottoms said in an interview Thursday morning.\u00a0 \"We have to continue to take responsibility for ourselves because there is a lack of leadership in our state and there's a lack of leadership from the White House. And unfortunately, our governor and the president are on the same page.\"\u00a0 The executive order does not specify how this mandate will be enforced. Bottoms said she is following the examples of other mayors throughout the state who have issued similar orders. CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES TOURISM IN COLORADO CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents in the biggest 2020 battleground states amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. In the latest report,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0examines\u00a0tourism in Colorado. According to\u00a0Colorado's Tourism Office, the state is home to only 1.7% of the U.S. population, but accounts for 7.7% of the country's tourism jobs. Many of those jobs are seasonal, and employees looking to secure winter work are wondering what the season will look like when so much is uncertain. Another looming question \u2014 will international visitors be allowed to enter the U.S.?\u00a0CTO\u00a0data shows overseas travelers bring more value into the state than domestic travelers, spending an average $2,438 per person per trip in 2018 versus $775 per person for visitors from Mexico and Canada. Another challenge: employers are finding it hard to hire as many workers who are now making more on unemployment. Changing seasons usually brings different opportunities in Colorado, but amid COVID it might bring more headaches.\u00a0 CONVENTIONAL WISDOM GOP GUEST LIST Three more senators responded to questions about whether or not they're planning to attend the Republican National Convention in Florida in August, report\u00a0CBS News Capitol Hill producer Alan He\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas told reporters that he probably won't attend. CBS News has\u00a0previously confirmed\u00a0at least five GOP senators do not plan to attend. Senator Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin hedged on whether they'll be there. \"I think the convention is a challenging situation and a number of my colleagues have announced that they're not going to attend,\" Leader McConnell said. \"We'll have to wait and see how things look in late August to determine whether or not you can safely convene that many people.\" PARTY PLANNING The 2020 Jacksonville Host Committee for the Republican National Convention held a vendor showcase at a local convention center in Jacksonville Thursday, where businesses pitched their services to the host committee for a chance to serve as vendors for the national convention in August. According to a local\u00a0report\u00a0by the Jacksonville Daily Record, the host committee invited some of the 1,000 applicants that the committee says applied to participate in the showcase, and the nearly 77 business owners who attended included caterers, bakeries, florists, event planners and breweries. The vendor showcase comes amid a Washington Post\u00a0report\u00a0that the GOP convention could be moved to an outdoor stadium according to some officials.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that during a press conference Thursday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said it was his understanding that an outdoor convention was always an option and that the convention will be a safe environment because \"safety is non-negotiable.\" DeSantis said, \"I think you look at some place like the Daily's\u2026especially with Florida weather\u2026I think you could do that in a way that'd be very safe. So I think the outside would be a really good idea.\" \u00a0 He continued, \"Delegates\u2026need to be comfortable going into those places, and I think that they will be if you're able to do it...\" As previously\u00a0reported\u00a0by CBS News, the RNC has not disclosed how many attendees the party is planning to host in Jacksonville, but convention officials have said that attendees will be tested and have their temperatures checked daily. Daily's Place amphitheater, mentioned by DeSantis during the press conference Thursday, seats 5,500 people according to its website.\u00a0 Mitchell\u00a0adds that as planning for the Jacksonville convention proceeds, the state added more than 8,000 new COVID-19 cases to its total count Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases to 232,718. For the 4th time in two weeks, the number of daily cases and testing decreased as the positivity rate increased according to\u00a0data\u00a0provided by the Florida Department of Health. ISSUES THAT MATTER JOBS The coronavirus pandemic continues to keep millions of Americans out of work, with more than 2.3 million workers filing jobless claims last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday. There were 1.3 million claims from traditional initial claims and another one million people filed claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which is for self-employed and gig workers, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. While the number of jobless claims has dropped from the peak of close to 7 million in late March and early April, this was the 16th straight week where at least 2 million workers claimed unemployment, when data from the two programs is combined.\u00a0 For the week ending June 20, the Labor Department said nearly 33 million people received unemployment benefits, up 1.4 million from the previous week. The news comes a week after the June jobs report showed that real unemployment dropped from 16% to 12%. Economists warned that that wasn't an accurate picture because the survey was completed before a resurgence in coronavirus cases forced many states to tighten regulations on businesses. SENIOR CITIZENS An\u00a0investigation by a local Pennsylvania outlet\u00a0challenged the data House Republicans have used to attack Democratic governors and their handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes. In June, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana\u00a0led an effort\u00a0focused on governors and attorneys general in New York, Michigan, California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Scalise and GOP members from the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis claimed governors defied federal guidelines by allowing individuals who tested positive to be admitted into nursing homes, regardless of their ability to meet CDC guidelines.\u00a0 Governors and their state health officials\u00a0denied the accusations. Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said in a June news conference \"there is no evidence\" that Governor Tom Wolf's policy \"itself contributed to that many deaths.\" In a\u00a0press conference\u00a0with Pennsylvania Congressman Scott Perry, Scalise and Perry proposed an alternative approach, creating separate COVID-19 facilities for those discharged from the hospital. This was an approach taken by governors from both parties in Connecticut and Massachusetts, two states that had higher COVID-19 cases than the five states that received letters from House Republicans, as\u00a0the Sentinel reported.\u00a0Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican, and state officials\u00a0backtracked from this approach in April\u00a0following an uproar about relocating nursing home residents, and three volunteer facilities reporting positive cases before relocation.\u00a0 In Connecticut, some nursing homes are still being used to provide care for COVID-19 patients. First Selectman Brent Colley, who oversaw a health care center that relocated and housed residents, was an outspoken\u00a0critic of this relocating policy when announced.\u00a0He told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0while the community has come together to help the center out and keep the spread lower, \"when you relocate someone no matter what, they're going to have issues\u2026there's so many variables.\" \"It is clear based on the mass number of fatalities nationwide \u2013 over 40% from nursing homes \u2013 that every state has suffered these horrible deaths. But not every states had a strict \"must admit\" order like NY, NJ, MI, PA, and CA. We must determine why these orders were made and what consequences they had,\" a Republican committee spokesman said.\u00a0 LEGAL MATTERS SCOTUS REAX In the wake of the Supreme Court decision,\u00a0CBS News political unit intern Isabella Laufer\u00a0reports that Democrats took to Twitter to voice their approval of the decision. Mr. Biden reposted a video from October of 2019, where he criticized President Trump's failure to release tax returns, saying, \"Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up.\" In his repost Biden wrote, \"As I was saying.\" While they recognize that the release of the tax returns will likely take awhile, Democrats largely viewed the decision as a long-term victory. \"The Supreme Court reaffirmed today what everyone but Donald Trump already knew: nobody is above the law \u2013 not even the President of the United States,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for Biden's VP pick,\u00a0tweeted. Other former 2020 presidential candidates reacted, praising the decision. Senator Kamala Harris called it \"a major win.\"\u00a0Senator Amy Klobuchar,\u00a0Tom Steyer\u00a0and\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0all tweeted that no one, even Trump, \"is above the law.\" Congresswoman Karen Bass, also under consideration for Biden's running mate, agreed and\u00a0tweeted, \"The President of the United States is not above the law.\" Republican representative Rep. Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, claimed Democrats were politicizing the issue.\u00a0 \"Today's decisions by the Supreme Court sadly will not end the Democrats' partisan obsession,\" he said in a statement. \"Americans around the country deserve better than the Democrats' never-ending political games.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also defended the president. \"I've watched President Trump abide by all the requests that someone has for financial disclosure. They are much more thorough than any tax returns. It seems to me the New York district attorney and others that have tried for it seem much more political than anything else,\" he said. STATE-BY-STATE FLORIDA The Florida Democratic Party has announced that it will return funds it received from the Paycheck Protection Program after fielding criticism from Democratic and Republican leaders this week.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that according to information released by the Small Business Administration, the Florida Democratic Party Building Fund was approved to receive between $350,000 to $1 million in PPP funds in April. As CBS News has previously\u00a0reported, small minority-owned businesses in Florida are still recovering from the economic hit the pandemic has taken on their businesses. \"Congress passed the Paycheck Protection Plan to support employers and their efforts to provide funds to keep people working \u2014 and like many employers during the shutdown, FDP was concerned about meeting payroll and keeping our staff employed, so we applied,\" said FDP spokesperson Luisana P\u00e9rez Fern\u00e1ndez in a statement. \"The bank, the loan processor and agents of the Small Business Association approved the funding. It now seems they made a mistake in approving the funding so we are volunteering to return it.\" A spokesperson for the Republican Party of Florida told CBS News that it did not receive PPP funds amid the pandemic. \"In May, Florida Democrats chastised President Trump's Paycheck Protection Program.\u00a0 But it certainly didn't stop them from filing an application, when rules clearly state an organization like a political party were prohibited from receiving PPP. Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo and her team not only submitted an application, but they gladly accepted money from the program,\" said RPOF Chairman Joe Gruters in a statement. \"This certainly raises many questions and it is becoming very clear that the FDP should never have attempted to apply for the PPP funds in the first place.\" NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper announced at a press conference Thursday that the state's Department of Health and Human Services will send up to 250 community health workers to areas throughout the state that have experienced high numbers of COVID-19 cases. The health workers will be responsible for connecting residents to \"social support resources,\" which include testing information, mental health services, and helping individuals find a location to safely isolate if they test positive for COVID-19. This comes as North Carolina reports more than 79,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 1,000 hospitalizations throughout the state.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has also announced that the state dispatched 100 contract nurses to Miami-Dade, 100 nurses to the Tampa Bay area and will be bringing in \"many more hundreds\" to help mitigate the spike in COVID-19 cases in the Sunshine State.\u00a0 TEXAS Yesterday, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced his administration would be shutting down next week's in-person state Republican convention for the sake of public safety. Today, the Texas Republican Party announced a lawsuit against the mayor, the city of Houston, and the convention venue for breaking the convention's contract, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. In a statement, the Texas GOP accused the Houston mayor of playing politics. \"Mayor Turner canceled the convention because he wanted to, not due to any 'act of God' \u2013 only due to his desire to do so and to hold the Republican Party of Texas to a different standard than other entities.\"\u00a0 Not only is the state party requesting an injunction, but it is also filing a temporary restraining order to prevent Turner from controlling the fate of the convention. Should the event move forward, it would begin July 16. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE SENATE GEORGIA In one of the Georgia Senate races, both candidates have released their first TV ads of the cycle this week, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Republican Senator David Perdue released\u00a0two ads Wednesday, and Democratic Senate nominee Jon Ossoff released his first ad Thursday morning. In the ad entitled \"We Investigate,\" Ossoff speaks to the camera about his work as an investigative journalist working to root out corruption. \"Fighting corruption is my job, and it's what I'll do as your senator.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball at the UVA Center for Politics changed the rating for this seat Thursday morning from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican.\"",

            "article_content": "The gap between rich and poor in America is the worst it's been in more than a half century. It's a concern cited by every leading Democratic presidential candidate in the 2020 election, but many may not realize what it actually means.  If a pie represented the estimated $98 trillion of household wealth in the United States, nine pieces, or 90% of the pie, would go to the wealthiest 20% in the country, according to a National Bureau Of Economic Research study of household wealth trends in the united states from 1962 to 2016. Out of those nine slices, four would go to just the top 1%.  The upper middle class and the middle class would share one piece, or about 10%, and the lower middle class would get .3% of the pie. The poorest Americans, people in the bottom 20%, wouldn't get any. On average, they are more than $6,000 in debt.  People presented with this image of the country's wealth distribution were surprised.  Beberlee Maldonado said it wasn't what she expected and called it \"disturbing.\" \"It's very sad. It's very depressing,\" Jessica Ortiz told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil, adding that she grew up in the poorest category.  In the 2020 election cycle, Democratic candidates Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have promised to redistribute the pie with a special tax on fortunes $50 million and up.  \"The wealthiest people in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes,\" Sanders said on the campaign trail in May.\u00a0 Polls show most Americans support the idea. Asked if she thinks there should be an extra tax on the super wealthy, Maldonado said, \"Why not? They could afford it.\" \"They should,\" said another woman, Adriane Huff. \"Will it happen? Probably not.\" Not everyone is on board with the tax. \"That's against sorta the American way,\" said John Sheffield at the New York Boat Show. \"It would be a total disaster \u2026 And I'd actually like for them to continue to promote it because they won't get elected in that way.\" Sheffield and Mark Tedford run an investment firm in Connecticut.  \"Wealth redistribution is always popular amongst the masses who don't have the wealth and not popular amongst the 1% that do,\" Tedford said. \"But it doesn't make economic sense to me.\" Asked to explain why, Tedford said, \"I guess the alternative is, do we need a socialist economy where everyone has the same? That doesn't make sense either. A lot of people who have a lot have earned it and made it. \"They've started their own companies, they've grown businesses, they've worked hard, they've gotten good degrees, they've gone to school. They may have had more opportunity than others, but there's a lot of people who just haven't done that.\"",

            "article_content": "Another round of federal stimulus checks could soon be making their way to millions of U.S. taxpayers, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin signaling on Thursday that President Donald Trump is eager to move ahead with the payments.\u00a0 Mnuchin announced Thursday that the White House and Senate Republicans have reached a \"fundamental agreement\" on an opening legislative proposal to provide Americans with additional\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief.\u00a0 While the details aren't yet known, reports suggest that some Republican lawmakers could seek to limit the stimulus checks to lower-income households. Asked about another round of stimulus checks earlier this month, for instance, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted that the people who have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic are those earning less than $40,000 annually.\u00a0 Limiting the checks to people who earn less than that amount, or $80,000 for married couples, would mean millions of middle-class taxpayers wouldn't qualify for the payments. An analysis of IRS data suggests that more than 60 million people, including married couples and single taxpayers, who qualified for the first round of stimulus checks could be excluded from the second round if the next bill reduces the income threshold. Altogether, the IRS has sent out more than 160 million stimulus checks, which the government calls \"economic impact payments.\" Here's what we know so far about a possible second stimulus check.\u00a0 This stems from McConnell's statement at an event in early July saying he's open to more stimulus checks, but noting that he's focused on people who earn less than $40,000 a year.\u00a0 That cap is not certain to survive wrangling on Capitol Hill. When asked about such a limit, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned it. \"I don't know where the $40,000 comes from,\" she said in a July news\u00a0conference. \"The $40,000 would have to be explained, justified and the rest.\" Roughly 165 million married and single taxpayers fell below the income thresholds for the first stimulus checks, IRS data show. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, single taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 and married taxpayers who earn less than $150,000 qualified for the full payments of $1,200 and $2,4000, respectively. Payouts declined incrementally until they phased out entirely for single people with annual income exceeding $98,000 and married couples earning more than $199,000. Setting the income cutoff to qualify for a check at $40,000 for individual taxpayers \u2014 and assuming that would be doubled to roughly $80,000 for married taxpayers \u2014 would reduce the number of Americans eligible for a payment to about 106 million people, or about 60 million fewer people than received the first check.\u00a0 Some economists support a more targeted approach to issuing stimulus checks, noting that higher-income households tend to save the money, especially during uncertain times, while lower-income households spend it, providing a greater boost to the overall economy.\u00a0 \"Lower-income households receive it, they spend it right away,\" said Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi in a conference call earlier this month to discuss the federal response to the recession caused by the coronavirus.\u00a0 Yes. The proposed $3 trillion Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES, Act would authorize another round of stimulus payments for most households. Yet while the bill was passed by the Democrat-controlled House in May, it's unclear whether the Republican-controlled Senate will adopt this measure. The HEROES Act would offer a larger stimulus payment than the CARES Act. The measure calls for each member of a household to receive $1,200, including children. The income thresholds would remain the same as under the CARES Act, meaning that single taxpayers earning less than $75,000 and married taxpayers earning a total of $150,000 would receive the full payments. For instance, a family of four whose parents earn less than $150,000 would receive $4,800. To see how much you would receive under the HEROES Act, you can check this\u00a0stimulus calculator\u00a0from OmniCalculator. Depending on how negotiations go in Washington, new stimulus checks could be issued as early as August. President Trump's \"preference is to make sure we send out direct payments quickly, so that in August, people get more money,\" Mnuchin told CNBC.\u00a0 Mr. Trump told Fox News earlier this month he's in favor of providing a second round of stimulus payments that would be even larger than what the Democrats are proposing. Whatever the amount, it's clear that the White House \u2014 facing a tough re-election bid in November \u2014 favors a substantial payment.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren is ending her presidential campaign after failing to win any primary contests and placing third in her home state of Massachusetts on Super Tuesday. She informed her staff in a conference call Thursday morning before an emotional afternoon press conference outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"I say this with a deep sense of gratitude for every single person who got in this fight,\" Warren told reporters. \"I will not be running for president in 2020, but I guarantee I will stay in the fight for the hardworking folks across this country who've gotten the short end of the stick.\" Her exit from the race clears the way for a head-to-head matchup between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the two candidates who emerged from Super Tuesday atop the delegate race. Warren spoke to Biden on Wednesday, according to a source with knowledge of the conversation. Warren said she needed \"space\" to think about her endorsement, saying she would not make a decision \"right now.\" \"Let's take a deep breath and spend a little time on that,\" Warren said about who her supporters should turn to now that she has dropped out of the race. As the field has essentially narrowed to a two-man race, Warren became emotional as she discussed her disappointment that a woman would not be the nominee. \"One of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years,\" Warren said. She had made a practice of making pinky promises with little girls who attended her campaign events, saying she was running for president \"because that's what girls do.\" Warren also briefly touched upon the impact sexism had on her campaign. \"If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner!' And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bajillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?'\" Warren said. In a call with campaign staff Thursday morning, Warren said her campaign \"has made a lasting difference.\" \"What we have done \u2014 and the ideas we have launched into the world, the way we have fought this fight, the relationships we have built \u2014 will carry through, carry through for the rest of this election, and the one after that, and the one after that,\" Warren said in the call, according to her campaign. The Massachusetts senator proved to be an incisive debater, and her attacks on Michael Bloomberg punctured holes in his argument that he was the most electable candidate against President Trump. Warren had a fervent base, but she failed to gain a diverse coalition of support. Across the Super Tuesday states, exit poll data showed four in 10 Democratic primary voters who backed her identified as \"very liberal,\" similar to the percentage of Sanders supporters who identify that way. Sixty-six percent of her supporters were women, and 82% were white. Sixty-nine percent of Warren supporters had college degrees, including 39% with advanced degrees, making her supporters the most educated of the top candidates. Warren declared her candidacy in January 2019, and worked to distinguish her campaign with her thorough policy plans. However, her support for Medicare for All and assertion that implementing the plan would not include raising taxes on the middle class put off some more moderate Democrats. She finished in third place in the Iowa caucuses, and fell to fourth in New Hampshire, her neighboring state. She initially resisted dropping out of the race after her disappointing showing on Super Tuesday, choosing to talk \"to her team to assess the path forward\" the day after.\u00a0 Her third-place finish in Massachusetts raised questions about how long she could remain as a candidate. Speaking to supporters on Tuesday evening, Warren indicated that she did not plan to drop out. \"My name is Elizabeth Warren, and I'm the woman who's going to beat Donald Trump,\" Warren said in Detroit. She urged voters not to listen to prognostications from pundits, but instead to vote with their hearts. \"Prediction has been a terrible business, and the pundits have gotten it wrong over and over,\" Warren said. In a memo to staff, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau said that the team was \"disappointed in the results.\" \"Last night, we fell well short of viability goals and projections, and we are disappointed in the results. We're still waiting for more results to come in to get a better sense of the final delegate math. And we also all know the race has been extremely volatile in recent weeks and days with frontrunners changing at a pretty rapid pace,\" Lau said in the memo. \"But we are obviously disappointed.\" Several former presidential candidates have endorsed Biden, including Bloomberg, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. Biden picked up wins in Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas, while Sanders won in Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont. Sanders is also currently leading in California as votes continue to be counted. Ed O'Keefe, Zak Hudak and Caitlin Huey-Burns contributed reporting.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS \u2013 DAVID PRIESS Producer: Paulina Smolinski MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0David, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you on the show. I've been wanting to do this for some time.\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0It's a pleasure to join you. Thanks.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0So, David, we're going to chat about how presidential candidates get intelligence and how president elects get their intelligence. But before we do that, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about your career at CIA. And so maybe the place to start is by asking you, how did you end up at the Central Intelligence Agency? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0Yeah, it was a bit of a surprise to me, Michael, because here I was, a graduate student finishing up my PhD at Duke in International Relations with a focus on the Middle East. And I'd done two different trips out there for fieldwork in the previous years. And I thought maybe I don't want to go into teaching at the university level, which a lot of PhD students will do. I wanted to try something in Washington, either a policy or an advocacy job. And at some academic conference, I met a gentleman whose business card said 'Scholar in Residence U.S. government', which I didn't think twice about at the time.\u00a0 And I expressed to him my desire to do something different. And he said let me think about it, give me a copy of your CV and let me think about it. And the next day I got a call from the Central Intelligence Agency, after which I learned, of course, that he was a scholar in residence for the CIA and the process moved relatively quickly. They interviewed me. I got the job, and it went from there.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0When did you start? \u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0That process was in 1997. And I believe I started the very first EOD or entrance on duty class of 1998.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0And walk us through, David, your assignments as an analyst and including your time as a briefer. DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0I worked primarily as an analyst, although I did have a couple of stints working on operational issues, mostly on Middle East and counterterrorist issues, the latter working in the counterterrorist center both before and after September 11th. But probably the best two positions I had in the agency were, number one, as a manager of analysts. I just love the job of developing new analysts, mentoring them, getting them the resources they needed to do things up to and including going down and briefing the president. And I was managing a unit on a major country in the Middle East that had plenty of contact with the president and other senior officials. And that was just a really affirming experience.\u00a0 And then, as you mentioned, a briefer job. I was on the president's daily brief briefing team. I think right around the time you stopped briefing President Bush was when they made the selection that after 9/11, we are going to have a full time, full term PDB briefer for the attorney general and the FBI director. And I was the first person in that job. So for a little more than a year, taking the PDB downtown every day to those two or on the occasional days that both of them head off or we're not taking a briefing. I was a glutton for punishment and would substitute for one of the other briefers who wanted a day off. So that would take me with the PDB into the White House or, or elsewhere.\u00a0 And I have to say, and you've said some things that imply this as well, that there's really no better job at the agency. Because people talk about the paramilitary operations as the tip of the spear of intelligence. But if you think about the overall intelligence enterprise, the tip of the spear really is delivering the best information and insight informed by intelligence sources to the decision makers. And that's really what the PDB briefing job is all about. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0Why did you decide to leave the agency ultimately?\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0A couple of factors, push and pull factors. On the one hand, I was I was doing well and flattered that people were thinking of me in line for a career, probably in the same progression as yours, which is successfully moving into other management positions. But I didn't like that the talk about it had shifted from 'David. What do you want to do.' to 'David here's what we're going to want you to do.' And I had just enough of a millennial streak in me before we had the term millennial that I certainly felt like that doesn't seem like fun. I want to do this, this, and this, which I had been blessed to do in my career. Doing things, including a rotation at the State Department, doing policy for a year that I really wanted to do.\u00a0 The other part of it was the fact that even though it's a very large enterprise with a lot of different things to do, there were certain things I suddenly had an itch to do that would have been harder to do on the inside. One of those is writing books. You and I both know people who, while they were employed at CIA, did write books on their subject matter. That's extraordinarily hard to do.\u00a0 And it would have been more difficult to do what I did afterwards. Also, the idea of running or helping to run an entire business when you're a manager at the CIA, if you're in a good work unit, you do have responsibility for a range of things and you do take ownership of it. But you always know that you have many, many thousands of other people who also co-own that organization on behalf of the American people. And the experience of actually helping to run a small business where you actually are responsible for everything was appealing. And so getting outside enabled me to have some of those experiences up to and including what I've been doing for the last two years at the Lawfare Institute. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0One of the things that you do when you leave is you write this book called The President's Book of Secrets. What gave you the idea? And then tell us a little bit about the book.\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0Which I will point out an enterprising young man named Michael Morell did speak to me for. So thank you for your insight and sharing your experiences. The idea went back to when I was selected as a PDB briefer. I remember having the thought and possibly expressing in a naive way during my interview for that job that it really would be nice to see the handbook, you know, the standard operating procedures for briefers to know how to handle certain situations based on the institutional history of decades of doing these level of briefings. And I do remember getting some rolled eyes and some laughter because there is no such thing.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0It's deep end of the pool stuff.\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0It's very much on the job. Learn as you do it. We select people as briefers because of their judgment, I was told. So use it. I said, OK, that's fine. But it would have been useful to know what had happened in the 1960s, 70s, 80s and then up through the 90s in terms of what mistakes others had made. So I didn't repeat the same mistake or what things had generally gone well so that I could build on the experiences of others. That was always in my head.\u00a0 And then after I had left and I was doing some teaching, I realized that there were a lot of good sources out there on this most sacred of things within the analytic enterprise, the PDB. And once I started talking to people, all of the previous administrations, presidents, vice presidents and CIA directors opened up in interviews and wanted to talk about it. And I thought that this was a story the American people should see about how this process apolitically works. And it was a story that would actually help other people coming into the intelligence business understand the foundation of the work they were doing at the time. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0Did you find it easy to get it cleared?\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0I have to say that it was easy, but because of the way that I did it. And that's not to pat myself on the back. I did it this way out of necessity. I wrote a chronological book. I was writing about the history, going back a little bit to the 1940s, but really picking up in the 1960s. There were very discrete parts of that. So I could write about John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and their interactions with intelligence. I could write those chapters while I was still doing the research and the interviews for people during the Bill Clinton and the George W. Bush administrations.\u00a0 And I asked the PRB, the publication review board, as it was called then, would it be possible for me not to submit the complete manuscript, but to submit it in parts such that you'll get two or three chapters at a time while I work on the others and you can process it. Basically to work in a more efficient way. They kindly agreed. And that meant that if two or three chapters took many months to clear, as they did, I could be working on other parts of the project.\u00a0 But you're right, there still is that final obstacle. And at the end there was a bit of trouble getting the final parts cleared. Even though there was nothing objectively classified. There were some sensitivities to even mentioning the current administration, which at the time was the Obama administration.\u00a0 Later on, the DNI and principal deputy DNI have said very flattering things about the book. But at the time, they certainly were in a position where they didn't want anything to make it look like the intelligence community was getting in the way of White House equities involving intelligence. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0Let's chat about the intelligence support that nominees for the president and the vice president get intelligence and get briefed. And then later, we'll talk about the support that a president elect and vice president elect get. So what kind of intelligence support does a president and vice presidential nominee get? What does that look like? How has it changed over time? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0This is funny because until 2016 and perhaps even now, it's a tradition that most Americans don't know about. And yet it's one of the longest standing national security traditions we have being a relatively young country. It goes back to 1952 when Dwight Eisenhower was coming into office, but we didn't know that yet. There was still an election to be had and Harry Truman was the president. And you'll recall he came into the presidency all of a sudden when Franklin Roosevelt died. And Truman felt relatively unprepared, certainly without the deep foundation of intelligence and national security that he would need to suddenly be commander in chief during the middle of a war.\u00a0 And he resolved in 1952 that his successors should not feel so adrift when they took office. Now, it helped that Dwight Eisenhower was one of the candidates who had been supreme allied commander and certainly understood the role of intelligence, but he'd been away from that for a bit. The other candidate was Adlai Stevenson, and he had no experience with national level intelligence. So Dwight Eisenhower offered to both candidates classified briefings to bring them up to speed on the world situation.\u00a0 And that tradition has continued ever since 1952. A couple of times candidates have not taken the briefings either because of scheduling reasons or they felt they didn't need them. Funny case in 1984. You'll recall Walter Mondale was running against Ronald Reagan. Years later, when asked why he did not take one of these briefings, Walter Mondale said he didn't remember, but probably because he didn't think he had a chance to win anyway. And he just didn't take that stuff seriously at the time.\u00a0 Kind of odd for a former member of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, but the tradition has continued. Now, we shouldn't conflate these briefings with the presidential briefings that get more attention, which is the briefings of the president's daily brief that each acting current president gets along with other members of his or her administration.\u00a0 These briefings for candidates are classified, but they are overviews. They focus on global hotspots to inform the candidates about the major issues that are out there. The original purpose that Truman had to educate them in advance of possibly becoming president has morphed somewhat. Now, one of the goals, if not the primary goal, is to help the candidates not inadvertently say something galactically stupid on the campaign trail, not to help them politically, but something that would get in the way of U.S. foreign policy or get in the way of their own foreign policy should they win.\u00a0 And it was, in fact, this reason that Jimmy Carter cited as the real value of getting these briefings during the campaign. He said he did not want to say anything that inadvertently would make things more difficult for the incumbent president and his opponent, Gerald Ford, or would box him in when he became president, which in fact he did based on that election in 1976. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0And are we talking about one briefing here or are we talking about a series of briefings over a period of time? What do they actually look like? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0It depends on the candidate, depends on the year. Some candidates have taken one briefing, in some cases rather short, and treated it almost as a check box exercise. Other candidates have gone all in. Jimmy Carter, again, is probably the ultimate example of this because the intelligence briefing tradition for candidates is linked to the nominating conventions, because that's when the major parties reveal who their candidates are and that's when they are officially the nominee for president. Jimmy Carter jumped the gun. He actually requested that his briefings start before he formally got nominated to be the Democratic presidential candidate.\u00a0 And the intelligence community agreed. They sent the Director of National Intelligence, back then called the Director of Central Intelligence, a guy named George H.W. Bush, they sent him to talk to Jimmy Carter and get that ball rolling. And he took briefing after briefing during the campaign. It's a little more institutionalized now. That is, it's been taken over by the office of the director of National Intelligence instead of being run by the CIA. And there is more procedure behind it. But it still is up to each candidate. They do not have to take these briefings. And technically, they don't have to be offered these briefings because they are a courtesy of the current administration to the candidates. And there is no law requiring that the incumbent president offer these briefings to the president and usually also to the vice presidential nominees as well. There's nothing requiring that they do so.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0 You mentioned earlier that that the focus of these briefings is on the important sweeping judgments on key issues. Is there any discussion in these briefings of sources and methods, how the intelligence community collects intelligence or any discussion of CIA covert action, the more sensitive materials? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0For the presidential candidates, generally no. They are not set up to do that. These are overview briefings. They can have classified information, but they're not containing top secret code word sources and methods information. They aren't supposed to talk about details of covert action. As a general rule, these are a little bit more generic than that. They can get very specific on particular countries, but they're not going to tell the candidates the names of spies collecting this information or anything like that.\u00a0 I do say generally, however, because it is a human process, and it is up to the personality and the judgment of the person giving the briefing. So you have had directors of Central Intelligence in the past who were going and briefing some of these nominees or their designees to do so, who would sometimes open the book a little bit more. And one of those cases was the one I cited earlier of George H.W. Bush briefing Jimmy Carter. And even when he was just a nominee, Bush had opened up quite a bit about the intelligence business, not just overviews about the politics of the Soviet Union or the military of China. But generally, the idea is to keep it limited because, face it, one of these people is going to lose. And you don't want to open up all of the most classified secrets of the government to someone who is going to lose. You want to give them enough that they'll be prepared if they win. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0You also mentioned that these typically happen after the nominating conventions. Do we know yet whether Joe Biden has received his intelligence briefing? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0I haven't seen any news about it, and that cuts both ways. The first way is it suggests he hasn't had them yet because the campaigns are now covered so extensively that it's unlikely Joe Biden would sneeze and we wouldn't hear about it. On the other hand, they may just be keeping it quiet and trying to keep it from becoming politicized. 2016 was the first campaign when these briefings became the subject of headlines. This was because some Democrats said Donald Trump should not get these traditional briefings that every other candidate since 1952 has been offered because he is constitutionally unable not to say what he thinks and he might just blurt out classified information. At the same time. You had people up to and including Speaker Paul Ryan saying Hillary Clinton should not be getting these briefings because she can't be trusted with classified information because she had some classified emails on her personal email.\u00a0 So it hit headlines because of that. But the briefings did go on. Each candidate, I believe, received two briefings and there weren't any leaks or spillage because of it. Will they happen this year? Usually they would have started by now. Because the conventions were delayed, it's possible Biden put it off. It's also possible Biden feels he doesn't need them. He was, after all, vice president and PDB recipient for eight years and something like 30 years on foreign relations or intelligence committees before that. If he has received them, it's not in his interest to go out and blab what was in those briefings anyway.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0Let's switch to the intelligence community supporting a president elect. Walk us through how that works, what the big muscle movements are there. DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0A dramatic thing happens once the results of the election is known. And it's a funny thing because technically there is no president elect until you actually have the Electoral College meet. But that is not the bar that is used for shifting things on the intelligence front. The intelligence front is shifted when there is a known result. Usually that's been election night. Obviously, we've had some years like 2000 when that wasn't the case. But more often than not, on election night, you know who the next president will be. What has happened since 1968, which was the first transition year in which there was a president's daily brief, is the current president has authorized the intelligence community to start briefing the president elect on the president's daily brief immediately to start getting them up to speed because of our relatively short roughly two month transition period.\u00a0 Most presidents have taken advantage of this and started to read the PDB, usually with an intelligence community briefer assigned to him during that transition. The oddity of all of it is the way it started was different. President Johnson offered it to President Nixon in 1968, and by all measures, President Nixon should have loved it. He was a former vice president for eight years who loved national security topics. He had certainly been involved in foreign policy as a senator, and yet he did not read the PDBs. He did not take a single face to face briefing from a CIA briefer during the transition. It may have been because he held a bit of a grudge. He always believed that the CIA had it out for him and they actually helped John Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. But either way, the intelligence community didn't really crack the nut that was Richard Nixon.\u00a0 They did the second best thing, which is they briefed Henry Kissinger, the person who would become his national security adviser. But after that, during the transitions, presidents generally have received the PDB part of that. It comes with a briefer and that relationship between the usually CIA briefer and the president elect has had several functions. One, of course, is it gets the president up to speed, it starts getting classified information, including much more highly sensitive information to help these people who sometimes are governors of states who have never seen classified information before, prepare for the job that they're inheriting. But it also has a purpose in the background, which led to the title of a great book on this by John Helgerson. He called it, 'Getting to Know the President.' That is, it's a process by which the intelligence community can learn. What are this president's preferences? What are the topics they're most focused on? What are the things that this president wants to see or not see even in the formatting of the products that we hand to him? It's a way of finding out what it is we can do better to serve the commander in chief as soon as he becomes commander in chief. There are several parts of this. One is the PDB itself. You have to remember until inauguration, the president's daily brief is the current president's PDB, not the incoming president's.\u00a0 So the president elect is looking at it, thinking, what are they talking about? Because in almost any administrations' arc, you're going to have very granular, detailed stories about specific slices of foreign policy. Somebody coming in doesn't have the back story. So often the briefer will bring in supplemental material. It could be transition memos and other prepared hand holders to connect the president elect to the current intelligence to show how we got to where we are here. It could be other finished intelligence products other than the PDB to fill out the story. Or it could be ad hoc memos and briefings that the president-elect requests or that the briefer says he's just not getting it. So let me offer up an expert briefing for somebody. I'll go back to 1992 when President Clinton had been governor of Arkansas and suddenly was inheriting the presidency. He ended up getting very specific memos to supplement the PDB on issues like Haiti, Bosnia, Somalia, basically the issues he thought he would be facing as policy issues right away when he took office. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0You mentioned that that that Henry Kissinger received the PDB during that transition period. Generally, who gets to see the PDB on the president elect's team? How does that work? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0This has evolved a bit over time. There were no hard and fast rules. But what seems to be the tradition now is the president and the vice president elect as constitutional officers, they can start getting the highest level classified information as soon as the current president allows them to. And all the presidents have done this. All the presidents have said the president elect and the vice president elect can start getting the president's daily brief and other classified information as they see fit. The other officers. There have been some variances over time, but the pattern in recent elections has been that when senior administration officials for the top national security positions have been- not nominated because technically they don't get nominated until the president is in office. But when they've been named, when they have been announced as the hopefully future secretary of state, secretary of defense, and national security adviser, not a confirmed position, but one that will definitely take shape after inauguration.\u00a0 When those power positions have been named. The tradition has been then they can start seeing the president's daily brief as well. Most of them do this because they want to get up to speed. Some do not in the transition period. For Barack Obama, for example, coming into office, Secretary of State designate Hillary Clinton was offered the PDB but decided to start reading it upon assuming the job instead of taking a briefing every day with it. The presidents themselves, as presidents elect have usually taken the opportunity for them and their vice presidents to start taking briefings on the PDB daily. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0There's a particular book that we have done over time, it's a book of short biographies on world leaders who may call a president elect to congratulate him or her. Talk about that. DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0There's really two huge areas that we haven't touched on by focusing so much on the finished intelligence of world hotspots. And one is just that. One is the often unclassified but sometimes classified profiles of world leaders and transition information to help the president elect with the huge amount of phone calls that they will be getting to congratulate them, but also to prep them for the visits they will make and the visits they will receive in the early weeks of the presidency.\u00a0 You can imagine there might be a governor of a state or a senator or representative or a businessman who is elected who has never had interaction with the president of name your country here. What the purpose of this briefing material is to get that president elect able to have a productive, fruitful conversation, not about policy. The intelligence briefing material doesn't tell the president what to say on policy issues, but offers things about the personality of the leader, perhaps the education, perhaps the hobbies and interests, and a brief review of some of that foreign leaders main issues, the things they are most likely to bring up initially with an incoming president. This really gets the president elect up to speed so that they can be more efficient in those calls. But also lay the groundwork for effective relationships when they become president.\u00a0 This has taken different shapes over the years. Now it tends to be an actual transition book with lots of information, all in one place for the president elect to use in decades past, sometimes they were individual memos or note cards based on what the president elect said. This is the leader I want information on. Don't give me a book full of things about the president of the Gambia. I'm not going to need that. But I am supposed to talk next week to the president of Mexico. What do you got? So that's one big area that supplements the PDB and other materials. The other one is operations. In this conversation, we haven't talked about the operational side of the CIA, but the intelligence community does a lot of operations that people don't know about, even from those candidate briefings we discussed earlier. So the intelligence briefers during this transition process will get the president up to speed on major issues concerning the operations of the agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, most of all, but then also brief them on covert action, because there are at any given time several different presidential findings in action regarding covert activities that have been approved by the president.\u00a0 Those are the current president's covert action programs. They're not the CIA's covert action programs. CIA may execute them, but they are the president's covert action programs. That changes as soon as the oath of office takes effect. And we have a new president. Suddenly those are the new president's covert actions. And if that new president doesn't like one of those covert actions, isn't convinced about the merits of it, they can end it. And in fact, some presidents have. Jimmy Carter famously, he stopped at least one of the covert action programs soon after taking office in 1981 based on briefings he had received about them back in December. So it gives the president's time to think about the covert action, to talk to their advisors about it and decide, is this something that we want as part of our overall policy when we take office. And then they can choose whether or not to have that as part of their program. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0How you think the intelligence community has fared in the Trump administration. How would you assess that?\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0Overall, I couldn't be more proud of my former colleagues in the intelligence community because the pressures they are facing just from the overall environment, if not individually, are huge. Usually you don't have a president who is publicly chastising his own intelligence agencies or publicly undermining conclusions they have reached that have come out in an unclassified format or in some cases classified formats. That's a hard thing to do to see what the president did. Speaking in front of the memorial wall at CIA, for example, in his first visit to CIA right after inauguration, and to hear him stand up in Helsinki and appear to take the side of Vladimir Putin over his own analysts. That's a hard thing to do.\u00a0 But I got to say. I'm proud of the fact that everyone I know who's in the business and I'm sure most of the people you talk to, they're putting their heads down and they're doing the work that is they are still getting intelligence analysis to the customers who can use it. And they're doing it without fanfare and without attention. Maybe the president has a very contentious relationship, especially on a few key issues, that he simply doesn't like the judgments he's hearing. OK, but for the many, many other people in the intelligence community who are serving assistant secretaries of state, the deputy secretary of defense, the desk officer at the Treasury Department, military commanders around the world, they're still doing their jobs on their accounts to make sure that those people who are making decisions have the best analysis they can get to make these tough decisions. And I'm proud of the work that the intelligence community is doing in all those ways that we're not hearing about because they're just not as sexy as hearing about these clashes at the highest levels. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0Are you optimistic that in a second Trump term you'd be able to say the same, or are you worried? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0I'm very worried. I think the trend line is negative for the erosion of norms and institutions on everything from Justice Department prosecutorial independence to the role of intelligence to provide objective and timely analysis. All of those are under threat because of this very different presidency. I do think that the vast majority of intelligence officers who were not directly affected by it would continue to do what I just mentioned, would continue to serve the national security interests of the United States and uphold their oath by doing the best job they can, not allowing themselves to become politicized for the customers who will still value and respect that service. At the presidential level, I think it would get much harder because any guardrails that the president does feel towards protecting these norms and institutions, a second term would be much more challenging for those guardrails. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0Do you have a sense of what a President Biden's relationship might look like with the intelligence community and what he may look like as an intelligence consumer? DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0Let's do a job of intelligence analysis on this. We don't have the best evidence, which is Joe Biden himself saying and backing up with some kind of documentation or evidence precisely what he would do on every front of intelligence policy relations. Short of that, what do you do as an analyst? You look for relevant information. You look for background, you look for experiences, and you look for the, if you will, the tea leaves that you can read around that person. And most of the signs here are pretty good for intelligence policy relations.\u00a0 First, you can look for the person and their track record with intelligence. Is this somebody who has a track record for either disregarding intelligence completely or, not challenging intelligence because that's healthy, but challenging the very purpose of intelligence and undermining it. And that's just not Joe Biden. What we've seen from Joe Biden's experience overseeing the intelligence community, from Capitol Hill, from serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and being a certainly more prolific recipient of intelligence analysis than many other members of Congress. He treated intelligence with respect and seems to have used it effectively.\u00a0 Then he was vice president for eight years and there were no intelligence scandals involving Joe Biden. It appears that he was a respectful recipient of the intelligence information he had and with the portfolio that President Obama gave him and the license to weigh in on so many foreign policy issues. Most of the signs are positive that Joe Biden understands the role of intelligence in a democratic society and understands how to use it effectively as a senior policymaker. We don't know what all of his priorities would be, but it wouldn't surprise me if one of those priorities would be to, in a sense re-establish the groundwork reestablish the foundation. To make clear this is how intelligence will be briefed to policymakers. This is how policymakers will respond if they don't like the intelligence in a constructive and probably in a private way, rather than taking it to the press. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0I just want to take that last point and just emphasize, presidents don't have to agree with what the intelligence community is telling them. Correct?\u00a0 DAVID PRIESS:\u00a0It's healthier if they don't. You can have an engaged president who challenges intelligence on a daily basis. One of the best examples of this goes back to George H.W. Bush when he was president and before that vice president, he was famous for challenging the briefings he was getting, sometimes even making bets with the intelligence briefer about the outcome of a foreign election or something else that was in the analysis that day. But that doesn't need to be a negative thing. That can mean that the president wants better evidence before he makes a tough judgment. It can be that the president doesn't quite buy the logic that the analysis is using to connect unknowns. It can be that they feel like alternative explanations have not been explored well enough. And that is a good role for a president or any other customer of intelligence to push the intelligence community to work harder and to let them know that their analysis is being valued. Because if you don't value the intelligence analysis, why bother pushing back against it and asking for more detail.",

            "article_content": "You may remember Fiona Hill from her passionate testimony, and English accent, during the impeachment hearings of President Trump. She held one of the most sensitive jobs at the White House as the president's top adviser on Russia. She's considered by scholars, the intelligence community, and politicians - both Republicans and Democrats \u2013 to be one of the world's leading experts on Vladimir Putin. When we sat down with Dr. Hill on Tuesday for her first interview since testifying, she told us her goal was to sound the alarm about Russian meddling in our political system \u2013 which is tearing us apart.\u00a0 Fiona Hill: Putin, sadly, has got all of our political class, every single one of us, including the media, exactly where he wants us. He's got us feeling vulnerable, he's got us feeling on edge, and he's got us questioning the legitimacy of our own systems. Lesley Stahl: But how much of our polarization, of the fact that we are heads butting in this country, how much of that came from the Russians? Fiona Hill: Well, certainly in 2016, a lot of it did. But they don't invent the divisions. The Russians didn't invent partisan divides. The Russians haven't invented racism in the United States. But the Russians understand a lot of those divisions and they understand how to exploit them.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Do you think we're in a second Cold War? Fiona Hill: I don't think that we're in a second Cold War. The one thing that people need to bear in mind is that the Russian military still has the capacity to wipe out the United States through a nuclear strike. But there is no ideological struggle. The Cold War were two systems against each other. In a sense we're in the same system. We're competitors. \u00a0 \u00a0 By the time Fiona Hill testified at the impeachment hearings, she had already left the Trump White House after spending over two years on the National Security Council. As a witness, she stood out for her passion and purpose in warning that Russia is up to no good -- again. Hill at impeachment hearing: Right now Russian security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 elections. We are running out of time to stop them. Lesley Stahl: Talking about 2020, there've been a lot of stories saying that the Russians are hoping that Bernie Sanders will be the candidate, the Democratic candidate. Does that make sense to you? Fiona Hill: It does make sense because what the Russians are looking for is the two candidates who are kind of the polar opposites. They're looking, you know, to basically have the smallest possible number of people supporting those two candidates with everybody else kind of lost in the middle. So that it exacerbates, exaggerates as well, the polarization in the country.\u00a0\u00a0Lesley Stahl: I'm listening to you. And yet, my mind is going over all the other factors that have so greatly contributed to this, like Facebook, Fox News, MSNBC. I mean, there are so many factors here. Fiona Hill: I think it's important for us to understand those factors and to do something about them. I'm deeply disappointed in the fact that Facebook and other outlets have not stepped up to the occasion to really address things that are just outright lies and falsehoods. Lesley Stahl: This whole issue of blaming Ukraine for meddling in the 2016 election that you spoke out against during the hearings. I mean, that really\u2013- isn't it that really is spreading Russian disinformation, right? Fiona Hill: This is very much a fictional narrative that has been propagated by the Russian intelligence services.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: And a lot of those Republicans were promoting it. And do they not know that it's Russian disinformation? Fiona Hill: Members of Congress have been briefed repeatedly on issues like this. Lesley Stahl: What about the Democrats? Have they also propagated any Russian disinformation? Fiona Hill: Yes they have. In the sense of talking about the President being illegitimate. She had worked as an intelligence officer on Russia under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. At the Trump White House, she was in charge of all of Europe. But she's best known for her shrewd analysis of Vladimir Putin. She's written what's been called the definitive book about him, and has met with him several times over the years. Fiona Hill: He wasn't a professional politician. He came out of the KGB. He had learned certain skills there. You're basically figuring out how to size someone up and then to figure out what makes them tick, what their vulnerabilities in particulars might be so how can you hone in on those to get people to do what it is you want them to do. Lesley Stahl: Do you think that he studied President Trump and did find some vulnerabilities and honed in on them with our president? Fiona Hill: He does this with absolutely everybody that he interacts with.\u00a0 For example with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at one of their first meetings. Fiona Hill: Putin knew from all of his research on her that she was very scared of dogs. Putin has a very big black Labrador called Konni. And has the black Labrador come into the room and the black lab immediately comes and starts sniffing around the chair of the chancellor. The whole purpose of that was intimidation.\u00a0\u00a0Lesley Stahl: Sure. Fiona Hill: The chancellor is, of course a professional. And she's a woman who is used to having people try to intimidate her and she kept it together. Lesley Stahl: Why do you think the president seems so allergic to criticizing Putin? He almost can't do it, or he won't do it. Fiona Hill: President Trump understands that President Putin does not like to be insulted. Putin takes it very personally. He harbors a grudge. He doesn't forget. And he will find some way of getting some degree of revenge as a result of that. Lesley Stahl: But for a lot of people, that the president has never and will never criticize Putin in any way has seemed strange. Fiona Hill: It's also a tactic that the president, President Trump, has employed with other world leaders as well. Lesley Stahl: You know, he's insulted our allies, the leaders of-- in the West. Fiona Hill: I mean he looked at the allies, you know, many times as though they're business counterparts. And so he brought the same style that he would've applied in, you know, pretty hard-nosed business discussions. I think that that did and has, in many respects, done some damage to many of our key relationships. Her journey to Washington was a steep, tough climb. She grew up poor - a coal miner's daughter in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in Northern England. But she ended up with a Ph.D. from Harvard and a top job at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. After 9/11, she became an American citizen. In her role at the White House, she was involved in briefings with the president. Lesley Stahl: Does President Trump ask good questions? Fiona Hill: He does, actually, because he's challenging assumptions. Again, this is somebody who hasn't come in from a government position. You know, obviously, there was a lot of insightful questions about why are things set up, how did that start. And a lot of questions about how much do things cost. I think the big disadvantage of constantly challenging is the fact that, you know, this disruption, this constant disruption, often makes it very difficult to move forward. Lesley Stahl: Now, as you've mentioned, you've also worked for President Barack Obama. I wonder how this president is different in how he makes decisions and what the whole process is in the White House. Fiona Hill: So with President Obama, he's a very different style. Very thoughtful, posed. He would often, you know, sit with his hand on his chin and just be looking at you and not really moving. And you'd be, you know, I have to say, feeling just a little, \"Is he-- is he listening?\" You know, he hasn't moved. And then he would ask maybe one or two really insightful questions. And obviously, President Trump has a much more freewheeling style, much more eclectic. He has his briefings with different people. And he just gets information from a lot of other sources. Lesley Stahl: What about the fact that the president seems to be getting rid of, purging almost people with expertise, people with a lot of experience in intelligence or diplomacy and replacing them with people who are loyal to him. Fiona Hill: We've got ourselves into a situation where government service is somehow seen to be a political act rather than an act of civic duty or of public service. There's been a lot of bandying around this term of \"radical unelected bureaucrats.\" We're in the middle of a public health crisis. You don't want somebody who's just looking up on Google or Wikipedia, looking up, you know, kind of the coronavirus online. Most of the public health officials are public servants and experts. We need those experts at times of crisis. And so it's deeply disturbing to see people trying to bring them all down for, you know, their own domestic political purposes. Lesley Stahl: I'm sitting here and every time I ask you a question about President Trump you defend him. And then you say things like that. And I keep thinking, \"Well, she's criticizing the president,\" without saying his name. Fiona Hill: There's an awful lot to criticize for everybody, correct? And I don't think that at this stage where we are in our political life that it does any good about doing any kind of personal criticism on anybody. But at the hearings, she seemed far more critical, describing a chaotic White House with NSC officials like her left in the dark, while rogue operators were off on missions for the president, like then-Ambassador Gordon Sondland.\u00a0 Hill at impeachment hearing: Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security-foreign policy and those two things had just diverged. And I did say to him, \"Ambassador Sondland \u2013 Gordon- I think this is all going to blow up.\" And here we are.\u00a0Lesley Stahl: When you took the job, I know that there were some of your friends who had urged you not to. I wonder if any of your friends stop talking to you.\u00a0 Fiona Hill: There were some people in the professional circles in which I move through [who] certainly took, let's just say, some took offense, frankly, at the fact that I had decided to get this. They had given me counsel not to do the job. And they, you know, actually did believe that I would be aiding and abetting something nefarious by joining the administration. I felt very strongly, however, that we were in situation where we were to a confrontation with Russia that someone like myself, who was not political, someone who was an expert should step up and try to do something. Lesley Stahl: Right after you started at the White House, there was a smear campaign against you. Public, distressing I'm sure. What was that all about? Fiona Hill: Well, I'm still trying to get to the bottom of some of that, to be honest. Alex Jones in YouTube clip: He's got a major Soros mole discovered in The White House, breaking now... \u00a0\u00a0 In May 2017, right-wing conspiracists launched an online campaign to discredit her.\u00a0 Roger Stone with Jones in YouTube clip: George Soros has penetrated the Trump White House. A woman named Fiona Hill--\u00a0 Fiona Hill: I have to say that the scale of this did take me by surprise. Lesley Stahl: This was Roger Stone-- Fiona Hill: It was, Roger Stone, Alex Jones. And I did think-- Lesley Stahl: So from the right? Fiona Hill: \"--Why me?\" Lesley Stahl: Were there death threats? Fiona Hill: There were death threats. There was-- quite a number of them, especially online. She found it disturbing. And she doesn't rattle easily, as the public saw at the impeachment hearings as she held her own when committee members challenged her. In becoming an overnight public figure, she found herself contending with the anxieties of her 13-year-old daughter. Lesley Stahl: How did she absorb all of this? Fiona Hill: Initially, she was, you know, somewhat concerned about the whole thing. Lesley Stahl: She must have been worrying all that time? Fiona Hill: But she also helped me put things into perspective. Because on the day before I was meant to testify in public, and obviously I was trying to prepare myself for this, she was preparing for a big test. And she was having me quiz her in the car when I was driving her to school. And she was getting quite anxious. And you know, I was kind of trying to pull rank on this one and said, \"Look, put it into perspective. You know, Mommy, tomorrow has to, you know, kinda testify before Congress and millions of people might be watching. And you know, I mean, this is a test. And she just looked at me and she said, \"This is much worse.\" And I said, \"What do you mean?\" And she said, \"Well, you just have to tell the truth.\" Produced by Shachar Bar-On.

            "article_content": "With his unwillingness to concede to President-elect Joe Biden casting a shadow over the White House, President Trump again claimed he won the election he has been projected to lose. He also accused the drug maker Pfizer of deliberately delaying the release of its coronavirus vaccine data until after the election because of his efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs. \"I won by the way, but, you know, we'll find that out, almost 74 million votes,\" Mr. Trump said during remarks from the White House press briefing room, which marked his fourth public appearance since Election Day. Mr. Biden has been projected to win nearly 80 million votes.\u00a0 Joined by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, the president denounced the pharmaceutical industry for running negative ads against him during the campaign and again accused drug companies of conspiring with the tech industry and the media to propel Mr. Biden to victory. The president-elect secured 306 electoral votes, while Mr. Trump won 232 electoral votes. Mr. Trump also alleged that Pfizer deliberately withheld data about its coronavirus vaccine, saying \"they waited and waited and waited\" to release the results of an ongoing study. The company\u00a0said Friday\u00a0that it is asking U.S. regulators to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine, days after Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech announced that its vaccine appears\u00a095% effective\u00a0at preventing mild to severe COVID-19 disease in a large, ongoing study. Mr. Trump was appearing before reporters to announce efforts by his administration to lower the cost of prescription drugs, revealing two new rules designed to help seniors, in particular. One is a \"most favored nation rule\" that would require drug companies to charge Medicare the lowest price for a drug paid by a major developed nation.\u00a0 \"Medicare will now look at the price that other developed nations pay for their drugs,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And instead of paying the highest price on that list \u2014 and we are substantially higher than any other country in the world, we will pay the lowest price,\" the president said. \"In other words, we take the lowest price, and we match whatever the lowest price is.\" The other rule would require pharmaceutical companies to redirect rebates for brand name pharmacy drugs from insurers to Medicare patients. Mr. Trump did not, however, respond to questions from the press and has not done so since Mr. Biden was declared the winner of the election nearly two weeks ago. \"Together these reforms will save American patients many, many billions of dollars every single year,\" Mr. Trump said. \"For generations the American people have been abused by Big Pharma.\" The president said he anticipates the new policies will be challenged in court, but expressed optimism his administration will prevail. While Mr. Trump has not responded to questions from the press about the election and his unwillingness to concede, he has been active on Twitter in pushing false claims that the election was rife with fraud and that millions of illegal votes were cast. The president and his legal team have mounted a series of long-shot\u00a0lawsuits\u00a0in battleground states that seek to delay certification of election results, though they have been largely unsuccessful in their efforts.

            "article_content": "Fourteen states are holding primaries on Tuesday, March 3, commonly known as \"Super Tuesday.\" American Samoa and Democrats abroad, which represents Americans living outside of the U.S., are also holding caucuses on Super Tuesday. More than 1,300 delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday, making it one of the most important days of the primary season. By comparison, only 155 delegates are awarded in the first four states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. If one candidate achieves a wide delegate lead on Super Tuesday, it could give that candidate the momentum that could be hard for other candidates to overcome. Here's the hour-by-hour breakdown (ET): Some facts: Sanders, who finished won the popular vote in Iowa and won New Hampshire and Nevada, claims that his campaign \"can bring millions of people into the political process who normally do not vote.\" His opponents fear he'll do the opposite, though, given his advocacy of multi-trillion-dollar programs like Medicare for All and free college and because he is a democratic socialist, rather than a Democrat. Sanders is leading in several states going into Super Tuesday, however, and has a large, loyal and motivated grassroots organization to turn out his key constituencies, especially young people and people of color, especially Hispanics. He's likely to perform well in California and Texas. His performance with black voters has been less impressive so far, as was the case four years ago. In 2016, Sanders lost heavily throughout the South to Hillary Clinton, beaten in Alabama by a virtual landslide of 78% to 19% and failing to win a single county in the state. Overwhelmingly, black primary voters, who made up 54% of the electorate, voted for Clinton 91% to 6% in exit polling. Only neighboring Mississippi awarded a larger margin of victory for Clinton over Sanders. Biden is going into Super Tuesday on a wave of African-American support from his win in South Carolina, and his strong poll numbers with black voters may help him in many of the states with large numbers of black voters, including Alabama, Virginia and North Carolina. As noted above, though, Sanders has more support among Hispanic voters. He's also racking up a number of endorsements after that win. In addition to the coalescing of his recent opponents around his candidacy, with Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's endorsements Monday, a number of moderate and establishment Democrats announced their endorsements of him, including former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, fellow Virginians Senator\u00a0Tim Kaine, Congressman\u00a0Bobby Scott\u00a0and Congresswoman\u00a0Jennifer Wexton, who unseated a GOP incumbent in 2018. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth also announced their support. Their endorsements going into Super Tuesday lends credence to an argument Biden articulated to CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns in an interview Monday.\u00a0 \"There's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist,\" Biden said. \"Imagine here in Texas or in North Carolina or in Georgia, the idea, if I said to you, 'This is an open test. You're running for office. Do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream Democrat running at the top of the ticket?' My guess is in most states, they'd say no.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Super Tuesday marks the first time Mike Bloomberg will be on the ballot, his first opportunity to see whether his hundreds of millions of dollars spent on television advertising will translate to a substantial number of votes and delegates. The sheer number of delegates is one reason Mike Bloomberg bypassed the early states altogether, knowing he could potentially scoop up enough delegates in the Super Tuesday states to become one of the top-tier candidates almost overnight. So far, Bloomberg has spent about $500 million on advertising, a staggering amount. For other candidates, Super Tuesday will mark their last chance to show they still deserve to be in the race.\u00a0 After Super Tuesday, the next primaries will be held on March 10, when Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington vote.",

            "article_content": "Social Security recipients will get a modest 1.3% cost-of-living-increase in 2021, one of the smallest-ever increases, due to low inflation. The average increase will amount to a $20 per-month bump for the 70 million seniors and others who collect the benefit. That would follow this year's 1.6% increase in the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, according to the Social Security Administration, which announced its 2021 increase on Tuesday. The COLA affects the personal finances of about 1 in 5 Americans, which includes Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees. The economic fallout from the coronavirus has reduced tax collections for Social Security and Medicare, likely worsening their long-term financial condition. While a decline in gas prices has kept inflation low in 2020, that may not reflect seniors' actual costs, analysts say. Health care expenses such as Medicare premiums have been rising much faster than inflation, a problem for older Americans, who tend to require more medical services than younger people. \"We are looking at a period where there are growing inadequacies in Social Security benefits, particularly for people with lower-to-middle benefits,\" said Mary Johnson, an analyst with the nonpartisan Senior Citizens League. Social Security benefits have lost nearly a third of their buying power since 2000, according to the Senior Citizens League. Next year's 1.3% boost represents one of the program's smallest-ever increases, following a meager 0.3% increase in 2016 and three years of no increase in 2009, 2010 and 2015,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Social Security Administration.\u00a0 According to the AARP, the program provides at least 90% of retirement income for 1 in 4 seniors. But there's been no real discussion of either program in the personally charged election contest between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. \"It's very difficult to talk about anything policywise,\" Johnson added. With the just-announced COLA, the estimated average Social Security payment for a retired worker will be $1,543 a month next year, an increase of $20 form 2020. A typical couple's benefits would increase $33, to $2,596 per month. The program's automatic inflation increases are fairly unique, since most private pensions do not offer similar adjustments. But Diana LaCroix, of Omaha, Nebraska, says her COLA doesn't cushion rising health care costs most years. And she has new responsibilities: Her eldest daughter and two grandsons moved in with her this summer after the daughter's landlord decided to sell the house they were renting. LaCroix, retired from customer service jobs, is now buying diapers some days as she scrounges for good deals on hand sanitizer. \"Something's got to give,\" she said. \"Something's got to change.\" People 65 and older went for Trump in 2016, but this time around some election polls show Biden even with or ahead of Trump among older voters. Trump has kept his promise not to cut Social Security benefits, but this summer he sent confusing signals to seniors, with a plan to temporarily suspend collection of certain taxes that fund the program. While White House staff said it was a limited measure that would have no lasting impact, Trump kept hinting to reporters that he had much bigger tax cuts in mind. Early in the year, he told an interviewer he wanted to tackle \"entitlements,\" or benefit programs, in a second term. Biden has a Social Security plan that would revamp the COLA and peg it to an inflation index that more closely reflects changes in costs for older people, particularly health care. That's been a priority for advocates. He would also increase minimum benefits for lower-income retirees, addressing financial hardship among the elderly. The former vice president would raise Social Security taxes by applying the payroll tax to earnings above $400,000 a year. The 12.4% tax, equally distributed among employees and employers, currently only applies to the first $137,700 of a person's earnings. The tax increase would pay for Biden's proposed benefit expansions and also extend the life of program's trust fund by five years, to 2040, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute. Jane Whilden lives in a household that leans heavily on Social Security. The southern New Jersey resident retired early from a local government job to serve as the main caregiver for her family, including her mother and her husband, a retired trucker. The program should be top of the list for the presidential candidates, she said. \"Everybody's getting older and we need to know what's going on,\" said Whilden. \"I haven't heard what they're going to do. You just hear all sorts of negative things.\" The COLA is only part of the annual financial calculation for seniors. Medicare's \"Part B\" premium for outpatient care usually gets announced in the fall as well. That amount generally increases, so at least some of any additional Social Security raise goes to health care premiums. The Medicare premium for 2021 has not yet been released, but there's concern that some emergency actions the government took in response to the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a big jump. That has prompted Congress to pass recent election-year legislation that limits next year's premium increase but gradually collects the full amount later on, under a repayment mechanism. \"There's a lot of uncertainty with regard to the effect of the coronavirus on the cost of the premium for next year,\" said Casey Schwarz, a policy expert with the Medicare Rights Center advocacy group. The Medicare monthly premium is now $144.60.",

            "article_content": "The House of Representatives delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Wednesday afternoon. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in remarks on the Senate floor, invited the House managers to the Senate at noon on Thursday to exhibit the articles.\u00a0 The trial is set for Tuesday. \u00a0 \u00a0 In his remarks, McConnell said, \"This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate. I'm confident this body can rise above short term-ism and factional fever and serve the long-term interests of our nation.\" On Tuesday, McConnell laid out how the trial will progress. He said the Senate will hear arguments by the parties, conduct a written question period, and then address what he called \"the more contentious issue of witnesses.\" CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0notes that Republican senators Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, and Lisa Murkowski have indicated they would like a chance to vote on hearing from witnesses after hearing the arguments. They have not committed to voting for witnesses, but would like the option to once they hear the arguments. If these three Republicans join all Democrats in voting to subpoena witnesses, then they'd only need one more Republican to join them to summon witnesses the House did not hear from.\u00a0Democrats have asked\u00a0to hear from four government witnesses, including Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell warned Democrats on Tuesday that he \"couldn't imagine that only the witnesses that our Democratic colleagues would want to call would be called.\" \u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS & ELIZABETH WARREN Since that awkward rebuffed handshake following Tuesday night's debate, we have not heard much from Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or their campaigns, note\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Cara Korte\u00a0and\u00a0Zak Hudak. \u00a0Reporters caught Sanders on Capitol Hill this afternoon and asked what was said between he and Warren. Sanders joked, \"The weather.\" The most robust response came from Sanders most trusted advisor, his wife Jane O'Meara Sanders, who spoke to the AP Wednesday afternoon. \"We remain committed to continuing a progressive movement made up of women and men, black and white, gay and straight,\" she said.\u00a0 \"Maybe people sometimes misremember things that happened,\" she added. \"But I know without a doubt that it is not anything Bernie would ever say. It is inconceivable because it's not what he believes. And there's proof of that going back many, many years.\" How serious should we take O'Meara Sanders' certainty? Her son, Dave Driscoll, weighed in on\u00a0Twitter: \"I've heard my Mom say this only a handful of times before 'This discussion is over'... we should all listen.\" If Driscoll is right, don't expect Sanders or his team to bring up this spat anytime soon. But know that Sanders will be back on the trail this weekend in New Hampshire, and with two town halls scheduled, we'll wait to see if voters ask him about Warren. \u00a0\u00a0 NEVADA Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard were among those to appear Wednesday at\u00a0the Native American Presidential Forum\u00a0in Las Vegas, hosted by Four Directions Vote and the Nevada Tribal Nations. The group sought commitments on issues facing Native Americans, from addressing a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women to revoking the military honors given to American soldiers who participated in the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports Steyer was the only candidate to speak in person at the event, which\u00a0struggled to book appearances\u00a0after the Democratic National Committee scheduled a debate in Iowa for the day prior. Others appeared remotely, with some\u00a0sending surrogates\u00a0in addition to pre-recording interviews or appearing via a livestream. SOUTH CAROLINA As healthcare continues to surface as one of the top issues on voters' minds in South Carolina, non-profit organization Medicare for ALL NOW! has launched five new digital ads promoting M4A. The ads are the first phase of a planned six-figure campaign aimed at pitching South Carolina voters on Medicare for All, while advocating for a single-payer health care system across the country. The Philadelphia-based group has hired 20 South Carolinians to begin mobilizing volunteers on the ground in five counties throughout the state. Kerri Evelyn Harris, Movement Director for the group, tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that the team strategically chose South Carolina to focus on voters of color in large part because it's one of the states that will choose the Democratic nominee. When asked, Harris added that although former Vice President Joe Biden has remained\u00a0popular\u00a0in the state throughout this primary cycle\u2014and is not a proponent of Medicare for All\u2014she thinks this message will still resonate with South Carolina voters. \"Obamacare is something that we are to build, it was a starting point and expanding access is not enough. Access doesn't allow you to actually pay your bills,\" said Harris. \"It doesn't allow you to actually afford to go to the doctor, it just says there's a doctor available. We have to make sure that people actually receive health care and that's the next step and that's what Medicare for All will do.\" South Carolina is one of 14 states that hasn't expanded Medicaid. CORY BOOKER Nearly a year after launching his presidential bid, Senator Cory Booker\u00a0suspended his campaign\u00a0this week as the Democratic Party faces renewed criticism for the lack of diversity among its presidential candidates.\u00a0 While Booker's South Carolina operation stayed at around 20 paid staffers throughout his time on the trail, the New Jersey senator had made the first-in-the-South primary state a priority early on and made 16 visits to the state after launching his candidacy\u2014the most of any candidate.\u00a0 Even before officially announcing his bid, Booker had started to court voters in the Palmetto State. In 2018, he was the keynote speaker at the Betty Henderson Elected Officials and Candidates Cook-Off, a flagship event for one of the state's Democratic Party's chapters. And last year Booker participated in another staple event in the state, \"King Day at the Dome,\" a week ahead of announcing his bid for the presidency. On the heels of the first Democratic debate of the year, which featured no candidates of color,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that South Carolina state Representative Annie McDaniel, a vocal Booker supporter, said that his run was important in part because of the diversity he brought to the race.\u00a0 \"It's always important when we have elections and when things are occurring in America that involve diversity, that we have diversity,\" said McDaniel. \"It's a shame that the DNC put so much pressure on candidates to raise money, raise money, raise money, raise money, and we talk about Trump being a billionaire and having no sensitivity, then why is it that we as Democrats are putting so much attention and so much focus on who can raise the money?\" IN THE HOUSE Connecticut GOP Chair J.R. Romano has asked congressional candidate Robert Hyde to end his campaign. The move came after Hyde's name and messages were unveiled in\u00a0some new documents released by the House Intelligence Committee, reports\u00a0CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \u00a0 In the documents, Hyde, a Trump donor, talked to Rudy Giuliani's former business associate Lev Parnas about tracking down U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's locations. \"She's talked to three people. Her phone is off. Her computer is off,\" Hyde said in one revealed message and said in another that he had relevant Ukraine associates.\u00a0 Hyde was looking to unseat Democrat Representative Jahana Hayes, and was one of four Republicans who had filed to run for the seat. In a Wednesday Twitter post, Romano\u00a0called\u00a0Hyde's bid \"a distraction for the Democrats to raise money and falsely label all Republicans with his antics. In my view he is not helping other Republican candidates or\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0win.\" In a response, Hyde said Romano should \"resign from the\u00a0@CTGOP\u00a0ASAP. Never did anything but rig elections including his own and was a staunch advocate against\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0and still is.\" Romano\u00a0had previously criticized Hyde\u00a0for his crude, now-deleted tweets about Senator Kamala Harris.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Arizona Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick announced Wednesday that she would be taking a leave from office to seek treatment for an alcohol dependence. In her statement, she said she had a serious fall last week, and wanted to face the \"underlying cause\" of that accident.\u00a0 \"I am finally seeking this help after struggling to do so in the past, and I am ready to admit that I, like countless other Americans, suffer from this disease. Hard work and determination \u2014 which have brought me success in life \u2014 have not been enough to win this battle. Other than being a wife, mother, and grandmother, the most important job in the world to me is representing my fellow Arizonans. I know I must get better in order to do my best in each of these roles,\" Kirkpatrick wrote in a\u00a0statement. \u00a0 Per the statement, Kirkpatrick's office will still be \"fully operational\" and that her positions on votes will be submitted to Congressional Record. Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, represents a slightly competitive district in Southeastern Arizona, and won by five points in 2018 after previously serving in another district from 2012 to 2014. The Cook Political Report rates the race as \"likely Democratic.\" One of her Republican challengers, Shay Stautz, tweeted\u00a0out his support to Kirkpatrick earlier Wednesday. \"We should all recognize it takes guts to ask for help when you need it,\" Stautz said.\u00a0 Another candidate, Brandon Martin, shared his support on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and said he is \"happy to hear, Mrs. Kirkpatrick, is seeking professional help to combat her illness and is taking the steps necessary to recover. I wish her, and her family the best as she begins her journey to a full recovery.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump signed an executive order and three memoranda Saturday meant to provide economic aid to those struggling during the coronavirus pandemic, with additional benefits for the unemployed and tax cuts for workers. The executive actions are intended to bypass Congress \u2014 which has been deadlocked in negotiations to extend relief \u2014 and could face legal challenges.  The actions, if implemented, would provide $400 in added unemployment benefits for those out of work because of the pandemic, and defer payroll taxes for those earning less than $100,000 a year. Unemployed workers had been receiving a supplement of $600, a benefit that expired on July 31.  In one memorandum, the president directed the treasury secretary to defer payroll taxes for workers \"most in need,\" from September 1 through December 31. The payroll tax, which takes money from workers' paychecks to fund Social Security and Medicare, would still eventually be owed by workers unless there is further government action. Mr. Trump also asked the secretary to explore ways of canceling the debt.  But measures relating to taxes and spending typically require legislative action by Congress. The president expressed doubt his orders could be challenged in court and said that he believed Americans would receive the promised relief quickly.  Mr. Trump's executive actions also seek to extend a moratorium on student loan payments and consider ways to halt some evictions and foreclosures.  States are expected to cover $100, or 25%, of the cost of the additional unemployment benefits, although it's unclear if governors would participate and how long it would take to implement such a plan. \"If they don't, they don't. It's up to them,\" Mr. Trump said about governors.\u00a0  Asked by CBS News' Paula Reid if he is giving \"false hope\" by bypassing the legal challenges, Mr. Trump answered \"I think this is going to go very rapidly through the courts.\"\u00a0  Reid then asked the president why he has repeatedly said he passed Veteran's Choice, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2014. Mr. Trump in 2018 signed an expansion of the law that allows veterans to seek doctors outside the VA system for health care.  \"Why do you keep saying you passed Veteran's Choice?\" Reid asked. \"It was passed in 2014, it was a false statement sir.\" Mr. Trump then abruptly left the news conference.  Democrats have proposed relief of $3.4 trillion, and the Republicans have proposed $1 trillion. Pelosi said Friday that she had proposed a compromise, offering to cut the bill by $1 trillion if Republicans added $1 trillion. She said that offer was rejected.\u00a0  White House officials had hoped to reach a deal on a smaller bill that included funding for schools, the paycheck protection program for small businesses and unemployment benefits.  Congressional Democrats have not budged on their insistence for a long-term extension of enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 per week. \u00a0  The president slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for not coming to an agreement with White House officials. Although he said \"hopefully we can do something with them on a later date,\" he repeatedly criticized Democrats.\u00a0  He claimed that Democrats were trying to \"steal the election\" by including election assistance provisions in their bill. Democrats argue that it is necessary to shore up state election systems in the middle of a pandemic, when it is expected that many voters will opt to cast their ballots by mail.  According to the Associated Press, the Democratic chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, accused Mr. Trump of \"brazenly circumventing Congress to institute tax policy that destabilizes Social Security.\" Also citing a threat to Medicare funding by Trump's action, Neal said, \"This decree is a poorly disguised first step in an effort to fully dismantle these vital programs by executive fiat.\"  Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon derided the president's plan for putting off the payroll tax, the AP reported. \"This fake tax cut would also be a big shock to workers who thought they were getting a tax cut when it was only a delay,\" Wyden said. \"These workers would be hit with much bigger payments down the road.\"  Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.

Today on FACE THE NATION, an excruciating election week is over, as America shatters voting records and elects its forty-sixth president. But the forty-fifth, so far, refuses to concede.\u00a0PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: The people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: For the seventy-four and a half million Americans who voted for the Biden/Harris ticket, Saturday was a rare day of jubilation in a year filled with fear and uncertainty. For the presumptive President-elect, the challenges ahead are enormous.\u00a0PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's because the other seventy million Americans who voted in campaign 2020 did not vote for the Democrats.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): We won't stop. We won't stop.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Some are die-hard supporters of President Trump who are challenging the projections and vote counts.\u00a0RUDY GIULIANI (Attorney to President Trump): Don't be ridiculous. Networks don't get to decide elections. Courts do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Actually, the voters do. But so far there is no evidence of fraud, and Democratic leads in a recount could be insurmountable.\u00a0PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: I'm proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In this election, more than a third of voters were non-white. More women voted than men, and the new administration reflects that diversity. Senator Kamala Harris will be the first woman, the first Black, and the first Asian American to serve as vice president.\u00a0SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: But while I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll hear from the Biden campaign co-chairman, Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond. Plus, we'll talk with Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin about governing in a Biden/Harris administration with what looks to be a divided Congress. We'll take a look at the potential legal challenges from the Trump campaign in key states and get an update on the dangerous new phase of coronavirus with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Plus, the legendary Bob Schieffer weighs in on the burden on a Biden administration to unite America moving forward.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning. Welcome to FACE THE NATION, and to a new week. Last week, American democracy was tested, as we waited more than three and a half days for votes to be counted and a presidential projection to be made. Saturday morning, former vice president Joe Biden was projected the winner, defeating an incumbent for only the fourth time in the past one hundred years. And although America has decided, President Trump has not conceded that he's been defeated. As of this morning, President-elect Biden has two hundred and seventy-nine electoral votes, nine more than the two hundred and seventy needed to win. Four states have not been determined yet, Georgia and North Carolina are toss-ups, Arizona is leaning Democrat, and President Trump is likely to win in Alaska. Despite the relief that the election is over, the coronavirus pandemic around the world has reached dangerous highs in case numbers. Yesterday, the U.S. recorded over a hundred and twenty-seven thousand new cases, while Europe is seeing its own terrifying highs. France, a country with one fifth the population of the U.S., reported nearly ninety thousand cases on Saturday. We begin this morning with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): From sea to shining sea, our two Americas have a result but not reconciliation.\u00a0MAN #1: No respect for this country.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Instant reaction coast to coast to the President-elect.\u00a0(Crowd singing)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: And already the winner is repudiated by roughly half the country, just like his predecessor.\u00a0MAN #2: We haven't raised a white flag by no stretch of the imagination. You know, we're here until this thing is rock solid done.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: In Pennsylvania, the keystone battleground state, Trump supporters claim, with zero proof, six hundred thousand votes have been stolen.\u00a0RUDY GIULIANI (Attorney to President Trump): Some places may be amateurs at voter fraud. Philadelphia is a professional place for voter fraud.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: In the next few days, expect the Trump legal team to file a series of long-shot lawsuits. They filed a new one Saturday in Arizona. Those suits will allege widespread vote-stealing irregularities, from faulty signatures to tallies from dead people. Critics, including some Republicans, charge it's all political theater.\u00a0GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER (R-Massachusetts): I think the President's comments that there's some national conspiracy around this aren't supported by any facts.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Courts have rejected similar suits in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL (Republican National Committee Chairwoman): We will not give up on this process until every last issue has been resolved.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: For the Trump campaign, that leads recounts in razor-thin races. Georgia has called for one, Wisconsin's another possibility, so is Pennsylvania. But that state's law requires a margin of one half of one percent or less, and the Biden lead is beyond that and growing.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Recounts in past major elections have shifted votes from a handful to a few hundred, but they seldom change outcomes. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. Thanks.\u00a0The President has been uncharacteristically quiet since the race was called with the exception of Twitter activity. That's not the case just outside the White House. Paula Reid reports.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0(Crowd cheering)\u00a0PAULA REID (CBS News White House Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Just moments after networks projected Joe Biden as the next President, an impromptu celebration erupted outside the White House. Earlier Saturday, the President headed out to his Virginia golf club. He appeared to be on the course as news broke of his projected defeat. Later, he posed with a wedding party while receiving well-wishes from supporters.\u00a0WOMAN: Don't give up. Don't give up.\u00a0PAULA REID: In a speech Saturday, President-elect Biden called for unity.\u00a0PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself, but now let's give each other a chance.\u00a0(Crowd cheering)\u00a0PAULA REID: CBS News has learned advisers urged the President to make public remarks, but instead he took to Twitter, falsely claiming \"observers were not allowed into the counting rooms. I won the election.\" In fact, election officials say poll-watchers from both parties were allowed to observe. He is now the third President or nominee to lose the popular vote twice. The President still pointed out that his seventy-one million votes were \"the most ever for a sitting President.\" With the race called for Biden, the President's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, dug in, vowing more legal challenges.\u00a0RUDY GIULIANI: First of all, obviously, he is not-- he is not going to concede when at least six hundred thousand ballots are in question.\u00a0PAULA REID: Senior White House officials tell CBS News the President will concede when all legal options are exhausted and when the final numbers reflect a Biden win.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0PAULA REID: White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is currently recovering from COVID, along with at least four other White House staffers, and in his absence a lot of aides are pointing fingers at the President's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, asking why he didn't have a better strategy ready to contest the election results. Even the loyal vice president is coming under scrutiny. While Mike Pence typically provides his counsel and support behind closed doors, when it comes to offering public support at this critical moment, many aides are right now asking, where is Mike Pence? Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Paula, thanks.\u00a0We go to Biden campaign co-chair and Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond. He's in Philadelphia. Good morning to you.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND (D-Louisiana/@RepRichmond): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There are seventy-three days until Inauguration Day. I know you're fresh off a win, but that clock has already started. The President-elect announced last night he plans to form a COVID task force. What can you tell us about what they will do and what his first priorities are?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, I can tell you they're going to take the-- the Biden COVID plan, and they're going to turn it into policy and action items so that on day one we are ready to start to implement our plan and our vision for how we deal with COVID. And, of course, that involves robust testing, tracing, and dealing with the economic fallout of COVID.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Biden received nearly-- the President-elect, I should say, received nearly seventy-four and a half million votes. But President Trump got a pretty impressive turnout of seventy million voters. Isn't that a strong sign that Trumpism is not dead? This is a force that you will have to reckon with.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: No, look, I think Vice President Biden will be a different kind of president. I think he's going to be able to bring House members from the Republican side, House members-- Senate Republicans together on legislation. He served with many of them. But then again, you have to look at his numbers. He won Arizona. He won Georgia. And that will give him some coattails and some leverage when dealing with the Senate.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Perhaps some, but the President-elect just narrowly held together that so-called blue wall of Midwestern states. I mean, if you look at the breakdown in-- in Wisconsin, for example, much of his victory was delivered by large margins in-- in cities, areas like Milwaukee. If you look at it, the more rural areas, only two of the twenty-three counties that voted for President Trump in 2016 and, before that, President Obama actually flipped. So that divide still exists. Why do you think it seems to be deepening that divide between rural and urban America?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, we control the House. Democrats control the House. The question is about the Senate and senators are elected statewide. And so when you look at us winning statewide in places like Georgia, I think that that is a wakeup call to many senators that it's a different day. And, you know, statesmen, they look at the next generation. Politicians, they look at the next election.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: And so the fact that the battlefield will be a lot different for the Senate in two years. I think that all of that is leverage for us to achieve our agenda. But again, we want to work with both sides because at the end of the day, it's the American people we're trying to help. The old saying is that when two elephants fight, only the grass suffers.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, a lot of CBS polling has consistently shown that the American people blame both parties, particularly when it comes to this failure to deliver immediate financial relief for COVID-19. Do you think it was a miscalculation for Democrats not to compromise on that before the election?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, no, look, if we separate our COVID relief, then people will get left behind and corporations will get taken care of. What the real failure was that we have a President of the United States that will not pick up the phone and call the Speaker of the House. Speaker Pelosi has been very clear that she's willing to move, she's willing to meet halfway. But at the end of the day, we have to take care of front line workers. We have to provide state and local governments, money for policemen and firemen and front line workers. If we do a COVID relief package without that, without taking care of the American people and state and local governments, it's a hollow package that will still hurt our inner cities and our states.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect that to pass before January?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: I would hope so, and we're coming back into session in the next week or so, and that will be one of our priorities.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand Democrats remain in the majority, but you did lose seats as a party in the House. Do you think there needs to be a change in leadership?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: No, I don't.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You continue to support Speaker Pelosi then?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: I do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague Whip Clyburn on Fox said recently, \"defund the police and Medicare for all and socialism were albatrosses around our necks.\" He was talking about this last election. Do you agree that these messages that may actually have energized some progressive voters, some young voters, have ultimately hurt your party? Is there a reckoning that needs to happen among Democrats?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, I certainly think there should be a conversation. Now look, our progressive wing of the party is very important to our party, but I think that what Whip Clyburn was trying to say, that no matter how progressive your ideals and values are, and what you want to do and how bold your plans are, if we don't win, if we don't keep the majority of the House, you cannot implement any of those plans. So you can't govern if you can't win. And so I think our party has to make sure that we have a solid playbook of what we want to do, how we want to help the American people. But, when we lose and if we lose the House of Representatives, then we will be in the minority and we won't pass a bill for at least two years. And I think that-- that his point is we have to make sure we win first and govern second. And so when we govern, we will govern with our values. But when we can't pass legislation, we shouldn't be out there talking about it. And some titles hurt. Defunding the police is a title that hurts Democrats, and especially when the fact of the matter is nobody's calling for defunding the police.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: We're calling for reinventing how we police communities in this country, how we do criminal justice. So, I think that basically what the Whip is saying, and I agree with, is that words have consequences. And in this election, those words cost us some Democratic members.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much congressman for your time this morning. Congratulations.\u00a0FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who joins us from Charleston, West Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D-West Virginia/@Sen_JoeManchin): Morning, Margaret. How are you?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I'm doing well. I wonder if you agree with your Democratic colleague, Congressman Richmond, who said this was a wakeup call to senators this election, that it is a different day. Do you agree? And what should the President-elect's first order of business be?\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, basically, Joe Biden has said he's going to be a president for all of us, and that's exactly what he has to do, bring us all together, bringing Democrats and Republicans together, because it is a wakeup call for all of us. The country is more divided now than any time in our history or basically any time since the Civil War, as far as I can see. And we don't want to go back to those days, so we have to come together. Joe Biden got elected in a very, very contested primary, and all the nuances that were thrown on the Democratic Party is not who we are. He was not for any of this stuff. And I think Jim Clyburn said it best, that was an albatross around us. Basically labeling every Democrat as a socialist or supporting socialism, that's not who we are. It's not who I am. It's not how we were raised. And it hurt a lot of good Democrats in rural America, Montana, for one. Other places around the country.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, President Trump says he's fighting for the forgotten men and women, and he seems to define that as non-college educated whites. Eighty percent of the workforce in your state lacks a four-year college degree. It went ruby red for President Trump. Why didn't the Democratic Party's message break through?\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, it was a-- it wasn't a good message. I mean, we let them tag us before basically we could remind the people who we are, but we didn't have a good message. I'll be very honest with you, Margaret. Here is the thing, four years ago in rural America, in America in general, voted for Donald Trump because Democrats were mad, independents were mad. They thought they'd been left behind. And I always said this, West Virginians felt like they were returning Vietnam veterans. We did everything this country asked and now we weren't good enough or you left us behind. There was no pathway forward. So they voted in record numbers. They went from being mad to being scared in 2020. They were scared of this socialism that was thrown out there by a radical part of the so-called left that was throwing all this out, that basically scared the bejesus out of people and that hung on and hung on strongly. And it's not who we are. It is not who we are and it's not what we're about. And I have fought against that. Joe Biden has fought against that. We're not for New Green Deal. We're not for all the things that he's talked about, Medicare for all. We can't even pay for Medicare for some. We've got to take care of a lot of things.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about that, because there-- I understand who-- who you say Democrats are. But obviously there isn't a lot of agreement at this point within the party. Your Republican colleague, Mitt Romney said, \"This election shows conservative principles are on the ascendency. Americans don't want to get rid of coal or gas. They don't want Medicare for all.\" You just said that the Green New Deal is not something that people want. There's a whole lot of fracking, I understand, in West Virginia and a whole lot of coal. But did the President-elect's energy message hurt him? Is that also what you're saying? It's not just socialism, that is what Joe Biden said.\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: What Joe Biden said, and what Joe Biden's bill is, the Biden energy plan--and we're working with that--is going to be an all-inclusive. You need all of the energy. First and foremost, you must be energy independent. To have the most powerful nation on earth, we can't be dependent on foreign-- on any foreigners-- foreign countries for our energy sources. So that means we're going to use coal and we're going to use gas and we're going to use oil and we're going to be able to-- to use our renewables and be able to develop the fuels of the future. But we're going to do it in the cleanest fashion. I believe in innovation, not elimination. And we've talked about this--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: --and what was said and what we're going to do is two different things. And it did come across wrong, and it was very difficult. But that didn't help at all. But I can tell you, Joe Biden is not against fracking. Fracking can be done. And we do it every day in West Virginia and do it in the safest manner. We capture the methane.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: We don't let it escape into the air and all these things can be done better.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you what can actually get through because it seems in early reporting, the Biden camp will have to rely on a lot of executive orders, particularly if the Republicans hold on to the Senate as they appear poised to do. That would make it hard for him to repeal, for example, the Trump tax cuts. That would make it hard for him to repeal liability protections for gun manufacturers. I mean, is the message from this election that Democrats need to be moderate?\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Oh, I've always been moderate. I would-- I would-- I would encourage all Democrats to be moderate, find the middle if you can. We're not going to be able to govern from the extremes or from the fringes. Never have been. But when you're talking about the things you are-- fiscal responsibility wasn't even spoken about in this election, not in-- our side. And Republicans-- we piled on more debt in four years-- in the last four years, more debt at a faster rate than any time since World War II. Someone should be concerned about that. So I believe I-- I say-- I've always said I'm fiscally responsible and socially compassionate. I believe most Americans are, my moderate Republican friends and the moderate Democrats. We've got to govern from that middle, that moderate middle. Joe Biden has always been there. He knows how to work across the aisle. He'll reach out first and make this Senate work and give it every chance he can. And I can assure you, there are my Republican friends that are concerned about this runaway debt. They want to make sure that we're able to do it in a fiscally--MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: --responsible way. So you'll be surprised. There'll be more and more crossing over wanting to work in a more moderate, moderate Senate. I really believe that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll see if that happens. Thank you very much, Senator Manchin.\u00a0SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Pennsylvania, the state that put President-elect Joe Biden over the top. Joining us from Bethlehem is Republican Senator Pat Toomey. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY (R-Pennsylvania/@SenToomey): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Your home state, as we just said, put Biden over the top. Is it time for President Trump to concede?\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: You know, seventy million Americans voted for Donald Trump and they and the President deserve to have this process play out. Now, I understand yesterday the media projected how this is going to end and the media projection is probably correct. But there is a reason that we actually do the count. And by the way, part of our process is to adjudicate disputes. It can include recounts. In fact, under Pennsylvania law, there's an automatic recount if the vote margin is half a percent. At the moment Joe Biden is leading in Pennsylvania by only six tenths of one percent. So, let's let this come to its proper conclusion and-- and in the process, maximize the number of people who have confidence it was done properly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Joe Biden is ahead by more than thirty thousand votes. I mean, you understand at a certain point that a recount--\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --really wouldn't just change the math.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Pennsylvania law has an automatic recount, we should follow the law.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Now if it comes to a lead that's outside of the automatic recount margin, then Pennsylvania law gives the losing candidate the opportunity to petition for a recount. The loser has to pay for it. And you're right, that recounts very seldom change the outcomes. I understand that. But there's nothing wrong with following the process in the law.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And you're not saying it's not being complied with?\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: I've not said that, no.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: We're not finished yet, that's all. That's all I'm saying.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We have to take a commercial break, but I want to continue this conversation on the other side of it. So please stay with us, Senator.\u00a0And we'll be back with our next half hour.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from Senator Toomey as well as election law expert David Becker, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and our own Bob Schieffer. It wouldn't be an election without his closing thoughts. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, and to our conversation with Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey.\u00a0Senator, just a moment ago, you were saying rightfully that it is well within the President's team's legal right to raise questions or to ask for recounts. But there's a whole lot of noise being made by a lot of presidential allies who are alleging far more than that, using terms like fraud, rigged. In fact, Lindsey Graham, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he's asking the Justice Department to investigate claims here. There are nine GOP congressmen from your state who are questioning the integrity of election officials. Isn't this damaging overall to our democracy?\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: You know, every election has some irregularities, we've had some in Pennsylvania in the past, we had some in Pennsylvania this time. They should be adjudicated. If people have seen, if there is evidence of fraud or wrongdoing, by all means, go into a federal court, get it corrected, punish the wrongdoers, correct the vote count and do what we need to do. That's what I think should happen. Apparently, they're going to be a lot of lawsuits tomorrow. We'll see the evidence. We'll see what the allegations are. I have confidence in our federal judiciary to make the right decisions about them, and then we'll be able to wrap this up and move on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear, you have seen none of the evidence that the President's lawyers say they have about your state?\u00a0SEN. TOOMEY: So-- well-- well, to be clear, for instance, there-- there are some problems that need to be solved. For instance, in Pennsylvania, unfortunately, we have a rogue state Supreme Court that violated the U.S. Constitution and violated Pennsylvania law by declaring that ballots arriving after the Election Day can be counted, even though our statute forbids that. So, that needs to be adjudicated. Those ballots--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know--\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: --should not be counted. Now--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --those, those--\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: --I don't think those are enough--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --ballots haven't been counted. Those ballots have been segregated--\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Well, then--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --and CBS News has learned there are about eighty-five hundred of them.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Okay-- okay. So I think the number is probably not big enough to determine the outcome of the election. But observers in Philadelphia anyway, have not been able to get close enough to-- to understand how that segregation has occurred. This is the kind of thing that should just be clarified. As I say, I don't think it's going to be nearly a large enough scale to change the outcome of the election. But it's understandable that people would want that corrected. And we should, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is future elections.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Broadly, I want to know what you think the message from this election was that the Republican Party has remade itself as the party of Trump. Do you believe that is still the mandate?\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Well, I will tell you unambiguously, this was a rejection of the radicalism that has increasingly been the driving force in the Democratic Party, the woke left had a major setback. I mean, nobody thought we were going to pick up seats in the House. Nobody thought we were going to hold the Senate, which I think is likely. We didn't lose a single legislative body across the country--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President also didn't take your state.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: --in Pennsylvania in our state House and Senate. That's right. And I think, you know, there's no question that-- that personality traits and character traits of the President rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. And that was probably problematic for the president. It certainly was. And-- but-- but, you know--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SEN. TOOMEY: --the outcomes that this administration has been remarkably successful with economic outcomes--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: --with foreign policy. So I think the policy-- policies have been accepted. And the broad Republican victories down ballot--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: --suggest that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Toomey, thank you for your insights today.\u00a0And we want to take a closer look now at some of the legal questions the President's team is raising, with CBS News contributor and election law expert David Becker. Good morning to you.\u00a0DAVID BECKER (CBS News Contributor and Election Law Expert/@beckerdavidj): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the senator from Pennsylvania and his description of what's going on in his state. What-- what's your reaction?\u00a0DAVID BECKER: Well, he's right about a couple of things. He's right that right now President Bi-- Vice President Biden-- President-elect Biden leads by a margin outside of the recount margin. And actually, that margin is likely to grow. It's around forty one thousand right now and it's likely to grow beyond President Trump's victory margin of twenty sixteen of forty four thousand later today. So it's very unlikely it'll be an automatic recount in Pennsylvania. He's also right that the election overall was very good for Republicans. They did very well nationwide. They held the Senate, they gained seats in the House. They did very well in state legislative races. And any baseless accusations that the election lacked integrity actually cast doubt on those results, as well as the President's results. I think in Pennsylvania specifically, there are some claims regarding observers that are false. We know from Republican election officials in Philadelphia that observers for the Trump campaign and the Republican Party were present in the counting rooms at all times. They could see everything that was going on whenever ballots were out.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It was actually a live camera, streaming--\u00a0DAVID BECKER: Yeah, there's a twenty-four/seven live stream. There's recordings of there's-- there's extensive evidence of this. And as you noted, the ballots that arrived after Election Day have not been counted yet. They have not been reported. All of the ballots that we're seeing right now, the vote counts in Pennsylvania. They all reflect ballots that were received on Election Day or earlier. So those ballots that were issued, those very small number of ballots, perhaps eighty-five hundred of them--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DAVID BECKER: --that have-- that have been segregated pursuant to the Supreme Court's order, they have not been counted or reported out yet. And in fact, if you're behind, as President Trump is right now in Pennsylvania, it's unusual that you're not asking for those ballots to be counted because you might need more ballots to narrow the margin.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So can you help us make sense of what the Trump strategy may be here? Our reporter Nicole Sganga spoke to some members of the Trump team, and the strategy was described to her as planning to win the Georgia recount and point out irregularities in Wisconsin. That still doesn't get you to two hundred and seventy electoral votes. What is the strategy?\u00a0DAVID BECKER: It's very hard to determine a coherent strategy here because, for instance, in Arizona, you see them arguing to count more votes. In Pennsylvania, they're saying stop the count. In Wisconsin, the margin of victory for President-elect Biden is about the same as Trump's margin of victory in 2016, which-- which a recount upheld. It's very, very unusual. In fact, it's-- there's no precedent in American history for a margin of thousands of votes to be overturned in a statewide race. Other guests have mentioned this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, am-- am I hearing you say this is more of a PR strategy than a legal one?\u00a0DAVID BECKER: That's what it appears to be. I mean, if you look at Florida 2000, you had two very competent teams of-- legal teams. And, in fact, three members of that team on the Republican side are now sitting on the Supreme Court. And they went down and collected facts for weeks and then litigated that out through the court system. What we're seeing now is crazy allegations being thrown around on Twitter and elsewhere. And when it goes to court, they fall-- they-- they fall apart. There's no-- nothing there. They've been losing every case that has been brought post-election, the Trump campaign has.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DAVID BECKER: And so it does appear it might be more of a PR stunt than it is an actual cohesive legal theory.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So it-- it-- it-- to be fair to those, because there are some big names involved in this. Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the-- the Judiciary Committee, says he has a sworn affidavit from a postal worker in Pennsylvania. Rudy Giuliani, the President's attorney, also claims he has affidavits. Can people just lie and get away with it? Or are these affidavits actual evidence that needs to be considered at this point?\u00a0DAVID BECKER: This is why we don't litigate cases outside of landscaping companies. This is why we actually go to court and require proof. And every time they've brought this proof to court, that proof has fallen apart and failed. So--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about a landscaping company because that's where the Philadelphia press conference was held yesterday.\u00a0DAVID BECKER: Yeah, that's right. So, I mean, it's important. You can say whatever you want on Twitter. You can say whatever you want when you're being interviewed or at a press conference. But ultimately, you have to prove these allegations in court. And ultimately, each of these allegations has failed.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Trump campaign has filed suit in Nevada, Arizona. They have plans for other states, they say. Are any of these significant? I mean, they're also raising money, they say, for a recount in Wisconsin.\u00a0DAVID BECKER: So I think the recount strategy is likely to fail because the margins are just too great. We just don't see any historical precedent for overturning margins that great. The margin is growing in Georgia. It's over ten thousand now. The other litigation really doesn't have a strategy, whether it's Sharpie pens in Arizona or whether it's observers in Pennsylvania or the late arriving ballots in Pennsylvania. We're not seeing much there, there. And so I think it's unlikely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One thing I-- I didn't get to with the senator was this really troubling incident in Philadelphia, at the center where they were counting mail ballots, there were heavily armed men, arrested outside. You know, a lot of these election workers.\u00a0DAVID BECKER: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How concerned are they for their safety right now?\u00a0DAVID BECKER: They are very concerned. I talked to some of them yesterday. There are-- these are people who have been away from their families for days. They haven't seen them much. One of them-- his son, just had a birthday and he had to miss that birthday essentially because he was working the polls. They are getting no sleep. They're getting death threats.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DAVID BECKER: Some of them include racist and anti-Semitic language. And then we hear about this threat on their lives. It's shameful. I mean, these are public servants who are doing you know-- they're not always well-paid. They're not really well paid at all. They don't get a lot of recognition. Usually we only know their names, when something goes wrong. They're really heroes of democracy right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're working amid a pandemic. So, thank you.\u00a0And we thank all of them, all the election workers who helped our democracy function.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The election may be over, but this new surge of coronavirus cases is just now beginning to take off. We want to check in now with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Good morning. The President--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --the President-elect says his very first priority is dealing with this pandemic, and he's going to name a task force tomorrow. Some of the names released by his campaign include a former surgeon general from the Obama years, as well as the former Homeland Security adviser. Realistically, what can a group like this do now since they don't take office till the end of January?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think the first thing they want to do is come in with a very clear plan and the President-elect has articulated what he would do. I mean, there's not a lot of novelty to this. We know what works. We know what we need to do. And so they want a plan for how they're going to hit the ground running to try to implement their strategy. The other thing that the President-elect and his team could be doing is working directly with the National Governors Association. We have one President at a time. They cannot govern. They are not in a position to govern, but they can start working with the governors to try to formulate policy through the governors, with the governors, and try to create a more national strategy that way. Because if you're not going to have a federally led national strategy in the next couple of months and it's going to be led at the state level, you at least want to coordinate across the different states, so it starts to have the semblance of a more cohesive plan.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds a pretty grim assessment of what you think the Trump administration might do between November and January to get a hold of the virus.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm not sure what they're going to do. I mean, my advice to them would be to get more aggressive. We're past the election. And I think they need to focus on what we can be doing nationally. We've been sort of arguing politically over what I think is a false dichotomy, a strawman, that it's really a choice between lockdowns and no lockdowns. And that's not the case. We-- we don't need to shut down the country, close businesses, tell people they need to stay at home to get some measure of control over this virus. We're not going to get perfect control over this virus. It's a contagious virus. It's going to spread, but it doesn't need to spread at the levels and at the velocity that's going to start to press the health care system, which is what we're seeing. We're seeing that in Wisconsin now. It's building field hospitals. Utah's building field hospitals. El Paso built their fourth mobile morgue. We now have-- we're going to have a record number of hospitalizations this week. Now, fifty-six thousand people are hospitalized. Eleven thousand are in the ICU. These are very big numbers nationally, and it's accelerating very quickly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The President-elect said he wants to quickly appoint a supply commander to oversee production and distribution of testing and then eventually a vaccine, materials, masks, and gowns. You previously said that a lot of these wheels are really already going to be in motion by the time he takes office. Are these realistic expectations for him to be setting?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think you need to do it anyway. The reality is that by the time the President-elect takes office, we'll probably be at the sort of apex, if you will, of what we're going through right now. You know, this is going to play out over the next couple of months. And I think as the President takes office, we'll be coming down the other side of the epidemic curve, hopefully. And the only question is going to be how many people have died in the course of this and how many people have been infected. And we have to keep those numbers down as much as possible. But there's still a lot you can do, I think, as you come in trying to make sure you're going to have adequate supplies of drugs, potentially vaccines, if we have safe and effective vaccine available and the testing equipment, the supply chain, because this isn't going to be over in 2021. I think 2021 will be much better than this year. But you still want to make sure you have adequate supplies as you come down that epidemic curve and head into the fall in 2021 when we're going to face risks again. But there's still probably a lot you could do in the near term, especially with the supply chain.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's something that can be affected in the near term. Things like durable medical equipment, testing supplies, gloves, gowns, masks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So there have been a lot of celebratory gatherings in the past twenty-four hours, mostly with masks, but not all. And I-- I wonder what you think about whether in January will even be able to have an inauguration with the usual celebrations.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't think we will. I don't think we're going to be able to bring large crowds together for an inauguration, we're going to be right in the thick of probably the worst point of this epidemic wave that we're going through right now. And, you know, the-- the Biden campaign, the Biden team, have shown that they're willing to forgo the usual trappings of running for office so that they don't expose people unnecessarily. I suspect they're going to take a similar approach to how they-- how they handle the inauguration. I don't know what that's going to look like, but we're not going to be able to bring together tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people on the lawn in Washington for a typical inauguration.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we've learned that the President's Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, is now COVID positive. He was at the White House gathering just this week when the President addressed the nation on-- on election night. He had access to testing, regular testing. So, I just wonder what the-- the message is for everyday Americans who are thinking about celebrating Thanksgiving, and maybe think that if they get a test beforehand that they're adequately protecting their families. Are they?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: No, they're not. I mean, the tests can help. I think I-- it's prudent to try to get tested if you're going to bring together a group of people. But if you have individuals who are vulnerable in that setting, I think you still need to be very careful if you're going to be exposing younger people in a broader group to older individuals who are vulnerable. If you do do that, make sure they're wearing high quality masks, try to get an N95 mask and have them wear it the whole time. Try to keep people separated and distanced where you can. You know, you need to take a layered approach. Testing alone can't create a safe environment--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --a protective bubble. Even the NHL and the NBA, which had enormous testing, weren't able to use testing alone.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, great to talk to you.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Around the world, there's been some surprising and some not so surprising reaction from world leaders about the new American president. CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from Moscow.\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@HollyMAWilliams): Good morning. Russia state media has portrayed this U.S. election as chaotic and its democracy as flawed. But even inside the Kremlin, they may be looking forward to a more predictable American president.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0WOMAN #1: America has made its choice, but it's choice is a man who rarely leaves his basement, who often doesn't know where he is.\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS: That's RT, often referred to as a Russian propaganda outlet.\u00a0JOE BIDEN: Four more of Georgia. Georgia--\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS: U.S. intelligence concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and U.S. officials warned it was doing the same this year, seeking to denigrate Joe Biden. But political analyst Maria Lipman believes that Russia is disappointed in the Trump administration, in part, for failing to ease sanctions, and may welcome a more conventional president.\u00a0MARIA LIPMAN: He will be more a kind of man of the establishment, not erratic as Donald Trump. And this in itself is an advantage.\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS: There were no warm congratulations from Iran.\u00a0WOMAN #2: Iran's president has called for the return of the next U.S. administration to its obligations.\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS: He hoped the U.S. would now return to the Iran nuclear deal, which President-elect Biden has pledged to do. China's state media has also reveled in America's election turmoil, but its leaders hope that Joe Biden will resolve the trade war started by President Trump.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON (British Prime Minister): I look forward very much to working with President Biden and his team on a lot of crucial stuff for us in the-- in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS: And the mayor of Paris tweeted simply: Welcome back, America.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0HOLLY WILLIAMS: Many of America's allies want to return to U.S. leadership under President-elect Biden, whether it's supporting the World Health Organization or rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Holly Williams in Moscow. Thank you.\u00a0And we turn now to the one and only Bob Schieffer. Got to give you the final word, Bob. It's good to see you and to see you here in person.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER (CBS News Political Contributor): Thank you very much. And I'm-- I'm honored to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, you're always so good at putting things in perspective. How do you sum up this week, this election?\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: We still live in a very divided, deeply divided, country. And I don't think there's-- there's any question of that. Biden won this election fair and square, as far as we know. I think there's no suggestion of any kind of fraud or anything like that, there are these allegations out there. But I-- I think-- I-- I think that will take care of itself. Have-- have the investigations, but I don't think much will come of that. But here's the thing, it's as if President Trump were elected president not of the United States, but of two different countries.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: Two very different countries. And I think the Democrats have to treat the losing side with the utmost respect and dignity because they're going to be there. And Joe Biden is going to need their help as well as the help of Democrats to do what needs to be done in this country. It's-- it's a huge victory from-- for Democrats, but it is not the shellac-- shellacking--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: --of-- of Trumpism that Democrats were hoping for. What-- seventy, seventy-one thousand people voted for Donald Trump. That's a huge number of people out there. And they're going to be part-- they are not going away. The other part is, I don't think Donald Trump is going away. I think he's going to leave the White House, but he's still going to be around. I don't know doing what--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: --but I just don't see him leaving after getting seventy million votes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. With-- with really ardent supporters, too.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President-elect has made the right moves in terms of rhetoric to reach out. He said even just last night, I know what it's like to lose and how hard it is. But how do you actually unite a country where these divisions go so deep?\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, I think you-- you do what-- what Joe Biden has been doing. I think he's been doing pretty much the right thing since this has been decided. He reached out. He said I want to be the president of all of the people, not just the president of the Democrats. And-- and I think it is-- it is important for him to tone down this rhetoric. I mean, not talking about enemies but talking about opponents, talking about how people can have two different points of view. I think what the President-- the President-elect-- and maybe he's already done this-- my guess is he probably has. I think the first thing he needs to do is call Mitch McConnell.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: He knows him. They've been friends for thirty years. I know that Mitch McConnell thinks highly of Joe Biden. Now, I'm not saying call him and then run out and tell everybody on television I just called Mitch McConnell.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: Keep it between themselves. There's got to be-- there got to be things that are good for both Joe Biden and for Mitch McConnell. And if they are, then that's-- that's-- that's good for the country. And-- and I think that's the place to start. How could either of them be hurt by later holding a news conference and saying, we just want everybody to know we're talking.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I love that that's the new benchmark for success, hey, at least they talked. But what-- what do you think-- because the list is so long-- what do you think is the most difficult challenge for the new President?\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: I think just getting people-- he's got to get people in his own party together. They've got to decide on what the priorities are. There's no question COVID has to come first. But he's also got to deal with the-- with this economy. And-- and among other things, why couldn't he come up with the two of them, come up with some sort of a public works plan, where people who can't work in-- in restaurants, because it's dangerous, could work outside in public works projects? I think there are things like that that can be done and are possible.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. For those eleven million people still looking for jobs that just haven't come back. Bob, thank you. So good to see you.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. We won't see you next week. Instead CBS Sports will be broadcasting the Masters, starting at 10:00 AM eastern, but we will see you the Sunday after that.\u00a0For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The match-up between Democrat Mark Kelly and incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona has netted an eye-popping $116 million in ads, including spending from outside groups. In Kelly's quest to take the seat, he has spent $37 million on ads compared to McSally's $18.6 million so far.\u00a0 It's one example of the big spending on ads undertaken by Democratic hopefuls in key battleground states. In some cases, the Democrats have outspent Republican incumbents by as much as 2 to 1.\u00a0 \u00a0 Democrats face a friendlier map than in 2018 and have been gearing up for a battle to take control of a chamber that had been under Republican leadership since 2015. The late inning addition of a Supreme Court vacancy has only added fuel to the fire and cash to their war chests.\u00a0 In North Carolina, a race now upended by both a scandal involving Democrat Cal Cunningham's flirtatious text messages and Republican Senator Thom Tillis testing positive for coronavirus, about $130 million has already been spent on ads and another $35 million at least is expected by Election Day according to tracking by Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group.\u00a0 Cunningham alone has spent nearly $18 million already in comparison to Tillis' just $5.5 million on a race that has them neck-and-neck before word of the scandal broke.\u00a0 It's a two-woman race in Maine, where polls show Senator Susan Collins trailing Democrat Sara Gideon as the Senator campaigns between a rock and a hard place thanks in part to the recent Supreme Court vacancy. Gideon has also spent more than double what Collins has on ads to date with more than $17 million to Collins' less than $8 million. And now Collins is facing an additional challenge. The senator has used her ads to tout her work drafting the Paycheck Protection Program as a part of the CARES Act which delivered relief to thousands of Mainers. But President Trump kneecapped that message this week by encouraging lawmakers to stop further COVID stimulus until after the election. Collins issued a statement Tuesday criticizing the decision.\u00a0 When it comes to Senate campaign spending, Democrat Theresa Greenfield is also dolling out the big bucks in Iowa. She has outspent her Republican opponent, Senator Joni Ernst, by more than $16 million on advertising to date according to Kantar/CMAG. Greenfield has dropped more than $23 million so far; Ernst has dropped less than $8 million. And Greenfield could outspend Ernst by more than $25 million by Election Day in the Hawkeye state. On Thursday, Greenfield announced she had raised $28.7 million from July through September, more than double what she raised this cycle to date so far through June.\u00a0 Even the Senate race in Montana has hit nearly $100 million spent on ads so far. Democratic Governor Steve Bullock is facing off against Senator Steve Daines. Bullock has spent more than $1 million more on ads so far, with $15.1 million to Daines' $13.9 million. By Election Day the race could see more than $125 million spent on ads. Perhaps the biggest surprise this cycle is the Cook Political Report moving South Carolina's Senate race to a toss-up. Democrat Jaime Harrison has spent more than $46 million to date against Senator Lindsey Graham, who has spent just $15.7 million. The once reliably red state could see nearly $100 million in ad spending on the Senate race by November 3 according to Kantar/CMAG tracking. In Colorado, Democrat John Hickenlooper has already outspent Senator Cory Gardner by more than $5 million on ads. In Kentucky, Amy McGrath has outspent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on ads by more than $10 million to date. And in Kentucky, Democrat Barbara Bollier has outspent Republican Roger Marshall $8 million to $2.6 million. Even in Mississippi, Democrat Mike Espy has outspent Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith more than five to one.\u00a0 In the two Senate races taking place simultaneously in Georgia, Democrat Jon Ossoff has outspent his Republican opponent Senator David Perdue by nearly double,\u00a0 but that's not the case for the special election where appointed Senator Kelly Loeffler is facing both Republican and Democratic challengers. Of all the groups investing in the Senate races, the Senate Majority PAC and Senate Leadership Fund are spending the most. Each has already put in more than $100 million toward advertising in races according to Kantar/CMAG. Both are slated to spend upwards of $150 million each by Election Day.\u00a0 The Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC that supports Republicans, has seen record fundraising in 2020, meaning they're also able to spend more than ever before.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic candidates, told CBS News their record breaking fundraising has allowed them to compete deep into the map. \u00a0 Like candidates, the committees on both sides have focused their ads in recent months on health care. For example, in Iowa, groups behind both candidates are hitting opponent plans hard. An ad from the Senate Majority PAC supporting Greenfield highlights that Ernst has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, the Republican PAC Senate Leadership Fund supporting Ernst criticizes Greenfield's support of a public option with some of the same criticism levied against Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for all plan during the Democratic presidential primary in Iowa.\u00a0 This comes as the full picture is still slowly emerging on how much money was raised during the third quarter of 2020. Like Greenfield, Cunningham earlier this month announced raising upwards of $28 million over three months indicating Americans are focused on and donating to Senate races in an unprecedented way. The deadline for Senate campaigns to file with the Federal Election Commission is October 15. CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "When we spoke with Joe Biden this past week in Wilmington, Delaware, the former vice president was ahead in the polls, but confronting a withering final assault from President Trump. As the presidential campaign enters its final full week, we also had questions for his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris.\u00a0 In our conversation, Joe Biden discussed how much he'd be influenced by progressives within his own party, whether his proposed tax increases would hurt the economy, and how he views the current state of the race. Norah O'Donnell: With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, you have held a steady lead in the national and state polls, but so did Hillary Clinton four years ago. Could Donald Trump still win this? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Sure. I'm one of those folks, or competitors, it's not over till the bell rings. And-- I feel superstitious when I predict anything other than gonna be a hard fight. We feel good about where we are. But, you know, I-- I don't underestimate-- how he plays. Norah O'Donnell: What do you mean, you don't underestimate how he plays? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Well, you know, there's an awful lot of talk out there about that-- tryin' to sorta delegitimize the election, all I think designed to make people wonder whether or not they should, whether it's worth going to vote. Just the intimidation factor. But what really has pleased me is the overwhelming turnout in the states that have early voting.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Do you think there are a lot of people who are gonna vote for you simply because you're not Donald Trump? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Well, I hope there's gonna be a lotta people who vote for me because of who I am. But I think the contrast between Donald Trump and me is about as stark as it can get in terms of our value set and-- how we view the world.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: I was listening to one of your podcasts and you said we need some revolutionary, institutional changes. Like what? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Well, for example, I think we have to fundamentally change the way in which we deal with-- institutional racism. For example-- one of the hardest things, beyond police issues, there's the issue of accumulation of wealth. There's an awful lot of Black Americans who are equally as-- they're as qualified as white Americans based on the same status they're in in terms of economic opportunity but they don't get a chance. So, for example, if we just made every corporation pay minimum 15% tax; you got 91 pay no tax. That raises over $400 billion. I can send every single qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150 billion. I can make sure every single person who qualifies community college can go and we still have a lotta money left over. That's what I mean by significant institutional changes. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and others have questioned whether Joe Biden's corporate minimum tax plan would raise as much money as he estimates. After our interview, Mr. Biden's staff told us he misspoke and that the cost of free public college could be twice as much as he said.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: The president made the case at the Republican Convention that your administration would be a Trojan horse for liberals. That AOC, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren would actually be controlling policy, that this would become the most liberal administration in U.S. history. Former Vice President Joe Biden: He'd love to run against them, wouldn't he? Mr. President, you're running against Joe Biden. Joe Biden has a deep, steep, and successful record over a long, long time. But Joe Biden's running mate's record is less widely known. Kamala Harris has represented California in the U.S. Senate for almost four years. Norah O'Donnell: You're very different in the policies that you've supported in the past.\u00a0 You're considered the most liberal United States senator. Senator Kamala Harris: I-- somebody said that and it actually was Mike Pence on the debate stage. (LAUGH) But-- Norah O'Donnell: Yeah. Well, actually, the nonpartisan GovTrack has rated you as the most liberal senator. You supported the Green New Deal, you supported Medicare for All. You've supported legalizing marijuana. Joe Biden doesn't support those things. So are you gonna bring the policies, those progressive policies that you supported as senator, into a Biden administration? Senator Kamala Harris: What I will do, and I promise you this, and this is what Joe wants me to do, this was part of our deal,\u00a0 I will always share with him my lived experience as it relates to any issue that we confront. And I promised Joe that I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him. Norah O'Donnell: And is that a socialist or progressive perspective?\u00a0 Senator Kamala Harris: (LAUGH) No. No. It is the perspective of-- of a woman who grew up-- a Black child in America, who was also a prosecutor, who also has a mother who arrived here at the age of 19 from India. Who also, you know, l-- likes hip hop. (LAUGH) Like, what do you wanna know? (LAUGH) Norah O'Donnell: Well, I wanna give you-- I wanna give you the opportunity to address this because, at the Republican National Convention, President Trump made the case that Joe Biden is gonna be nothing more than a Trojan Horse for socialist policies, for the left wing of the Democratic party. Are you going to push those policies when you're vice president of-- Senator Kamala Harris: I am not-- Norah O'Donnell: --of the United States? Senator Kamala Harris: --gonna be confined to Donald Trump's definition of who I or anybody else is. And I think America has learned that that would be a mistake.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: So just-- just to button that up, because you have fought for Medicare for All. That's not something that Joe Biden supports. If you become vice president, would you say to a President Biden, \"You know what? Let's-- we should really be pushing for Medicare for All, not a public option. That's just not gonna do it. That's not my value\"? Senator Kamala Harris: I would not have joined the ticket if I didn't support what Joe was proposing. And so our plan includes expanding on everything that Joe together with President Obama created with the Affordable Care Act. By contrast, you have Donald Trump, who's in Court right now trying to get rid of a policy that brought health care to over 20 million people, including protecting people with preexisting conditions. And he's doing it in the middle of a pandemic that has killed over 215,000 Americans. Norah O'Donnell: What do you think is the biggest domestic issue America faces? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Right now, the biggest domestic issue is our health. Right now, COVID. COVID, the way he's handling COVID is just absolutely totally irresponsible. He's telling people that we've turned the bend, in one of his recent rallies. Well, he's gone-- as my grandpop would say, he's gone 'round the bend. I mean, we are in real trouble.\u00a0 Mr. Biden says he would spend up to $200 billion to make sure schools have the equipment and staff they need to re-open safely. He also says he'd make greater use of the Defense Production Act to manufacture and distribute millions of testing kits for COVID-19. Former Vice President Joe Biden: We should be investigating a great deal more money in testing and tracing. A woman can go in and-- to a drugstore and buy a pregnancy test, and find out at home whether or not she's pregnant. We should be doing the same kind of investment to see whether we're gonna have testing kits for people to know. It's not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID. Norah O'Donnell: But Congress did approve that money for the NIH. Former Vice President Joe Biden: No, that's my-- Norah O'Donnell: You're saying it's-- Former Vice President Joe Biden: --point, but it's not there. But they haven't done it. They haven't done it.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: People are worried about a national lockdown, and worried about jobs. The president's advisor now is Dr. Scott Atlas. He is advocating\u00a0 young people go about their business and older people sequester. Former Vice President Joe Biden: Nobody thinks he makes any sense. Nobody, no serious doc around the world.\u00a0 \u00a0Norah O'Donnell: But how do you not lock down the economy? Former Vice President Joe Biden: You don't have to lock down the economy. It depends on the community. It depends on where it's real-- in real trouble. And you have to do things that make sense, that make it easier for people to avoid being exposed. Freedom is about making sure that you care about the people you're around, that they be free too. It's a patriotism to put this mask on.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Let's talk about the economy. Former Vice President Joe Biden: Yes. Norah O'Donnell: You are proposing several trillion dollars in new spending over the next decade for economic relief, education, health care. How are you gonna pay for that? Former Vice President Joe Biden: By righting the tax code. You got billionaires in this country making $700 billion during this crisis. $700 billion. The former vice president has pledged to undo the Trump tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. He'd raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. He'd also raise taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year, and the top rate would be 39.6%. Former Vice President Joe Biden:\u00a0 nobody making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in tax under my proposal. Norah O'Donnell: That's a promise? Former Vice President Joe Biden: That's a guarantee, a promise. I give you my word as a Biden. That's an absolute guarantee. Norah O'Donnell: You think it's a good idea to raise taxes when the economy's in dire straits? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Depending who you're raising them on. Look, if you're raising 'em on somebody who's makin' $1 billion a year, it's not a problem that they pay 39.6%, which everybody should pay, raise another $90 billion. Norah O'Donnell: The president says that's gonna end up sending jobs overseas. Former Vice President Joe Biden: He's sending 'em overseas already. Take a look at what's happened. We have a trade deficit that's larger with China than when we were there. \u00a0 Actually, that depends on how you calculate it. The overall trade deficit with China was slightly lower in 2019 than it was during the last three years of the Obama administration. The Biden and Trump campaigns have been engaged in a running battle over who will be tougher on China. Norah O'Donnell: Let's turn to foreign policy. What do you think is the biggest foreign threat that America faces? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Our lack of standing in the world. Look what he does. He embraces every dictator in sight, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all of our friends. And so what's happening now is you have-- you have the situation in Korea where they have more lethal missiles and they have more capacity than they had before. Norah O'Donnell: North Korea? Former Vice President Joe Biden: North Korea. You have a situation in the Gulf where you have Iran closer to a nu-- having enough fissile material to get a nuclear weapon than they had before. You have our NATO allies backing away from us because they say, \"We can't count on,\" us. So he's moving away from what has allowed us to bring the world together. Norah O'Donnell: Which country is the biggest threat to America? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Well, I think the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our-- our security and our alliances is Russia. Secondly, I think that the biggest competitor is China. And depending on how we handle that will determine whether we're competitors or we end up being in a more serious competition relating to force.\u00a0 Domestically, Democrats have lost the competition to control the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Biden is under pressure from his own party to consider increasing the number of justices if elected.\u00a0 It's called court-packing, and while he's said he's no fan of the idea, he's never completely ruled it out. Norah O'Donnell: Judge Amy Coney Barrett is on track to become the ninth U.S. Supreme Court justice. That would give the conservatives a six-three majority. If elected, would you move to add more justices to the Supreme Court? Former Vice President Joe Biden: If elected, what I will do is I'll put together a national commission of, bipartisan commission of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative. And I will-- ask them to over-- 180 days come back to me with recommendations as to how to-- reform the court system because it's getting out of whack-- the way in which it's being handled and it's not about court packing. There's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I'd look to see what recommendations that commission might make. Norah O'Donnell: This is a live ball? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Oh, it is a live ball. No, it is a live ball. We're gonna have to do that. And you're gonna find there's a lotta conservative constitutional scholars who are saying it as well. The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations. In the closing days of the campaign, Joe Biden has been forced to address new and unverified claims that he was involved in his son Hunter's foreign business dealings. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, says he came into possession of emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden and turned them over to the tabloid New York Post. Mr. Trump and his allies have called for an investigation but the FBI would neither confirm nor deny to 60 Minutes that one was taking place. Norah O'Donnell: Do you believe the recent leak of material allegedly from Hunter's computer is part of a Russian disinformation campaign? Former Vice President Joe Biden: From what I've read and know the intelligence community warned the president that Giuliani was being fed disinformation from the Russians. And we also know that Putin is trying very hard to spread disinformation about Joe Biden. And so when you put the combination of Russia, Giuliani-- the president, together-- it's just what it is. It's a smear campaign because he has nothing he wants to talk about. What is he running on? What is he running on? On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump paints former Vice President Joe Biden as an aging career politician and questions his mental acuity. This past Monday, in our conversation, Mr. Biden frankly discussed his age, his health, and why he believes Kamala Harris stands ready to become president if necessary. Norah O'Donnell: If elected, you would be the oldest president in American history. Former Vice President Joe Biden: I'm in good shape. Norah O'Donnell: 78 years old. 82 after four years. Donald Trump says you have dementia and it's getting worse. Former Vice President Joe Biden: Hey, the same guy who thought that the 9/11 attack was a 7-Eleven attack. He's talkin' about dementia? All I can say to the American people is watch me, is see what I've done, is see what I'm gonna do. Look at me. Compare our physical and mental acuity. I'm happy to have that comparison.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Your age makes the choice of your vice president all the more important. Why do you think Senator Harris would be ready to step in and become commander-in-chief if something were to happen to you? Former Vice President Joe Biden: Number one: her values. Number two: She is smart as a devil. Number three: She has a backbone like a ramrod. Number four: She is really principled. And number five: She is-- has had significant experience\u00a0 in the largest state in the union, running a Justice Department that's only second in size to the United States Justice Department. And-- you know obviously I-- I hope that never becomes a question. Kamala Harris was the first woman and first Black person to be district attorney of San Francisco, And attorney general of California. And she's only the second Black woman to serve in the United States Senate.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Do you think having the first woman of color, the first woman, as vice president may change things? Senator Kamala Harris: I do. It helps change the perception of who can do what because that is still part of the battle after all. And you imagine some young person then seeing, \"Oh, things can be different. I don't have to conform to whatever I'm-- you know, supposed to do or relegated to do. I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been,\" you know? Norah O'Donnell: What kinda role do you think you would play in a Biden administration? Senator Kamala Harris: Joe Biden's partner. One of the first things he said was, \"I want you to be the first person in the room and the last person in the room.\" Norah O'Donnell: How often do you and Joe Biden speak? Senator Kamala Harris: Almost every day. From the moment Joe Biden selected her as his running-mate, Senator Harris has become one of President Trump's favorite targets. Norah O'Donnell: On the campaign trail, President Trump has attacked you frequently. He's called you a monster. He's said you're nasty and it would be an insult to our country if you became the first female president. Do you see this as just the rough and tumble of politics, or do you view those attacks against you as racist? Senator Kamala Harris: Well, this is not the first time in my life I've been called names and it-- you know, it was predictable, sadly. Norah O'Donnell: Do you think the president is racist? Senator Kamala Harris: Yes, I do. (LAUGH) Yeah. I do. You can look at a pattern that goes back to him questioning the identity of the first Black president of the United States. You can look at Charlottesville, when there were peaceful protesters, And on the other side, Neo-Nazis\u00a0 and he talks about fine people on either side.\u00a0 Calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. His first order of business was to institute a Muslim ban. It all speaks for itself. President Trump has said he denounces racism and white supremacy. After the Black Lives Matter protests that began this summer, the president tried to frame the election as a choice between law and order and Biden and Harris. Norah O'Donnell: There's a sense that there's a divide out there, that in order to address systemic racism that it's anti-police, that you would not be a law and order president. Former Vice President Joe Biden: Well, let me put it this way. Number one: I've never, ever supported defunding police. Matter of fact, we need to give more funding for police for different reasons. Number two: Any use of violence, burning down stores, smashing windows, that is a crime. People should be arrested. No justification for it. There's never been a conflict with me between law and order and dignity; they're one and the same. Norah O'Donnell: The president said on the stump, \"I saved the suburbs. You should-- you should thank me.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden: He wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn. Go out in the suburbs now. It's not 1950. There are Black and white families living next door to one another, drivin' each other's kids to soccer practice.\u00a0 this is a different world than he lives in. Look, there's a lotta reasons people are upset. A lotta good reasons. All he wants to do is take that sort of subliminal fear out there and say, \"It's because-- 'cause of that guy, or because of that woman.\" That's not who we are as a country. I w-- I mean, this is not who we are. It's not our value system. You know, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\" We've never met it. We've never met the standard, but we've always gone further and further and further towards-- inclusion. This is the first president who's trying to shut it down. We cannot sustain this democracy that way. We're so much better than this. Produced by Andy Court and Keith Sharman. Associate producers, Evie Salomon and Sheena Samu.

            "article_content": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court signaled on Tuesday night that it's unlikely to rule on the case that could remove tens of thousands of people from the state's voter rolls before the November election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 The court agreed to hear the case earlier in June and rejected a request from the plaintiffs, in a 5-2 decision, to decide the case based on briefs or expedited oral arguments. The court said oral arguments would follow the normal schedule and will not occur before September 29. That would make it difficult for the court to rule in the case before the presidential election. The case stems from a letter sent in October 2019 to about 230,000 voters from the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) indicating officials believed those people may have moved from their current address. A conservative legal group filed a lawsuit last year asking the WEC to remove the voters who had not responded to the mailing about their address within 30 days. Since the letter was initially sent, thousands of voters have confirmed their address or have been deemed ineligible. As of early June, that left about 129,000 voters in question. In her dissenting opinion, conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley said the court should hear oral arguments in August and decide the case before the November election, saying it's unlikely to do so under the current timeline. \"Justice for the people of Wisconsin means deciding this case expeditiously for the citizens of Wisconsin in order to ensure the integrity of Wisconsin's elections going forward,\" Bradley wrote. Conservatives hold a 5-2 majority right now but will have a 4-3 majority when they hear this case. Judge Jill Karofsky, a liberal, takes the bench in August to replace conservative Justice Daniel Kelly, who joined Bradley's dissent supporting expedited oral arguments. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN \"We worked for W. We support Joe\" is the banner for Joe Biden's latest coalition of supporters: former alumni of President George W. Bush's White House,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \"Together, we can help restore decency, honor, dignity, and true leadership to the White House,\" the group's\u00a0website\u00a0boasts. More than adding their vocal support, the group also has set up a super PAC to boost their message of bipartisan support for Biden.\u00a0 \"We endorse Vice President Biden not necessarily in opposition to any political affiliations, but rather in service to our country which requires a greater obligation than partisan politics or party,\" they add. On the other side of the aisle, MoveOn, a progressive outreach organization, also endorsed Biden today. The last presidential candidate the organization supported was Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential primary against Hillary Clinton, signaling potential pick-ups from liberals who view Biden as too moderate. Before that the group supported then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008 and his reelection in 2012.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP President Trump's reelection campaign announced it raised a record-breaking combined total of $131 million in the month of June, along with the Republican National Committee and joint fundraising committees and maintains a massive cash war chest heading into the summer with over $295 million in the bank, according to CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga and CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the campaign, the entities brought in an average of $4.3 million a day. Last month, Mr. Trump's re-election team also announced it had smashed its single-day fundraising record across all GOP committees, bringing in $14 million on Mr. Trump's birthday, June 14th. \"The Trump campaign's monumental June fundraising haul proves that people are voting with their wallets and that enthusiasm behind President Trump's re-election is only growing,\" said Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale, in a statement Wednesday. According to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group tracking, the Trump campaign spent $34 million on ads in June alone including television ads predominantly in battleground states but also in states including Iowa and Georgia. \u00a0 Tracking also shows the campaign has already reserved nearly $100 million television ads for local broadcast and cable in six battleground states including $37 million in Florida, $18 million in Ohio, $16.5 million in North Carolina, more than $14.5 million in Pennsylvania, $7 million in Wisconsin and just over $5 million in Arizona. Read more here. President Trump's reelection campaign is\u00a0moving chief operating officer Michael Glassner\u00a0to spearhead legal affairs in the four-month homestretch to November's general election. His new role comes as Mr. Trump's approval numbers have taken a tumble and the president's first rally in three months attracted a smaller crowd than expected,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 The Tulsa event, in a heavily Republican area of the country where Mr. Trump is very popular, drew just over 6,200 guests, according to the Tulsa Fire Marshall's office, falling far short of the \"1 million RSVPs\" touted by the Trump campaign. Last month, senior adviser to the Trump campaign Jared Kushner and campaign manager Brad Parscale both pointed out to Mr. Trump that they are not \"strategists,\" amid concerns the campaign lacks an overall reelection strategy, sources familiar tell CBS News. But it was Glassner \u2014 a longtime Trump ally and original member of the president's 2016 shoestring primary bid \u2014 who took the fall, since he plays a significant role in coordinating rally logistics.\u00a0 Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh defended the timing of Glassner's reassignment. \"This is not a reaction to Tulsa. Michael Glassner is moving into the long-term role of navigating the many legal courses we face, including suits against major media outlets, some of which will likely extend beyond the end of the campaign,\" Murtaugh said in a statement to CBS News.\u00a0 Jeff DeWitt, the president's 2016 Arizona chair, will replace Glassner as chief operating officer while the campaign rethinks its own mega-events in the run up to Election Day, hoping to avoid the embarrassment of another sparsely filled venue. \u00a0DeWit, a Republican who earlier this year departed\u00a0a top position at NASA\u00a0and recently headed an app developer\u00a0pitched as\u00a0\"the Solution to Big Tech Suppression,\" once\u00a0reportedly turned down\u00a0a personal plea from Trump in 2015 to primary then-Sen. John McCain, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. A longtime top ally to DeWit, former Arizona deputy treasurer Sean Dollman, already serves as operations director\u00a0for the campaign. VEEPSTAKES ELIZABETH WARREN Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging Vice President Mike Pence, the chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to revamp the federal response to the pandemic. In a letter to Pence Wednesday, Warren argued Dr. Anthony Fauci's admission to her in a Senate hearing that the United States could reach up to 100,000 COVID-19 cases a day showed the White House had mismanaged the pandemic and obscured the reality of it. \u00a0 \"Either you do not have the slightest comprehension of the scope, causes, and risks from the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak in the United States, or you are deliberately attempting to mislead the American public about the scale of the outbreak,\" Warren wrote, pointing to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0op-ed\u00a0Pence penned in mid-June that downplayed concerns of a coming second wave of the virus. In the letter,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports Warren wrote that the federal government had already failed to adequately expand testing and contact tracing and that Pence and President Trump have sent Americans mixed messages on mask wearing and social distancing. She asked Pence to explain what the administration is doing to prepare the country for up to 100,000 new cases of the virus per day. \"The pandemic and its human and economic costs grow daily because of the Administration's failed response,\" she wrote. \"I once again, implore you to take action to ramp up testing, secure the supply chain, enforce and encourage public health measures, and bolster contact tracing efforts.\" STATE-BY-STATE ARIZONA While Democrats in Arizona are ramping up their team ahead of the final stretch to the general election, CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports state party Chair Felecia Rotellini\u00a0said Wednesday\u00a0that their organizing would remain virtual as coronavirus\u00a0cases have surged to\u00a0record highs in the state.\u00a0 \"We will be able to do door knocking when it's safe. And when we aren't jeopardizing the safety and health of both our field organizers and our volunteers and the folks whose homes we knock on their door,\" Rotellini told reporters\u00a0on a conference call\u00a0ahead of Pence's visit to the state today. Meanwhile, after pausing on-the-ground campaigning earlier this year, Republicans in Arizona have touted face masks as they resume\u00a0in-person canvassing.\u00a0 The campaign recently declared it had made \"its two millionth voter contact\" of the cycle in Arizona. MICHIGAN The Detroit Pistons announced on Wednesday that they will be jumping into the 2020 election to offer their training facility as a voting \"satellite center\" in November, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The facility will be used for voter registration and in-person voting during the general election. The announcement comes after the Atlanta Hawks announced on Monday that they were partnering with Fulton County to create Georgia's largest voting precinct for the August runoff and November general elections at their arena. The Hawks also said that hundreds of team and arena employees will be trained to serve as election workers. The Pistons will be giving employees a paid day off and are working with election officials for an employee volunteer program to work the polls. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE Four freshman Congresswomen are creating a new, joint progressive fundraising committee. \u00a0Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib launched the Squad Victory Fund Wednesday, reports\u00a0CBS News Correspondent Nikole Killion. The committee will support their re-election campaigns, leadership PACs and provide resources to mobilize a broad, grassroots movement across the country. \"The progressive policies that my sisters and I are fighting for \u2013 Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, an end to mass incarceration \u2013 have never been more important. The Squad Victory Fund will help us fight back,\" said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. The Democratic lawmakers also announced their endorsements of one another for 2020. Last month, Ocasio-Cortez fended off a challenge to her New York district seat. Omar and Tlaib face primary opponents this summer in Minnesota and Michigan. IN THE SENATE Former Governor John Hickenlooper won Colorado's Democratic Senate primary Tuesday night and will take on GOP Senator Cory Gardner in November, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The former governor and brief 2020 presidential candidate prevailed over former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff after a month full of attacks on Hickenlooper from both Republicans and progressive Democrats. In a remarks on his Facebook page after winning the primary, Hickenlooper said he spoke to Romanoff who offered him his full support. Colorado is one of the top targets for Democrats in the fall to flip the Senate. The Cook Political Report rates\u00a0the seat as a toss-up. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin that aired Sunday, November 8, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who joins us from Charleston, West Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0 SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Morning, MARGARET, how are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I'm doing well. I wonder if you agree with your Democratic colleague, Congressman Richmond, who said this was a wakeup call to senators this election, that it is a different day. Do you agree? And what should the president-elect's first order of business be? SEN. MANCHIN: Well, basically, Joe Biden has said he's going to be a president for all of us, and that's exactly what he has to do, bring us all together, bringing Democrats and Republicans together, because it is a wakeup call for all of us. The country is more divided now than any time in our history or basically any time since the Civil War, as far as I can see. And we don't want to go back to those days, so we have to come together. Joe Biden got elected in a very, very contested primary, and all the nuances that were thrown on the Democratic Party is not who we are. He was not for any of this stuff- and I think Jim Clyburn said it best, that was an albatross around us. Basically labeling every Democrat as a socialist or supporting socialism, that's not who we are. It's not who I am is not how we were raised. And it hurt a lot of good Democrats in rural America, Montana, for one. Other places around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, President Trump says he's fighting for the forgotten men and women, and he seems to define that as non-college educated whites. 80 percent of the workforce in your state lacks a four-year college degree. It went ruby red for President Trump. Why didn't the Democratic Party's message break through? SEN. MANCHIN: Well, it was a- it wasn't a good message. I mean, we let them tag us before basically we could remind the people who we are, but we didn't have a good message. I'll be very honest with you, MARGARET. Here's the thing, four years ago in rural America, in America in general, voted for Donald Trump because Democrats were mad, Independents were mad. They thought they'd been left behind. And I always said this, West Virginians felt like they were a returning Vietnam veterans. We did everything this country asked and now we weren't good enough or you left us behind. There was no pathway forward. So they voted in record numbers. They went from being mad to being scared in 2020. They were scared of this socialism that was thrown out there by a radical part of the so-called left that was throwing all this out, that basically scared the bejesus out of people and that hung on and hung on strongly. And it's not who we are. It is not who we are and it's not what we're about. And I have fought against that. Joe Biden has fought against that. We're not for New Green Deal. We're not for all the things that he's talked about, Medicare for all. We can't even pay for Medicare for some. We've got to take care of a lot of things. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about that, because there- I understand who- who you say Democrats are. But obviously there isn't a lot of agreement at this point within the party. Your Republican colleague, Mitt Romney said, \"This election shows conservative principles are on the ascendency. Americans don't want to get rid of coal or gas. They don't want Medicare for all.\" You just said that The Green New Deal is not something that people want there. There's a whole lot of fracking, I understand, in West Virginia and a whole lot of coal. But did the president-elect's energy message hurt him? Is that also what you're saying? It's not just socialism, that it's what Joe Biden said. SEN. MANCHIN: What Joe Biden said, and what Joe Biden's bill is, the Biden energy plan- and we're working with that- is going to be an all-inclusive. You need all of the energy. First and foremost, you must be energy independent. To have the most powerful nation on earth we can't be dependent on foreign- on any foreigners- foreign countries for our energy sources. So that means we're going to use coal and we're going to use gas and we're going to use oil and we're going to be able to- to use our renewables and be able to develop the fuels of the future. But we're going to do it in the cleanest fashion. I believe in innovation, not elimination. And we've talked about this and what was said and what we're going to do is two different things. And it did come across wrong, and it was very difficult. But that didn't help at all. But I can tell you, Joe Biden is not against fracking. Fracking can be done. And we do it every day in West Virginia and do it in the safest manner. We capture the methane. We don't let it escape into the air and all these things can be done better. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you what can actually get through because it seems in early reporting, the Biden camp will have to rely on a lot of executive orders, particularly if the Republicans hold on to the Senate as they appear poised to do. That would make it hard for him to repeal, for example, the Trump tax cuts. That would make it hard for him to repeal liability protections for gun manufacturers. I mean, is the message from this election that Democrats need to be moderate? SEN. MANCHIN: Oh, I've always been moderate. I would- I would- I would encourage all Democrats to be moderate, find the middle if you can. We're not going to be able to govern from the extremes or from the fringes. Never have been. But when you're talking about the things you are- fiscal responsibility wasn't even spoken about in this election, not in- our side. And Republicans- we piled on more debt in four years- in the last four years, more debt at a faster rate than any time since World War II. Someone should be concerned about that. So I believe I- I say- I've always said I'm fiscally responsible and socially compassionate. I believe most Americans are, my moderate Republican friends and the moderate Democrats. We've got to govern from that middle, that moderate middle. Joe Biden has always been there. He knows how to work across the aisle. He'll reach out first and make this Senate work and give it every chance he can. And I can assure you, there are my Republican friends that are concerned about this runaway debt. They want to make sure that we're able to do it in a fiscally responsible way. So you'll be surprised. There'll be more and more crossing over wanting to work in a more moderate, moderate Senate. I really believe that. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll see if that happens. Thank you very much, Senator Manchin. And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "As U.S. cases of COVID-19 surge, filling up hospitals\u00a0and setting new records, Republicans are tiptoeing around the pandemic on national and local airwaves. A review of the top issues addressed in television advertising in 11 battleground states reveals coronavirus ranked as one of the top five issues in GOP ads in only two states in the presidential race from September 1 through October 24. Over 228,000 people have died in the U.S. from COVID-19, and there were 88,000 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday. According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 8.9 million cases nationwide.\u00a0 And yet, the coronavirus is a top-five issue in Republican ads in only two states, Michigan and Minnesota, according to a review of TV ads by Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group. There have been more than 167,500 cases of COVID-19 and more than 7,250 deaths in Michigan, while in Minnesota, there have been more than 142,000 cases and 2,400 deaths.\u00a0 In Michigan, just under a third of Republican ad spending \u2014 32% \u2014 in nearly eight weeks mentioned the pandemic. The top Republican TV ad messaging there was pro-Trump, which was included in 99% of ad spending. This comes as the most recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll shows more likely Michigan voters believe President Trump set a bad example in his own battle earlier this month with COVID-19:\u00a0 41% said he handled it responsibility, while 59% said his handling of it was irresponsible. Meanwhile in Minnesota, coronavirus appeared in 34% of GOP ad spending. Here, Republican ads in the state are emphasizing anti-Biden messaging, which was on display in 98% of Republican ads over eight weeks.\u00a0 \"Biden's plan means higher taxes on all income groups,\" claims the narrator in an ad aired in the state by the pro-Trump Super PAC America First Action.\u00a0 The pandemic also isn't rating among the top five issues Republicans are investing in on national network or cable advertising either.\u00a0 \"There's no credible message there when it comes to Trump on COVID,\" said Republican strategist Rob Stutzman about the lack of Republican coronavirus messaging in the presidential race. \"Down ballot they can talk about their votes and what they did, but Trump doesn't have that. There's no narrative there.\" On Wednesday, the Republican National Committee poured another $9 million into its existing $14 million ad buy targeting senior citizens in Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. \"Attention, fellow seniors: This election will determine your Medicare premiums,\" one ad declares, before falsely accusing the Biden-Harris campaign of eliminating private insurance plans. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is highlighting the president's handling of the economy during commercial breaks. While Republicans are keeping their distance from COVID in their ads for the presidential race, Democrats have been leaning in hard on coronavirus TV messaging. The virus is a top-five issue in every one of the 11 states reviewed: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.\u00a0 \"You know what real leadership looks like? For Joe Biden it means listening to experts,\" says the narrator in an ad by Future Forward PAC, with an image of Dr. Fauci in it. More than $135.6 million was spent on messaging mentioning the pandemic, and in eight of the states, 50% of all Democrats' TV ad spending in the presidential race included coronavirus messaging from the start of September through October 24. In Michigan and Minnesota, it was upwards of 64%. COVID-19 was also a major issue for Democrats in national cable and network TV ads. The Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA is one of the biggest outside spenders in the presidential race on TV advertising in the general election. It's been running ads on the pandemic since the spring and its data in six battleground states continues to find voters trust Biden over Trump on dealing with the coronavirus. \"Bad public health policy is bad politics and voters are on to this,\" said Guy Cecil on Wednesday. \"They understand that coronavirus cases are rising. They hold the president responsible for it.\" The Biden campaign reflects Democratic coronavirus messaging on the airwaves during in-person stops on the campaign trail, staging socially distanced campaign gatherings and CDC-friendly \"drive in\" rallies. On Wednesday, the former vice president appeared in front of large graphs depicting COVID hospitalizations and warned the cases of COVID will be a \"bigger wave of anything we've experienced to date.\" Despite his opponents' attacks and the GOP's avoidance of COVID-19 messaging, the president's campaign hasn't completely been silent on the pandemic in its ads. In one ad first aired in mid-October, the narrator claimed, \"President Trump is leading, attacking the virus head-on,\" and an earlier ad touted the president's recovery from COVID-19.\u00a0 On the campaign trail, the president rejects the reality of a COVID-19 uptick, dismissing it as a \"fake news media conspiracy.\"\u00a0 \"COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID...,\" Trump remarked to supporters gathered in Lansing, Michigan, Tuesday. \"We have a spike in cases. Do you ever notice they don't use the word 'death?' They use the word 'cases.'\" The president reprised misleading claims that increased testing has led to increased case numbers. \"We're testing everybody. In many ways, I hate it.\" While testing more people does identify more cases, rates of positive tests are rising even faster. Experts say the surging numbers being seen in many states are due to an increase in illnesses, rather than an increase in testing, and hospitals are filling up with COVID-19 patients.\u00a0 \"A safe vaccine is coming very quickly,\" Mr. Trump vowed Wednesday in Bullhead City, Arizona. \"You are going to have it momentarily,\" he vowed, although pharmaceutical companies and the nation's leading doctors have offered no such guarantees.\u00a0 Bo Erickson contributed to this report.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's trip to Omaha on Tuesday is a direct play for the single electoral college vote in Nebraska's 2nd District. Nebraska is only one of two states, the other being Maine, to split electoral college votes among congressional districts. And while a Democrat hasn't won here since Barack Obama in 2008, Mr. Trump only won it by 2 points in 2016. The competitive nature of the urban-suburban area could make the district decisive in the case of a 269-269 electoral college tie or with a tight 270-269 win; both are possible scenarios if Biden only flips a handful of states while President Trump keeps some combination of Florida and Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. University of Nebraska Omaha Professor Jody Neathery-Castro told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that while a tie in the electoral college has \"probably crossed everybody's minds as a possibility...it would have be a perfect kind of alignment of the rest of the country in terms of electoral votes.\" The scenario has crossed the mind of Republican Don Bacon, a sophomore Congressman who is facing his own tight re-election. \"The urban suburban districts have been more of a challenge for President Trump and the GOP, so this district is truly up for grabs,\" he told\u00a0Navarro. The latest\u00a0Siena College/New York Times\u00a0poll shows Joe Biden up by 7 points here, though both campaigns have been increasing their activity in the district. Kamala Harris appeared on Omaha's\u00a0ABC station Wednesday night\u00a0and called the Nebraska's 2nd \"critical\" to winning the White House. Biden will be campaigning in nearby Iowa on Friday. Prior to the president's rally, Donald Trump Jr. and Lara Trump have also served as trail surrogates in recent weeks. The individual campaigns have spent more than a combined $3.2 million on ads in the state, with Biden's campaign making their highest purchases in the last two weeks according to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group ad tracking data. \"I hope he talks about a lot of the results,\" Bacon said ahead of President Trump's speech. \"I think that's what persuades Nebraskans. They want to hear about results, they're not into the name calling or the elbow throwing but they want to be persuaded by results.\" Bacon's opponent, Democrat Kara Eastman, criticized the two for even holding a rally in the first place while the area sees a spike in coronavirus cases. \"It just looks as if they are not taking this fight seriously and that they've abandoned fighting this pandemic and instead are furthering its spread with unsafe and an unfortunate rally happening today in Omaha,\" she said during a press conference Tuesday. Their race is one of the most competitive House races in the country, with either Bacon or Eastman leading within the margin of error in\u00a0recent polls\u00a0and more than $11.2 million in\u00a0outside spending. It's also a rematch of 2018, when Bacon beat Eastman by just two points. When asked about what's changed since 2018 to give her an edge, Eastman pointed to a smaller party registration gap, demographic shifts as well as the president's record in office. \"People here have had four years to see both Donald J. Bacon and Donald J. Trump in action,\" she said. \"Some people who voted for Trump thought they would see something different in Washington, D.C., that the swamp would be drained. I think they feel let down - the swamp is more populated than it's ever been.\" Throughout the cycle, Eastman and\u00a0Democrats\u00a0have consistently looked to tie Bacon to Mr. Trump and Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Eastman, who is backed by Biden, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the progressive Justice Democrats group, has also portrayed herself as an independent Democrat voice in a potential Biden administration. \"Biden has my full support. We don't agree on everything but I believe that Nebraskans deserve an independent leader, somebody who's going to stand up and fight for them,\" she said. Bacon and\u00a0Republicans\u00a0associate Eastman with \"far left\" progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Ilhan Omar, who is participating in a phone bank with Eastman this Thursday. He cited his polling going up since their first debate and his endorsement from Blue Dog Democrats like former Congressman Brad Ashford, who Bacon unseated in 2016 and Eastman beat in the 2018 primary, as a reason he's the more moderate candidate. \"My opponent is a sort of unabashed Bernie-ite, if you will. And I don't think that plays well in the district,\" he said. \"I feel like I have my own identity here as well. The national direction makes a difference. You can't avoid that. But I also have my own identity, my own set of accomplishments.\" Both candidates point to the more than 110,000 registered independents as a crucial voting group for any path of victory in the district. Professor Neathery-Castro said a fluid suburban bloc will be impactful in that. \"The rhetoric that you see here suggests that suburban voters are not being moved by the Trump appeal in this election. I'm really interested to see how that plays out,\" she said. Douglas County Republican Chair Theresa Thibodeau agreed that while she's seen shifts to left amongst the suburban women bloc during Mr. Trump's tenure, she's confident they'll vote Republican this cycle. \"As far as the rhetoric goes, not all of us agree with how he delivers his message. However we do look at his effectiveness -- and he has delivered on his promises,\" she said about the president. Democrats sounded the alarm on mail-in voting Tuesday, urging their constituents to hand deliver ballots a week before Election Day in the wake of\u00a0Wisconsin's Supreme Court decision Monday night. The divided bench voted against reinstating an order by a Wisconsin federal court judge that said absentee ballots could be counted if received within six days after the election as long as they were postmarked by Election Day,\u00a0CBS News reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports. \"We're in full-court press for the final seven days, encouraging people to vote early, vote in person. If you have an absentee ballot, deliver it in person to a drop box or to your clerk. Don't rely on the Postal Service to get it there by 8 o'clock, next Tuesday,\" Congressman Ron Kind (WI-3) told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, Tuesday. In Lansing, Michigan on Tuesday, President Trump predicted a \"red wave\" would descend on polling locations on Election Day. \"The red wave. Generally speaking, you go, if not Tuesday, Monday,\" Mr. Trump remarked, before taking an informal poll of supporters. \"How many people have already voted? All right, good. You are sort of a late state. That's good.\" Michigan has seen a record-breaking 2.2 million ballots returned so far, according to the\u00a0U.S. Elections project. The same tracker shows nearly 1.3 million Democrats have returned absentee ballots in battleground Pennsylvania, while Republicans have returned just under 400,000. \"We know that the vast majority of the president's voters will be voting on Election Day,\" Trump communications director Tim Murtaugh said Tuesday, adding, \"The president's Election Day vote and his vote turnout will carry the day because the Democrats have not opened up a large enough lead. That holds in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina and Florida.\" Rep. Mark Kelly (PA-16) told CBS News, \"The assumption that every Democrat that mailed in an early ballot, it was a vote for Joe Biden, I think that is way off the mark.\" Murtaugh also claimed the Trump campaign's internal modeling shows the president ahead in \"every single battleground state that allows early voting in person, across the board.\" But\u00a0public data\u00a0shows Democrats hold a slight edge against Republicans among in-person early voters in battleground North Carolina (37.5%-33.9%.) Meanwhile, COVID-19 upticks have once again put the president on defense. \"COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID,\" Trump remarked to supporters gathered in Lansing, MI. \"We have a spike in cases. Do you ever notice they don't use the word death? They use the word cases.\" The president reprised\u00a0misleading claims\u00a0that increased testing has led to increased case numbers. \"We're testing everybody. In many ways, I hate it. In many ways, I hate it.\" While testing more people does identify more cases, rates of positive tests are rising even faster,\u00a0CBS News digital editor Nicole Brown\u00a0reports. Experts say the\u00a0surging numbers\u00a0being seen in many states are due to an actual increase in illnesses, and\u00a0hospitals are filling up\u00a0with COVID-19 patients. Days away from Election Day,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports 82 out of Ohio's 88 counties are now high incidence counties, meaning that there are more than 100 cases per 100,000 residents in the last two weeks. Vice President Pence also had three campaign rallies scheduled today, two in North Carolina and one in South Carolina. The vice president's team says he is taking extra precautions on the road after five of his close aides tested positive for the coronavirus last week. Pence is traveling with a smaller team, tested daily, and will only do outdoor events in the final few days. The VP has also cut out visiting the ropeline after speeches and will no longer do local interviews like he used to on a regular basis, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Today in Greensboro, Pence said North Carolina \"always plays an outsized role in the choice of our national leadership,\" especially this year. He spent a good amount of his speech today talking about the economy. He focused on manufacturing jobs, support for farmers and ranchers, and lauded the USMCA as a great deal for North Carolina and America. He said Kamala Harris put her own climate agenda ahead of the workers of NC by voting against the USMCA. Pence also talked about the third-quarter GDP numbers that are expected to be released on Thursday. \"I don't know what they are but buckle up,\" Pence said of the GDP numbers. \"You're going to see American resilience like you have never seen before.\" Though Pence mentioned the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank estimated a 35% increase in the GDP for this quarter, economists are warning that the\u00a0flash numbers could be misleading\u00a0in the middle of the pandemic. \"This economy, you're going to see it this week, it is coming back,\" Pence said. \"But the choice is between a Trump recovery or a Biden depression,\" he added. Pence also invoked the courts and law and order. He said those like the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and now Justice Amy Coney Barrett are \"paving the way for opportunities for women in the law.\" He also called Barrett \"a brilliant jurist\" who is \"reflective of all the men and women that this president appointed.\" He also attacked Biden for not giving a clear answer on court packing. Pence said Biden needs to tell the American people if he respects the highest court in the land. He said Democrats will pack the court with activist judges if they win the election. Pence briefly talked about the coronavirus towards the end of his speech. He argued that despite the pandemic, the foundation President Trump poured in the first three years is leading to an economic comeback. Pence told supporters that the president \"led us with decisiveness through one of the most challenging years of my life time.\" He urged everyone to go vote and tell their friends and family the \"freedom is really on the line.\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden made his first trip to Georgia since becoming the Democratic nominee Tuesday, giving remarks in Warm Springs about hope and healing for the country that he said he will help usher in if elected. His message of unity and being the candidate to bring the country together is one that could resonate with his supporters in the Peach State.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that in a recent\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, 61% of Georgia voters said the candidates' personal character is a major factor in their vote for president. Later in the day, Biden spoke at a drive-in rally in the capital city of Atlanta, where running mate Kamala Harris visited last week. Recent visits by both campaigns to Atlanta indicate that the traditionally conservative state is more a toss-up than in recent years. The latest CBS News Battleground tracker poll shows the presidential contest is dead even in a state that also has competitive Senate races this year. Ahead of the former VP's appearance in Georgia, Stacey Abrams told\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0she feels \"bullish\" about his chances to flip the Peach State. She discussed her own historic candidacy for governor and pointed to increasing diversity in the state, noting Georgia has the single highest percentage of Black eligible voters (33%) out of any battleground state. \"My candidacy in 2018 was a watershed for us because we were able to pour $40 million into activating voters across the state, engaging communities that had long not been reached,\" Abrams explained. \"We were able to put together a playbook for what could happen and we have watched the Biden campaign, lift up that playbook and follow up. They have followed through not only by saying that they believe in Georgia, but by investing in Georgia.\" The Biden campaign also released a batch of new ads as part of its closing argument to voters. The series features several direct-to-camera appeals by Biden and Harris. The campaign says the robust messaging will continue nationally and in key battlegrounds through Election Day to mobilize Black voters. \"We saw what happened in 2016, so we're encouraging people to keep going, get out there and vote,\" said Kamau Marshall, the campaign's director of strategic communications. BARACK OBAMA Former President Barack Obama\u00a0returned to the campaign trail\u00a0to stump for Biden and criticize President Trump\u00a0at an event in Orlando, Florida, according to\u00a0CBSNews.com reporter Melissa Quinn. The current president, Mr. Obama said, \"hasn't shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show that can give him the attention that he craves.\" \"The presidency doesn't change who you are. It reveals who you are,\" Mr. Obama said. \"And Joe time and time again has shown himself to be a man of principle and character, and he's going to be a great president.\" In 2016, President Trump won Union County by more than 32,000 votes with 63% of the vote in the county. Union is one of a handful of counties surrounding Democratic-leaning Mecklenburg county (home to Charlotte) that supported the president in 2016. In Union, 71% of its 239,000 residents are White making it demographically quite different from its more racially-diverse and much larger neighbor Mecklenburg county. Still, one North Carolina-based political scientist told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that Union is one of four bellwether counties that could be an indicator of how the rest of the state will vote. In a state where Mr. Trump won 76 of its 100 counties in 2016, the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll shows the race is tight, with Biden leading by 4 points, which is within the poll's margin of error. Joe Biden is the biggest spender in the 2020 election across the board on advertising, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. With one week to go before Election Day, he's now spent more than $600 million on TV, radio and digital ads according to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group. That includes more than $450 on television, nearly $130 million on digital ads, and $23 million on radio. By comparison, President Trump has spent nearly $425 million including $174 million on digital ads. This week alone, Biden is slated to spend at least $35 million on TV and radio. He's been mostly focused on 16 battleground states. Meanwhile, the president is only spending about $8.5 million this week on TV according to Kantar/CMAG. The RNC is also teaming up with the campaign with another $15 million. Between the two entities, they're focused in 12 states as of Tuesday. Biden has focused much of his final TV pitch on unity. Two ads released Tuesday are direct-to-camera pitches from the former vice president and his wife Jill Biden. \"This is our opportunity to leave the dark, angry politics of the past four years behind us, to choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction,\" says Biden in the 60 second spot called\u00a0Rising. \"I believe it's time to unite the country.\" Jill Biden has a similar message. \"I know in my heart that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for these families what he did for ours. Bring us together, help us find light in the darkness, keep hope for the future alive in all of us,\" she says in an ad titled\u00a0In the Dark. In another spot aired this past week, a narrator says, \"America is a place for everyone, those who chose this country, those who fought for it, some Republicans, some Democrats and most just somewhere in between.\" It ends with the narrator saying America is looking for someone to \"work just as hard for the people who voted for him, as those who didn't. To be a president for all Americans.\" Other ads focus on voting, health care and combating the coronavirus. While the president has aired far fewer new ads in the past seven days, one of his latest ads titled\u00a0Uphold the Law\u00a0accuses Biden of refusing to strongly condemn violence amid protests this year, something he has publicly done. In it the narrator says, \"President Trump will keep America safe.\" Another ad from the Trump campaign first airing nationally this week features clips of Biden talking about banning new fracking and recent comments about transitioning from the oil industry. It features a woman who works in fracking and warned it would be the end of her livelihood. And just in time for Halloween, the Trump campaign aired a new ad nationally that begins with, \"Here's how you can spot a zombie,\" before showing a number of clips of Joe Biden, and ending \"with your help, we can prevent the zombie uprising.\" The president and RNC also continue targeting seniors with ads about protecting Medicare. Looking at Facebook spending, Biden is also outspending President Trump on ads here over the past week, with $8.4 million to $5.75 million from October 19 to 25. It's a trend that has continued since the summer. Both campaigns are using Facebook to encourage people to get the polls and vote this week. This comes as Facebook's new policy of not allowing any new political ads to be placed within a week of Election Day is about to take effect. Ads already running will continue, but there won't be new ones over the next week. Facebook also has a ban on all political ads after the election in an effort it claims will help combat abuse. America is voting. And it's doing it in record numbers. With a week to go before Election Day, early voting totals have eclipsed 2016 levels. Turn out in Texas is already 82% of overall participation four years ago. In Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, it's 66%. Experts predict turnout will only accelerate the closer we get to November 3. In the debut episode of \"The Debrief\" with\u00a0CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, the challenges of voting in a pandemic were examined. Would there be enough poll workers? How about enough funding? Could states adopt new laws to accommodate voting procedures with expanded absentee access? Would those changes lead to widespread fraud? In this episode, thirteen weeks later, we answer those questions with\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster,\u00a0Zak\u00a0Hudak,\u00a0Cara\u00a0Korte,\u00a0LaCrai\u00a0Mitchell,\u00a0Alex\u00a0Tin\u00a0and\u00a0Jack\u00a0Turman. We've come a long way since July, but have we come far enough? A Michigan Court of Claims judge on Tuesday struck down Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's order that banned openly carrying firearms within 100 feet of polling locations, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Benson's order was challenged by gun rights groups and open carry advocates, along with one serial litigant in Michigan. The Detroit News\u00a0reports\u00a0that the judge said the order \"smacks of an attempt at legislation\" during the hearing. \"The Legislature has said: Here are the places you cannot carry a weapon,\" Judge Christopher Murray said during the hearing, according to the Detroit News. \"The secretary has expanded that. And so how is that in accordance with state law?\" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel plans to appeal the decision. \"We intend to immediately appeal the judge's decision as this issue is of significant public interest and importance to our election process,\" press secretary Ryan Jarvi said in a statement. Some local law enforcement officials said they were not planning to enforce the order. Nessel and Benson said Michigan State Police would be stepping in to help with enforcement if needed. Following Ohio Senator Rob Portman's vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Ohio Democrats are launching a fundraising effort for his eventual Democratic challenger in 2022, when he's up for re-election. Organizers -- all young Democrats in the state -- include: Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, Hamilton County clerk of courts Aftab Pureval, Columbus city attorney Zach Klein, Franklin County recorder Danny O'Connor, Portage County commissioner Kathleen Clyde and Columbus city councilwoman Liz Brown. The fundraising effort is similar to Democratic efforts in 2018 to raise money for the Democrat in Maine challenging Senator Susan Collins, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Collins, who is up for re-election in 2020, is in a tough race against Democratic candidate Sara Gideon. In terms of voting, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that more than 2.2 million Ohioans have already cast their ballot. That number surpasses the 1.9 million Ohioans who voted early in person or by mail throughout the entire 2016 general election. The secretary's office also noted that more than 1.4 million absentee ballots have been returned and more than 743,000 Ohioans have already voted early in-person with a week until Election Day. In addition, Ohio's county boards of elections have received 3,173,586 absentee ballot requests. \"Each week it's a new record -- and that's because enthusiastic voters are taking advantage of Ohio's convenient voting opportunities which are some of the best in the nation,\" LaRose said in a statement. In Franklin County, Ohio, which includes Columbus, the county board of elections announced that more than 244,000 voters have returned their mail-in ballot or voted early in-person at the county board of elections. In addition, the board announced that more than 5,600 poll workers will work at the county's 324 voting locations on Election Day. Today was the last day you could apply for a general election mail-in ballot in Pennsylvania -- over 3 million have already done so, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. As a result, early voting as it exists in Pennsylvania stops today, too. While there's no official early in-person voting in the state, voters have been able to go to their county elections office, apply for a mail ballot, fill it out there and return it on the spot. That's the closest thing the state has to early, in-person voting. Some counties across the state, including massive Philadelphia and Allegheny, have opened multiple satellite elections offices to allow more of this kind of voting. And those who have received or will receive ballots in the mail but have not turned them in yet will still be able to submit them in person or mail them in. Assuming the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't rule differently, mail ballots received up to 3 days after the Election Day will be counted, so long as they are not clearly postmarked after Nov. 3. A local Pennsylvania board of elections today filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting that Judge Amy Coney Barrett recuse herself from consideration in a case over that 3-day mail ballot extension,\u00a0Hudak\u00a0also reports. The Board of Elections in Luzerne County, a key battleground within the battleground state, argued in a motion that President Trump's latest confirmed Supreme Court justice is required by the Judicial Code to recuse herself from the case because her, \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" They also argue that no one may choose their own judge. The Supreme Court last week\u00a0voted\u00a04-4 on a request from Pennsylvania Republicans for it to halt an order from the state's high court creating a 3-day mail ballot receipt extension. The split vote meant the lower court's decision stood. The Pennsylvania GOP responded later that week by going back to the U.S. Supreme Court, which they were able to do by asking for a hasty ruling on whether the state court's ruling was constitutional; previously they had asked only for it to be stopped until they ruled. Both parties care deeply about this issue because more than twice as many Democrats as Republicans have applied to vote by mail in the state. In the state's primary, over 100,000 mail ballots came in after Election Day, and that number is expected to be multiplied in the general election. In 2016, Donald Trump won the state by far less, about 44,000 votes.",

            "article_content": "The next round of presidential nominating contests, which are scheduled for April 4, will now all take place with mail ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Alaska Democrats on Monday canceled in-person voting for their primary in favor of voting by mail. On Saturday, Democrats in Hawaii scrapped their in-person primary voting and said they would offer another round of mail ballots to voters. And earlier this month, Wyoming Democrats canceled their in-person caucuses and told Democrats to submit their votes by mail or drop off ballots to local election officials.\u00a0 Seven states and Puerto Rico have postponed their in-person primaries due to coronavirus, but that may only be a temporary solution if the virus isn't under control by the time the new election days come up on the calendar. And with a presidential election looming in November, along with primaries for House and Senate seats, governors and other state and local races in the coming months, there have been growing calls to expand absentee and mail voting capabilities.\u00a0 \"America could be faced with a choice this fall of either Americans being able to vote - which means voting by mail - or not voting at all,\" said Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden on Monday. Wyden, along with Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, introduced a bill last week to expand voting access. It includes, among other measures, requiring states to have 20 days of early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee voting by mail. \"Americans are facing unprecedented disruptions to their daily lives and we don't want them to lose the ability to have a say over their own government,\" Klobuchar said on Monday. \"We've already seen some of the primary elections postponed and we won't want that to happen in November. And one of the things we can do to make it safer for everyone is to just get those ballots out there with postage.\" But expanding voting by mail wouldn't be cheap. An analysis from the\u00a0Brennan Center for Justice\u00a0estimated it could cost $982 million to $1.4 billion to ensure voting by mail is available to all voters. That includes costs for postage, ballot printing, securing drop boxes for ballots and improving absentee ballot processing. Those proposals are part of a\u00a0larger set of recommendations\u00a0to protect elections in the event the Coronavirus pandemic continues into November. The price tag on all of the Brennan Center's recommendations, including the vote by mail expansion, is up to $2 billion. Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who is a co-sponsor of the Wyden and Klobuchar bill, is pushing for $2 billion in the Phase 3 Coronavirus stimulus bill to expand voting by mail and early voting, his press secretary Madeline Broas told CBS News. The exact amount for elections is still being negotiated.\u00a0 CBS News Producer Rebecca Kaplan\u00a0reports that House Democrats are proposing a new national requirement that states offer 15 days early voting and no-excuse absentee voting by mail, including mandating that states mail a ballot to all registered voters in an emergency. The requirement, which is part of a competing stimulus bill being crafted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her members, would offer states $4 billion in grant funding through the Election Assistance Commission to carry out the new requirements.\u00a0 Michigan is one of the states that recently made it easier to vote by mail. In 2018, voters passed a ballot measure to allow for no-excuse absentee voting, which led to an explosion in absentee votes in the state's presidential primary earlier this month. Nearly 40% of the people, or 876,845, voted absentee in that election. That was almost double the number of absentee votes from the 2016 presidential primary in Michigan. Jocelyn Benson, Michigan's Secretary of State, told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0that the big challenges for expanding access to voting by mail are educating voters about the process and securing the infrastructure to tabulate votes securely and quickly. That includes providing postage on ballots, ballot tracking technology, more access to high-speed ballot processing and counting machines and, in some cases, hiring more workers to process the ballots. \"Those of us who have been doing this work for a long time know exactly what we need and the tools we need for the most part to administer elections by mail or where the majority of citizens are voting by mail in a crisis like this,\" Benson said. \"The gap in between what we know needs to happen and our ability to make it happen is all in funding.\" While it took longer for Michigan to report its full results due to the influx of ballots, Benson said communities that were staffed similar to general elections were typically better equipped to handle the increased number of absentee ballots. She and other secretaries of state have been talking about best practices to implement going forward, but said the federal government should set standards for access, security and voter education. Wisconsin, which is scheduled to hold its primary on April 7, is still planning to allow for in-person voting, but asked the state for help to supply sanitation equipment, recruit more poll workers and provide a public health expert. Wisconsin also has no-excuse absentee voting, but on Monday the state's election commission put out a letter asking for more poll workers to help staff the election \"to replace older poll workers who are unable to serve due to health concerns and the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.\" Meagan Wolfe, the Chief Election Official, wrote in a letter to Governor Tony Evers on Friday, \"As of today, local election officials do not have access to the people or supplies needed.\"\u00a0 Wolfe added that \"this leaves voters, clerks, and poll workers to make difficult choices. Voters should not have to choose between voting or staying healthy. Poll workers should not have to choose between serving their community or staying healthy. Our local election officials should not have to choose between facilitating democracy or staying healthy.\" JOE BIDEN In 15 minutes of remarks from his new in-home studio in Wilmington, Joe Biden offered a pre-rebuttal of sorts to the president's daily press briefings, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. \"These briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the American public they are not a place for political attacks or to lash out at the press,\" Biden said appearing to read from a teleprompter, \"They're about the American people.\" The former vice president asked for the \"unvarnished truth\" from the president about the current response and chided the president's self-congratulation. \"Trump keeps saying he's a wartime president. Well, start to act like one,\" Biden said. While a few kinks are still sorting out, the Biden campaign is forced to\u00a0retool\u00a0their almost entire approach without public events. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY Monday marks 10 years since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare, into law. The anniversary comes at a time of national emergency amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, notes\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The ten-year mark also hits just weeks after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case brought forward by Republican state officials against the law. Justices are set to review a federal appeals court decision that found part of the law \u2014  Congress' 2017 removal of the individual mandate clause, requiring citizens to possess health insurance \u2014  unconstitutional. Though timing is up to the Supreme Court Justices, oral arguments are likely to fall around the time of the 2020 presidential general election in November, with a decision due in spring or summer 2021. The litigation aimed at eliminating the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's legacy is backed by the Trump administration. In a digital livestream on Monday, Biden touted his role in passing the Affordable Care Act. \"In the middle of one of the largest public health emergencies in generations, the White House and Republican Attorney Generals are actively pursuing a lawsuit to invalidate the ACA in court. They're working to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare, and tens of millions of their protections for pre-existing conditions,\" he said. The Democratic presidential frontrunner sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Monday, requesting the Trump administration withdraw the lawsuit, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. \"The litigation you are supporting \u2014  Texas\u00a0 v. U.S. \u2014  jeopardizes every single one of those protections and threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of Americans,\" reads the letter reads. \"There is no underlying constitutional flaw with the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the Supreme Court twice upheld the constitutionality of the law.\"\u00a0 At a press briefing from the Coronavirus Task Force on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump expressed his support for guaranteed healthcare coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. \"Well, that's a lawsuit coming out of Texas. Again, that was headed up by Texas,\" Mr. Trump said, probed about the pending case. \"And what we want to do is get rid of the bad healthcare and put in a great healthcare.\u00a0 And I will say this, I can make this commitment to you: The Republican Party is fully backing preexisting conditions.\" According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Trump administration is actively considering launching a special enrollment period for Americans facing the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The special approval would allow 32 states reliant on federal healthcare exchange to re-open enrollment, permitting Americans to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act although open enrollment ended on December 15th for these states. \u00a0The Kaiser Family Foundation says\u00a0nearly 28 million people\u00a0in the United States lack health insurance. According to a\u00a0Gallup poll\u00a0released earlier this month, 52% of Americans surveyed approve of the Affordable Care Act and 48% of the population disapprove. Democratic Party chair Tom Perez told reporters on Wednesday that he expects health care to be \"a defining issue of this election.\" Perez continued that \"the chronic incompetence of this president on health care and so many issues runs far and deep. And the American people will remember. They remembered it in 2017, 2018 and 2019. When health care was on the ballot, Democrats won in scale.\" According to CBS News Battleground Tracker polls, health care has been the top issue of importance to likely Democratic voters in early contest states since the launch of the CBS News survey in June 2019. BEING SELECTIVE The Democratic National Committee has received requests from 19 states and territories to amend delegate selection plans, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. In a memo obtained by CBS News, the chairs of the committee in charge of approving the delegate selection plans told its members they are in close contact with the state parties about modifying delegate selection plans. These plans outline how states elect the actual people to fill the delegate slots awarded to each candidate based on the results of the primary or caucus. In many states, these delegate elections were scheduled to take place after the primary or caucus and have been impacted by coronavirus. The 19 states and territories who have proposed amendments to their plans are: Alaska, California, Colorado, Democrats Abroad, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming. \u00a0 HIGH MARKS A\u00a0new poll from Monmouth University\u00a0on Monday shows governors are exceeding Mr. Trump in handling the coronavirus outbreak, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 According to the poll, 72% of those surveyed said their state's governor has done a good job and 18% said their governor has done a bad job in handling the pandemic. The reviews are bipartisan, with 76% of Democrats, 73% of Republicans and 67% of independents saying their governor has done a good job in dealing with the outbreak. The positive reviews even come from residents of the four states with the highest number of coronavirus cases: California, New Jersey, New York, and Washington. In these four states, 74% say their governor has done a good job. More Americans said Mr. Trump has done a good job (50%) than a bad job (45%), but the reviews of how Mr. Trump has dealt with the crisis are more partisan. About 89% of Republicans say he is handling it well while only 48% of independents and 19% of Democrats approve of his administration's handling of the situation. The poll shows how governors across the country have taken charge during the outbreak. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has received praise across the country for his daily briefings that include Powerpoint presentations about the outbreak in the state. During the Sunday White House COVID Task Force briefing, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Cuomo. \"He's working hard,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're all working hard together.\u00a0 The relationship has really been amazing.\" And Biden, during his virtual event on Monday, praised the governors. He singled out Republican Governors Mike DeWine of Ohio, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts as well as Democratic governors Gavin Newsom of California, Jay Inslee of Washington, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Cuomo. \u00a0\u00a0 MOVING FORWARD Perez told reporters on Monday that no official decision has been made regarding the upcoming Democratic Party Convention in Milwaukee amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"We are planning and hoping for the best, but planning for every eventuality. And safety will always be paramount in planning the convention,\" Perez said on the call commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. \"We still have roughly 4 months until the convention,\" he noted. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Perez also touted the party's digital operations, adding that the DNC is in the process of hiring more personnel. \"And needless to say, the lion's share of the people that we're hiring, in our battleground build up, are going to be people who are very fluent in digital organizing,\" he told reporters. Perez added that the party has trained over 900 \"digital organizers\" in remote sessions last week, and plans to conduct more trainings in the days to come. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG A former field organizer for Mike Bloomberg's campaign\u00a0filed a lawsuit in federal court\u00a0on Monday against the former presidential candidate. The lawsuit alleges the White House hopeful reneged on promises that staff would be guaranteed employment through November 2020. The billionaire\u00a0had earned plaudits\u00a0over the weekend for donating millions to the Democratic party from his now-shuttered campaign, after spending\u00a0nearly one billion dollars\u00a0on the bid. But Bloomberg's transfer also\u00a0triggered outrage\u00a0among some former staffers, many who claim they were promised jobs on a super PAC he has now abandoned plans to fund. \"Given the current crisis, a fund is being created to ensure that all staff receive healthcare through April, which no other campaign has done,\" a spokesperson for Bloomberg's campaign told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0in a statement. \"And many field staff will go on to work for the DNC in battleground states, in part because the campaign made the largest monetary transfer to the DNC from a Presidential campaign in history to support the DNC's organizing efforts.\" AMY KLOBUCHAR As the Senate goes back and forth ahead of a vote on whether to move forward with a\u00a0coronavirus stimulus package,\u00a0 Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced Monday that her husband has coronavirus. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted on Medium, the former 2020 contender briefly described how her husband's health has deteriorated\u2014citing that a persistent fever and coughing up blood led to him being tested and later admitted into a Virginia hospital for several reasons, including very low oxygen levels.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that\u00a0Virginia's governor\u00a0declared\u00a0a state of emergency earlier this month and announced Monday that public schools in the state will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. This comes as the Virginia Department of Health has reported 254 cases, 38 hospitalizations and 6 deaths related to COVID-19 in the state. Klobuchar said her husband remains in the hospital and has pneumonia but said she hasn't been in the same place as her husband for two weeks so she won't be getting tested. \"\u2026since John and I have been in different places for the last two weeks and I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me to not get a test,\" said Klobuchar in the statement. \"\u2026there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don't qualify to get one under any standard.\"",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden is inheriting an economy that remains badly scarred by the coronavirus, including high unemployment and financial hardship for millions of Americans. The upshot: He has a mountain to climb, especially as COVID-19 cases soar to alarming new heights and with control of the Senate still up in the air. Here are the major economic challenges facing the Biden administration, along with how the change in the White House might impact everything from jobs and your taxes to health care and climate policy.\u00a0 As of October, nearly 26 million Americans were either out of the workforce or not working as many hours as they would like, according to Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute and formerly the chief economist at the Department of Labor in the Obama administration. Although unemployment has fallen from 14.7% in April to 6.9%, roughly 15% of the country's workforce remains either jobless or underemployed. The rebound in jobs is also expected to slow in the months ahead as another coronavirus wave sweeps across the U.S. \"The pace of job growth is slowing and we still have this massive hole in the labor market,\" Shierholz told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 No surprise, then, that Mr. Biden's top economic priority is curb COVID-19. \"We cannot repair the economy ... until we get this virus under control,\" he noted in his acceptance speech on Saturday. Mr. Biden also wants to provide more financial relief for jobless workers and businesses hurt during the pandemic as well as shore up federal funding for cash-strapped state and local governments. That won't be an easy lift \u2014 Senate Republicans have pushed to limit the scale of another stimulus package, while President Donald Trump's defeat at the polls could dissuade him from signing off on another bill.\u00a0 Still, Mr. Biden could still accomplish a lot on the economic front through executive orders and federal rule changes, Shierholz said. For instance, he could boost the federal minimum wage for people working on government contracts, which amount to 4 million workers, according to the Brookings Institution. Mr. Biden is also expected to reverse some Trump-era rules, such as one that made it more difficult for many workers to qualify for overtime pay. Ensuring continued job growth could hinge on the government offering another substantial round of relief, with economists crediting the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (or CARES) Act passed in March with helping businesses and unemployed workers stay afloat financially. With many of those CARES Act programs now expired, Mr. Biden is expected to push for a generous stimulus package that could both boost the economy by driving spending and get unemployed workers through what might a tough winter, given rising coronavirus rates.\u00a0 \"Stimulus is absolutely crucial and totally tied to how well the labor market does,\" Shierholz said. David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, thinks the Senate may opt to pass a smaller aid package before Mr. Biden's inauguration in January. That would likely provide more money for the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers loans to small businesses, as well as fund supplemental unemployment benefits. And another package could be forthcoming in early next year, according to Kelly. One effort likely to be renewed is the $1,200 stimulus payment for single adults and $2,400 for married couples,\u00a0 Mr. Biden has proposed raising taxes on high-income Americans and corporations by as much as $4 trillion over the next decade.\u00a0 But the president-elect would need Congress to sign on as well \u2014 that won't be easy if Republicans retain their majority in the Senate after two special run-off elections\u00a0in Georgia in January.\u00a0 \"Obama had a hard time negotiating with the Republicans to raise taxes, so I suspect it will be the same for Biden,\" said economist Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal-leaning think tank.\u00a0 That means the income tax or estate tax increase for individuals, including higher-income people, are unlikely to happen. But Mr. Biden has pushed for some tax credits. He's likely to get support from both sides of the political aisle for those given the state of the economy.\u00a0 The most likely tax break is a $15,000 credit for first-time home buyers to offset the cost of a downpayment. Republicans might also side with Mr. Biden and Democrats who would like to expand the the child tax credit to as much as $3,600 per child, from the current $2,000 (Mr. Biden would like to award those tax credits in monthly installments, rather than a one-time lump sum at tax time.) As for corporate taxes, the president-elect could effectively get a large portion of his proposed increase even without swaying Congress. That's because the corporate income rate cuts passed under Mr. Trump in late-2017, unlike the individual ones, will start to expire during Mr. Biden's first term. In 2022, companies will start phasing out a tax cut that allowed them to temporarily expense a large portion of their research and development and capital expenditure costs upfront. Recognizing those expenses immediately, rather than spreading them over a number of years, reduces near-term profits and corporate tax bills.\u00a0 Morgan Stanley has previously estimated the change will boost corporate taxes by $800 billion over a decade. And Mr. Biden might be able to negotiate an overall tax deal sooner given that an increase would happen anyway.\u00a0 \"Extreme policy changes are likely off the table,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"But I think there is bipartisan support for establishing a minimum corporate tax rate so that no company can avoid paying taxes altogether.\" Some of any corporate tax increase could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices or lower wages. Earlier this year, an analysis from Wharton's business school estimated that the average workers's take-home pay could drop by $216, if all of Biden's tax plans were implemented. Top 1% wage earners, though, would pay nearly $50,000 more. Mr. Trump claimed before the election that the stock market would crash if Mr. Biden won. So far, however, stocks have surged. The Dow is up nearly 1,000 points since Mr Biden was anointed as president-elect. Even before the election, many stock market strategists predicted that Mr. Biden's policies would lift both the economy and the market. \"Looks like Biden won and the market didn't crash,\" Sonders said. \"That was rhetoric, but there was no reason to believe that would happen.\"\u00a0 In the aftermath of the election, investors appear to be cheering that Republican wins in the Senate means Mr. Biden won't be able to pass his most aggressive corporate tax increases. Either way, corporate profits are likely to soar next year if, as many experts think, a vaccine becomes available next year. That doesn't mean investors are in the clear. The coronavirus will still almost certainly weigh on the economy for months to come, while a markets-boosting stimulus package may have to wait until 2021. Sonders points out Wall Street doesn't have a great record of predicting what will happen in the stock market based on who the president is. Financial stocks and oil producers were expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of Mr. Trump's deregulation, but stocks in those two sectors have lagged the rest of the market over the past four years. \"There are so many forces that drive the market, and whether the White House is blue or red is not a big one,\" she said. Mr. Biden campaigned on dramatically expanding the Affordable Care Act, but consumers shouldn't hold their breath. Nearly every major proposal from the campaign \u2014 including increased subsidies for individual health insurance plans, incentives for states to expand Medicaid and a federal \"public option\" for health insurance \u2014 relies on Congress passing legislation. So that would be a tall task in normal times, and an even harder one if Republicans maintain control of the Senate.\u00a0  \"[T]he probability of a bipartisan compromise on any health policy legislation is below 50%,\" analysts at the investment bank UBS said in a note. There are some changes Mr. Biden could take unilaterally to expand insurance coverage or reverse Trump administration changes. The new administration could extend the open enrollment period for ACA plans, allowing more time for consumers to sign up for health insurance. Mr. Biden could also require that health plans offer equal coverage for mental health care\u00a0 and cover contraception, reversing a Trump administration move. The administration could also lower the costs of certain prescription drugs, such as insulin and epinephrine (a key ingredient in EpiPens) by using something called \"compulsory licensing authority.\" This allows the government to bypass patents for certain \"essential\" medications and manufacture cheap alternatives. And Senate Democrats and Republicans could conceivably \u00a0pass a modest bill reducing prescription-drug prices, said Tricia Neuman, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mr. Biden's prescription cost proposal shares many elements with a bipartisan bill introduced last session by senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Wyden of Oregon. The bill would set limits on how much drug prices could rise annually and limit out-of-pocket drug spending for some Medicare recipients, Neuman noted. \"It wouldn't be everything that was in the Biden proposal,\" she said, \"but it's a start.\" ",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Biden campaign co-chair and Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond that aired Sunday, November 8, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Paula, thanks. We go to Biden campaign co-chair and Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond. He's in Philadelphia. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE CEDRIC RICHMOND: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 73 days until Inauguration Day. I know you're fresh off a win, but that clock has already started. The president elect announced last night he plans to form a COVID task force. What can you tell us about what they will do and what his first priorities are? REP. RICHMOND: Well, I can tell you they're going to take the- the Biden COVID plan, and they're going to turn it into policy and action items so that on day one we are ready to start to implement our plan and our vision for how we deal with COVID. And, of course, that involves robust testing of tracing and dealing with the economic fallout of COVID. MARGARET BRENNAN: Biden received nearly- the president elect, I should say, received nearly 74.5 million votes. But President Trump got a pretty impressive turnout of 70 million voters. Isn't that a strong sign that Trumpism is not dead? This is a force that you will have to reckon with. REP. RICHMOND: No, look, I think Vice President Biden will be a different kind of president. I think he's going to be able to bring House members from the Republican side, House members, Senate Republicans together on legislation. He served with many of them. But then again, you have to look at his numbers. He won Arizona. He will win Georgia. And that will give him some coattails and some leverage when dealing with the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Perhaps some, but the president elect just narrowly held together that so-called blue wall of Midwestern states. I mean, if you look at the breakdown in Wisconsin, for example, much of his victory was delivered by large margins in- in cities, areas like Milwaukee. If you look at it- the more rural areas, only two of the 23 counties that voted for President Trump in 2016 and, before that, President Obama actually flipped. So that divide still exists. Why do you think it seems to be deepening that divide between rural and urban America? REP. RICHMOND: Well, we control the House. Democrats control the House. The question is about the Senate and senators are elected statewide. And so when you look at us winning statewide in places like Georgia, I think that that is a wake up call to many senators that it's a different day. And, you know, statesmen, they look at the next generation. Politicians, they look at the next election. And so the fact that the battlefield will be a lot different for the Senate in two years, I think that all of that is leverage for us to achieve our agenda. But again, we want to work with both sides because at the end of the day, it's the American people we're trying to help. The old saying is that when two elephants fight, only the grass suffers. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, a lot of CBS polling has consistently shown that the American people blame both parties, particularly when it comes to this failure to deliver immediate financial relief for COVID-19. Do you think it was a miscalculation for Democrats not to compromise on that before the election? REP. RICHMOND: Well, no, look, if we separate our COVID relief, then people will get left behind and corporations will get taken care of. What the real failure was that we have a president of the United States that will not pick up the phone and call the speaker of the House. REP. RICHMOND: Speaker Pelosi has been very clear that she's willing to move, she's willing to meet halfway. But at the end of the day, we have to take care of front line workers. We have to provide state and local governments money for policemen and firemen and front line workers. If we do a COVID relief package without that, without taking care of the American people and state and local governments, it's a hollow package that will still hurt our inner cities and our states. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect that to pass before January? REP. RICHMOND: I would hope so, and we're coming back into session in the next week or so, and that will be one of our priorities. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand Democrats remain in the majority, but you did lose seats as a party in the House. Do you think there needs to be a change in leadership? REP. RICHMOND: No, I don't. MARGARET BRENNAN: You continue to support Speaker Pelosi then? REP. RICHMOND: I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague Whip Clyburn on Fox said recently, \"defund the police and Medicare for all and socialism were albatrosses around our necks.\" He was talking about this last election. Do you agree that these messages that may actually have energized some progressive voters, some young voters, have ultimately hurt your party? Is there a reckoning that needs to happen among Democrats? REP. RICHMOND: Well, I certainly think there should be a conversation. Now look, our progressive wing of the party is very important to our party, but I think that what Whip Clyburn was trying to say, that no matter how progressive your ideals and values are, and what you want to do and how bold your plans are, if we don't win, if we don't keep the majority of the House, you cannot implement any of those plans. So you can't govern if you can't win. And so I think our party has to make sure that we have a solid playbook of what we want to do, how we want to help the American people. But, when we lose and if we lose the House of Representatives, then we will be in the minority and we won't pass a bill for at least two years. And I think that- that his point is we have to make sure we win first and govern second. And so when we govern, we will govern with our values. But when we can't pass legislation, we shouldn't be out there talking about it. And some titles hurt. Defunding the police is a title that hurts Democrats, and especially when the fact of the matter is nobody's calling for defunding the police. We're calling for reinventing how we police communities in this country, how we do criminal justice. So, I think that basically what the Whip is saying, and I agree with, is that words have consequences. And in this election, those words cost us some Democratic members. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much Congressman for your time this morning. Congratulations. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Convention kicks off on Monday night with an event that will look almost nothing like national political conventions from years past, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The event, which was supposed to bring upwards of 50,000 people to Milwaukee, will now largely happen in cyberspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the speeches will be much shorter than usual and there will be no thunderous cheers for politicians delivering their remarks. About 400 people are working in operation centers in Milwaukee, New York, Los Angeles and Wilmington, Delaware to pull off the virtual event, which will feature a mix of live and pretaped content. Arguably the most anticipated speaker of the night is former first lady Michelle Obama, who will give the night's keynote remarks. \"I know Joe. He is a profoundly decent man guided by faith. He was a terrific Vice President. He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country,\" Obama said in a\u00a0clip\u00a0of her speech released by the Democratic National Convention Committee. Senator Bernie Sanders, who finished second among delegates in the Democratic primaries, is also speaking on Monday night. A senior Sanders aide tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0that Sanders' speech will focus on beating President Trump and why Sanders supports Joe Biden. In his speech, Sanders will make a direct appeal to people who supported other candidates in the primary and those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. \"The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together, defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president. My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine,\" Sanders says, according to prepared remarks released by the DNCC. Other speakers include Representative Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who was one of the women Biden considered to be his running mate. The theme for the night is \"We the People\" and there will be sections dedicated to racial justice and the COVID-19 pandemic. But one part of the night that has drawn a lot of attention is dedicated to putting \"country over party.\" That section features speakers who don't normally grace the stage at Democratic conventions: Republicans. Democratic officials had previously announced that former Ohio Governor John Kasich would speak, but the convention planners announced on Monday that a trio of Republican women would speak before him: former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, former Representative Susan Molinari of New YOrk and former California Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman. \"We can all see what's going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or party has all the answers,\" Kasich will say, according to prepared remarks. \"But what we do know is that we can do better than what we've been seeing today, for sure. And I know that Joe Biden, with his experience and his wisdom and his decency, can bring us together to help us find that better way.\"\u00a0 While Democrats are not traveling to Milwaukee this week to speak, Republicans are seizing on the opportunity to send their biggest names to the Badger State, including Mr. Trump who made a trip to Oshkosh on Monday. \"The voters of Wisconsin are very, very spectacular people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We are going to fight for every single aspect that you have going. We are never going to forget you. You didn't forget me in the last election.\" The president's son, Eric Trump, will be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Vice President Mike Pence visits southeast Wisconsin on Wednesday. Before the festivities began on Monday, Wisconsin Democrats had a virtual breakfast to kick off the convention week, where they expressed disappointment that the event couldn't be held in Milwaukee, but agreed it was the correct decision for health and safety. \"I do want to note a contrast,\" said Senator Tammy Baldwin, referring to the Mr. Trump campaign's visits. \"They're unsafe because they are holding in-person events. I don't know if they will be wearing masks, I hope they follow the mask guidelines that we have in our state.\" After almost 48 years of continuous convention attendance, Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver an in-person and live speech on Thursday night to accept his party's nomination for president. But viewers should expect to see Biden earlier than Thursday night,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports, as his deputy campaign manager promised on Monday the former Vice President will make \"surprise\" appearances throughout the week. And with the sustained media coverage expected on Biden throughout the week, questions have been raised about his recent press accessibility. His campaign only scheduled two events in the past 48 days that featured several questions from campaign reporters. In the interim, Biden has sat for local and national interviews, but those watching his campaign the closest rarely get to ask him questions. Biden's most recent and wide-ranging interview was on August 5 when he sat for a panel interview with journalists from the national associations of Black and Hispanic journalists. However, he has not shied away from friendly media appearances. On Monday,\u00a0Biden received the Cardi B interview treatment\u00a0as they sat down for an on-camera Zoom interview to essentially promote voting. Biden jokingly noted when his daughter was growing up she called him \"Joey B.\" The interview started with Biden asking questions to Cardi who repeatedly spoke about the importance of Medicare for All and assisting young Americans to pay for college. Biden sidestepped most of those mentions but promised to pass his already-announced plan for free college for families making less than $125,000. A former senior official under Mr. Trump's Department of Homeland Security\u00a0endorsed Biden\u00a0in a scathing video created by \"Republicans Voters Against Trump.\" \"What we saw week in and week out and for me after two and a half years in that administration was terrifying,\" former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor said. \"We would go in to try to talk to them about a pressing national security, cyber-attack, terrorism threat. He wasn't interested in those things to him. They weren't priorities. The president wanted to exploit the Department of Homeland Security for his own political purposes and to fuel his own agenda.\" In response to the video, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere called Taylor \"another creature of the D.C. Swamp who never understood the importance of the President's agenda or why the American people elected him.\" CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports Mr. Trump made stops in political battlegrounds Minnesota and Wisconsin, Monday. While speaking in Oshkosh, Wisconsin -- just 90 miles north of the former site of the Democratic National Convention -- Mr. Trump asserted without evidence, \"the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.\" A CBS News Battleground tracker poll released Sunday shows the president 10 points behind Biden among likely voters nationwide. Mr. Trump continued to sow doubts about the integrity of November's presidential election as concerns mount over how the U.S. Postal Service will deliver a crush of mail-in ballots. Meanwhile, new postmaster general and major Republican fundraiser Louis DeJoy agreed to testify before the Democratic-led House Oversight and Reform Committee next week amid growing pressure from lawmakers to reverse a series of changes that have led to mail delivery delays. Louis DeJoy, who took the helm of the U.S. Postal Service as postmaster general in June, and Robert Duncan, the chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, will voluntarily appear before the Oversight panel on Monday, August 24.\u00a0In a tweet, Mr. Trump criticized the timing of the hearing, which lands on the first day of the Republican National Convention. The RNC is planning a fireworks display at the Washington Monument at 11:30 p.m. ET on August 27, according to a National Parks permit application obtained first by\u00a0CBS News White House producer Sara Cook. If approved,\u00a0Sganga\u00a0says the planned festivities would follow Mr. Trump's convention acceptance speech from White House grounds. The application accounts for 50 personnel and warns the event \"may attract First Amendment demonstrators.\" The permit application is still being processed. Amid the coronavirus and protests against racial injustice,\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns\u00a0launched a new series called \"America's Right to Vote,\" focused on voting rights, safety and access. The\u00a0first episode\u00a0looks at regulations in place that make it more difficult for some people. \"Barriers are put in the way and they're often subtle,\" says Michael Waldman, president of the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. \"They can look kind of bureaucratic and complex, but in fact they have the same kind of impact, unfair impact, on Black voters and Latino voters of some of the laws from the past. Voter suppression is not just something from long ago newsreels. It happens today. It happens now.\" Many key restrictions have been implemented over the past decade, and involve voter ID laws, cutting back on early voting, eliminating same-day registration and redistricting. Many states have expanded the option of mail-in voting during the pandemic. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia do not require an excuse to vote absentee. Last week, Kentucky announced a bipartisan deal to allow voters concerned about the pandemic to vote absentee. But additional barriers exist. Nine states require voters to produce witness signatures or have their ballot signed by a public notary. Most states require absentee ballots to be returned by Election Day, so threats to Postal Service funding could end up suppressing votes. Photos of U.S. Postal Service flatbed trucks hauling away those iconic blue collection boxes went viral over the weekend. In places like Morristown, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon and Billings, Montana, residents were alarmed by their removal, and Democrats subsequently sounded alarms, warning of a larger Trump-led effort to reduce the number of collection boxes in the country and therefore reducing the number of safe sites for mailed ballots. The USPS, in response, placed a 90-day moratorium on collection box removal. The Postal Service also attempted to cool heads in a statement claiming that box removal is standard operating procedure and done when boxes are not receiving high volumes of mail and their removal would not hurt a community.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0spoke to a USPS spokesperson from the Pacific Northwest who reiterated that box removals were \"completely routine\" and \"happen all year.\" In Morristown, New Jersey this weekend, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill\u00a0saw\u00a0reports of boxes being carted away and in response said her office would be investigating the matter. A spokesperson from Representative Sherrill's office told\u00a0Korte\u00a0they had received more than 2,000 emails over the weekend from constituents worried about the USPS making it harder for them to vote. Senate candidate Mark Kelly denounced \"delays and political attacks on the Postal Service\" in a statement\u00a0on Monday, joining a chorus of Arizona Democrats decrying controversial USPS changes ahead of the November election. Even before the coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says nearly 8 in 10 Arizonans cast their ballots by mail in the 2018 election. Now Arizona's Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is calling on the state attorney general's Election Integrity Unit\u00a0to investigate the USPS moves, fearing \"a larger, coordinated scheme to interfere\" with mail voting by President Trump and his allies. \"We review every complaint, regardless of merit. Confidence in elections is the cornerstone of our democracy. I will continue to protect the integrity of our elections, even when other state officials won't,\" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, said in a statement. Hobbs' letter comes ahead of a key bench trial tomorrow with attorneys from both officials, as well as national Democrats and Republicans, over the upcoming election. Democrats\u00a0have asked a federal court\u00a0to grant mail voters in the state an opportunity after the election to \"cure\" ballots that are missing signatures, arguing current rules violate Arizonans' rights. A day ahead of the Florida state primary election,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Division of Elections shows that the number of ballots received via mail has nearly doubled the number of mail-in votes that were counted in the 2016 state primary contest.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that in some of the state's larger Central and Southern counties, hundreds of thousands of voters have already voted by mail. Half a million Florida voters have voted early, comparable to the number of early votes received in 2016. As more voters cast early ballots and vote by mail, volunteers and supporters for Joe Biden and President Trump held events throughout the state. In Sarasota, the Trump Victory Florida team hosted Vice President Mike Pence's nephew, John Pence, for an in-person MAGA meet-up. An hour north, thousands of pro-Trump boaters\u00a0reportedly\u00a0gathered in Clearwater, Florida, for one of the largest boat parades on record. And in the Naples area, Biden volunteers and supporters also assembled \"Ridin' for Biden\" caravans to support the former vice president and discuss the importance of voting, according to\u00a0CBS Fort Myers affiliate WINK. In an interview with Fox News on Monday,\u00a0Mr. Trump again warned\u00a0of \"disaster\" in Nevada citing recent changes to the state's election laws over the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the president also repeated a false claim that the state would not verify signatures on mail ballots. While a bill passed by the state's Democratic-led legislature revised procedures around signature matching on mail ballots, election officials in the state will indeed continue to match signatures on mail ballots come November. In fact, attorneys for President Trump's campaign acknowledged the requirement in their own lawsuit against Nevada's Republican secretary of state, only going so far as to claim the law opened\u00a0a potential \"loophole\"\u00a0over unsigned ballots that are delivered folded together. Matthew Morgan, general counsel to the president's campaign, told CBS News in a statement that the signature verification provision in Nevada Democrats' AB4 is an absolute joke. Actual verification will never happen\u2014not surprising given the Democrats' lead lawyer calls this key election integrity practice 'junk science.\" Ohio Congressional Democrats sent a letter to the state's Secretary of State Frank LaRose urging him to walk back his position of limiting county board of elections to one ballot drop box. In the letter, Democrats cited the state's mail-in primary in April and wrote that the state should build off the lessons learned before it is too late. The lawmakers argued that limiting county boards of elections to one ballot drop box is suppressing the vote. \"If you proceed to restrict the availability of secure drop boxes, this policy will undermine the ability of many Ohioans to vote,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"We urge you to reconsider your decision, and use your authority to permit local boards of elections to locate additional secure boxes in their communities.\" Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost\u00a0called on the president\u00a0to postpone his reforms to the postal service until after the November election, according to a letter obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In the letter, dated August 16, Yost urged the president to delay the operational changes to the institution. \"Making the radical changes only weeks before early voting begins - however fiscally well founded - would place the solvency of the Post Office above the legitimacy of the Government itself,\" Yost wrote. Yost expressed confidence in Ohio's election officials to safely and securely administer an election. He wrote that whatever reforms the president is looking to implement \"cannot come at the expense of our faith in the 2020 election.\" In a virtual press conference Monday morning ahead of the Democratic National Convention this week, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio blasted the president's attack on the U.S. Postal Service, adding that people rely on the Postal Service to receive medications and to pay bills, in addition to casting their ballot. Brown also said that U.S. postmaster general Louis DeJoy is a \"political hack\" who \"knows nothing about the Postal Service.\" Brown said, \"It's amazing the president of the United States thinks it's okay to scare people, thinks it's okay to begin the dismantling of this great institution that has a very productive workforce.\" Brown also recalled an anecdote about Senator Kamala Harris of California handing him \"All Labor Has Dignity,\" a collection of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s speeches on economic justice. Brown said that book provides insight into the \"dignity of work,\" a common phrase used by Brown, and into Harris' values. \"She understands that to bring this country back, it's the workers,\" Brown said. \"It's through essential workers who know they're essential but feel they're expendable. It's about the dignity of work. It's about all labor has dignity.\" Ohio GOP chairwoman Jane Timken and Congressmen Bob Gibbs held a press call Monday afternoon criticizing Biden and Harris on their economic policies. In her opening remarks, Timken said Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican who is speaking at the Democratic National Convention, \"has jumped onto the bandwagon.\" Massachusetts Congressman Richard Neal and Mayor Alex Morse are set to have their first Democratic primary debate in Massachusetts' 1st district Monday night, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The hour-long debate is a checkpoint in what has been a roller coaster primary for Morse in recent weeks. On August 7, the College Democrats of Massachusetts\u00a0sent a letter to Morse,\u00a0rejecting his campaign and alleging Morse, a part-time lecturer, had inappropriate relationships with students. The\u00a0Massachusetts Daily Collegian\u00a0reported that the group found issue with Morse using college Democrat events to meet and add students on social media, as well as with matching with several of them on dating apps. Morse has admitted to the relationships, telling the Daily Collegian that they were all consensual. But an August 12 story by\u00a0The Intercept\u00a0alleged the letter was politically motivated and planned. The story details how one college strategist was a \"Neal stan\" and discussed Morse's use of dating apps to hurt his campaign. The Neal campaign has denied any\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with the college Democrats group. The state Democratic party said they would be independently reviewing the situation, but a\u00a0story alleged coordination\u00a0between the college and state Democratic party. In a Friday email, Morse's campaign characterized the narrative as a \"coordinated political smear.\" On\u00a0Twitter, Morse said he was confident his name would be cleared through an investigation but also apologized for having made some students \"uncomfortable.\" Morse was promptly backed up by progressives like Jamaal Bowman of New York, the Sunrise Movement and the Justice Democrats group, which began a\u00a0$150,000\u00a0ad buy hitting Neal on his ties to special interests. Justice Democrats see Morse as another formidable progressive candidate, hoping to continue the streak of successful incumbent upsets set by Bowman, Cori Bush of Missouri and Marie Newman of Illinois. Neal, who has been in Congress since 1989, drastically leads the money race with about\u00a0$4.2 million on hand.\u00a0An internal Morse poll showed him down to Neal by 5 points. Mail Following the DNC, Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to the caucus that they will be coming back Saturday for a vote related to the USPS. The House was originally slated to be on summer recess until mid-September. House Republicans immediately criticized Pelosi for ending the recess short over the USPS, but not ending it to work on another coronavirus relief package. Their most recent package, the HEROES Act, was passed overwhelmingly by House Democrats in May. When asked on\u00a0Fox News\u00a0if the return from recess was a \"clear political stunt,\" Republican House campaign arm Chair Tom Emmer said \"clearly so.\" He said Pelosi has \"refused to negotiate in good faith\" regarding coronavirus legislation, and that the return to Congress was Pelosi \"putting their partisan politics ahead of the American people.\" The House will be voting around 11 a.m. Saturday on Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney's \"Delivering for America Act,\" which would prevent any changes to USPS operations that were already in place on January 1, 2020. Suraj Patel, Maloney's former primary opponent, criticized Maloney, claiming post office errors were a reason 13,000 votes were thrown out. \"The Rep. KNEW there would be USPS problems two months ago - we lived them! Why has it taken her so long to act? What good will this do now?\" he\u00a0tweeted. Numbers Like many groups during the pandemic, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has prioritized digital outreach and other socially distant forms of campaigning. In numbers first shared with\u00a0Navarro, the committee says House Democrats have doubled their number of virtual events since June, adding 2,000 volunteers and reaching out to over 840,000 voters. Thirty-two House Democrat campaigns, either incumbents or challengers, have released television ads or other paid media.",

            "article_content": "America's favorite sports are on hiatus, and swaths of the nation are under stay-home orders but at least voters will be able to tune in for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions this year, which are still scheduled to take place in August in Milwaukee and Charlotte, respectively.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0report\u00a0that while local and state leaders usually look forward to the spotlight afforded by political conventions, this year is different given the COVID-related constraints. Conversations with dozens of medical experts, businesses and local leaders in both host cities reveal some of the hopes and fears surrounding the conventions this year. \"If you have infinite resources and a really good plan, it's possible,\" said Dr. James Conway, an infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Global Health Institute. He recommended testing attendees and workers at the convention site and other businesses, along with screening for temperatures, frequent and thorough cleaning of event spaces, \"abundant\" hand sanitizer, social distancing and masks. \"We need to make sure that we're walking the walk and making sure that everyone is safe,\" said Angela Lang, executive director of the Milwaukee group Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. \"If that means not having an in-person convention and not risking the health and safety specifically of black and brown communities, we need to do that as a party.\" Joe Gass is the CEO of Heritage Printing Signs & Displays, a veteran-owned business based in Charlotte, D.C. and southern Maryland. He says despite the pandemic, he is extremely excited about the impending gathering and that he has no doubt his community will find \"innovative solutions\" to overcome any challenges. \"Whether it's the political leaders, whether it's the health care leaders and providers, whether it's the business community \u2014 Charlotte is known for being extremely innovative and figuring out how can we do these things not only okay, but with excellence.\" North Carolina businessman Eric Burg, who is the CEO of Apple Rock Displays company added, \"America needs to show how to do this the right way so that we can do the other things like concerts and things that we should have in our lives.\" Burg continued, \"There are ways to do this and everyone knows how to do it, you just have to conquer your fear and be able to get comfortable with it.\" Read more\u00a0here.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN During a briefing with reporters on Friday, Joe Biden's top campaign staff gave no indication on how soon Biden may physically return to the campaign trail. They also for the first time laid out their ground game strategy to best President Trump in November,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0report. Regarding traveling, Biden's campaign manager said safety is their top priority for Biden and the large contingent who follow him on the campaign trail including his staff, Secret Service agents and reporters. Asked whether there are plans to test Biden for COVID-19, senior staffers said there was no current plan to test him. Biden's team also laid out their general election map, calling the election a \"referendum\" on Mr. Trump and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon and strategist Mike Donilon said their Electoral College strategy will focus on all or parts of 17 states. This includes protecting Democratic-friendly states like Virginia, Minnesota, and Colorado, and focusing on \"winning back\" states in the Rust Belt, Florida and North Carolina. The Biden campaign also said they are trying to expand the electoral map to historically conservative states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas. \"I'm bullish about Arizona. Arizona is a battleground state for the first time,\" O'Malley Dillon said.\u00a0 Read more about the\u00a0Biden's campaign strategy here. PRESIDENT TRUMP In its first wave of anti-Biden attack ads, the Trump campaign barraged Facebook this week,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. Messages reading \"Joe Biden, too old?\" and \"He's how old?\" poked fun at the Democratic rival's 77 years. Mr. Biden is four years older than Mr. Trump. The campaign has tested over 2,000 Facebook advertisements targeting the former Vice President this week alone, including unfounded messages questioning the longtime lawmaker's mental acuity. A CNN poll released this week shows voters divided over which presidential contender possesses the stamina and sharpness required to occupy the Oval Office (49% say Trump, while 46% say Biden.) Yet Biden outshined Mr. Trump on other surveyed attributes \u2013 55% of those surveyed say the former Vice President would unite the country, compared to 38% for Trump.\u00a0 The president announced \"Operation Warp Speed\" Friday, the federal government's new initiative to develop and identify an effective vaccine,\u00a0CBSNews.com White House Reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0reports. The president told reporters in the White House Rose Garden on Friday that he believes they're going to have a vaccine in the \"pretty near future,\" by the end of the year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also said a vaccine should be available to the public by January. However, experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert, say a vaccine will take 12-18 months to develop. \"Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back,\" the president said. A\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0released Thursday shows 43% of Americans think the president is doing a good job handling the virus, down from 48% in April and 53% in March. Most Americans also don't trust the president for information about the virus, the poll found. Only 38% of Americans said they do, compared with 61% who trust their governor and 62% who trust Fauci.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN The Government Accountability Office has agreed to launch a review of the Department of Veterans Affairs' oversight of care quality at State Veterans Homes following a request led by Senator Elizabeth Warren for it to do so.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports Warren, along with Democratic Senators Jon Tester, Edward Markey and Bob Casey, had requested the audit at the beginning of the month. They cited surging veteran deaths at state-run veterans homes during the COVID-19 pandemic and Government Accountability Office reports that the VA could improve its oversight of the facilities. \"Our veterans are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus, and they deserve the very best care during this public health emergency,\" Warren said in a statement. \"The GAO's decision to investigate VA's oversight of our State Veterans Homes is a good step toward improving the quality of care for our veterans and preventing future outbreaks at facilities in Massachusetts and nationwide.\" SEEING RED After initial uncertainty over how the coronavirus could impact political fundraising, WinRed, the platform used by a growing number of Republican candidates to raise funds, announced it brought in nearly $60 million in April alone. That's nearly half of the $130 million WinRed raised during the first three months of the year combined. The April cash haul came from more than 1.6 million donations. The average donation was $37, about $2 less than the average donation seen during the first quarter of the year. Last month, WinRed also saw its biggest day of fundraising ever in its 10-month history on April 30. While the last day of the month tends to see a spike in donations as candidates make final pitches to boost their numbers, WinRed raised $7.1 million that day. April was also the first month where campaigning and fundraising had to be conducted 100% online. According to WinRed's Gerrit Lansing, when the coronavirus first started to force campaigns to cancel in-person events and move online in March, fundraising numbers were not perhaps as big as they could have been that month, but he is actually surprised there was not a bigger dip. \"We seem to be seeing a lot of resiliency and energy,\" he said. Among its April donors, WinRed also had more than 61,000 end up using the platform to sign up to volunteer as well. This comes as campaigns and grassroots organizations across the country have to rethink their organizing strategy moving into the summer and fall due to the pandemic. Right now, more than 800 campaigns are using WinRed to raise funds as the platform continues to grow to compete with Democrats' ActBlue. ActBlue has not yet released specifics on its April fundraising, but an official tells\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0it did see strong fundraising numbers across the board last month whether it was for candidates up and down the ballots or progressive organizations. In January of 2019, ActBlue said it expected to hit a $3 billion mark for the 2020 cycle. It is still on track to hit that number by the end of the election cycle come November. MICHIGAN The Michigan Court of Claims heard oral arguments on the Michigan legislature's lawsuit challenging Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer's executive orders extending the state of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the legislature did not extend the state of emergency at the end of April, but Whitmer declared a state of emergency, citing two laws, the Emergency Powers of Governor Act from 1945 and the Emergency Management Act of 1976 that grant her the authority to extend the state of emergency without the legislature's approval. Michael Williams, who represented the Michigan legislature, argued that Whitmer does not have emergency powers under the 1976 law, which states that legislative approval is required to extend a state of emergency, because the legislature did not extend the state of emergency. Williams said legislative approval is important because it allows for the legislature to provide a check on executive power. \"If a governor is really going to assert that degree of broad power, that degree of just generalized, all-encompassing power, there needs to be some mechanism by which the people's legislators can say, 'No, we're ready to take the reins. We are ready to be the ones to actually reassume the lawmaking power,'\" Williams explained. Chris Allen, an assistant solicitor general in Michigan, argued that Whitmer has a duty to act during an emergency if an emergency still exists. \"There is no dispute that a disaster and emergency exist, yet the legislature withheld,\" Allen said. \"And they can do that under the statute. I'm not saying that they were statutorily obligated to do so, but they didn't. That does not remove the governor's duty to declare if the conditions warrant it.\" In regards to the 1945 emergency powers law, which grants the governor with the authority to issue \"reasonable orders\" without legislative approval, Williams argued that the 1945 law pertains to local emergencies instead of statewide emergencies. Allen said the broad language in the 1945 emergency powers law allows the governor to act during a public emergency \"to bring the emergency under control.\" NEVADA True the Vote has\u00a0renewed its push in federal court to roll back Nevada's upcoming all-mail primary after a judge last month\u00a0rejected their initial motion. New plaintiffs in the suit now include Nevada Right-to-Life, whose members \"intend to vote in the coming primary but fear disenfranchisement.\" Molly Forgey, a spokesperson for state Democrats, fired back\u00a0in a statement, \"The GOP's amended complaint adds nothing to its already-failed Nevada case, and only highlights that voter suppression is its sole electoral strategy during this grave public health crisis.\" In fact, while Democrats\u00a0last month moved to intervene in the legal battle, the GOP has not sought to join True the Vote's lawsuit. However Republicans in the state\u00a0have decried changes to the June contest in the state's most populous county, which True the Vote cites as one of the key factors for their latest effort in court. \"We've got now a classic Bush v. Gore situation where we have one set of standards for voting in one county versus in all the other counties in the state,\" James Bopp, True the Vote's attorney, tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"People have a general opinion that most of the corruption in Nevada is in Clark County. And now they've agreed with the Democrats to disregard state laws and increase their vote, and make them an even heavier player in the state. So there's no question that has exacerbated the situation,\" added Bopp. ATTACK MODE In competitive House and Senate races across the country, some Republican groups have been seizing on former Senate staffer Tara Reade's sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden to denounce their Democratic rivals. Through press releases and social media posts, conservative groups have launched a flurry of attacks targeting candidates in competitive races, both for not weighing in on the topic or for standing by their party's presumptive nominee, and calling on reporters to ask Democrats where they stand on the accusations, report\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, campaign reporter Alex Tin,\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. \"@RepFletcher frequently called out her opponent for \"inaction\" on sexual assault in the last election. Now Lizzie is dead silent about the new court docs corroborating Tara Read's sexual assault claim against @JoeBiden,\" the Congressional Leadership Fund\u00a0tweeted\u00a0last week about freshman House Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. The post is one of dozens of tweets from the group, a super PAC tied to Republican leadership in the U.S. House, criticizing 2020 Democratic candidates over Reade's allegations, which Biden has denied. But if GOP-affiliated groups haven't been shy about slamming Democrats because they're not confronting Biden over the accusations, they're being selective about where they're posting their attacks. On Facebook, where the super PAC spent on dozens of political ads in Christy Smith's special election race in California's 25th District, none made any mention of Reade or Biden. Mr. Trump's campaign has released videos and statements blasting Democrats over Tara Reade, but has yet to commit any funds to boost their ads on the topic. The president, who himself has faced multiple accusations of sexual assault, has mostly avoided the topic. When asked about the allegation, Mr. Trump has said that Biden should \"just go out and fight it.\"\u00a0Read more here. CLYBURN CALL TO ACTION Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina issued a call to action and warned Democrats the 2020 election will be one the most consequential of his lifetime, according to\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. \"I'm really, really nervous about this election,\" Clyburn stated. \"This coming November will be the most consequential election in this country in a century.\" The 79-year-old House Majority Whip made the comments during a virtual DNC town hall Thursday night. The event, entitled Making the American Dream Accessible and Affordable for Black Men, focused on the upcoming election and the economic challenges facing the African-American community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clyburn cited a recent poll that showed presumptive nominee Joe Biden leading nationally but trailing in key battleground states. Clyburn also pointed to 13% of f African-American men who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. \"This election will be won not in the popular vote but Electoral College, so we've got to pay close attention to that 13%,\" said Clyburn, who was instrumental in Biden's comeback in South Carolina. \"This is going to be different this year. We probably won't be able to knock on doors. We may not even be able to sit down in big gatherings. We're going to have to use our telephones, our devices to turn out the vote.\" Other panelists included DNC Vice Chair Michael Blake, Associate Chair and U.S. Senate candidate Jaime Harrison and Democratic strategist and\u00a0CBS News political contributor Antjuan Seawright. The discussion was part of the DNC's \"Chop It Up\" series \u2013 a joint initiative of the DNC and DNC Black Caucus to engage African-American men in politics.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE A $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill was on the\u00a0docket Friday for the House, meant to assist state and local governments, hazard pay for medical workers, forgiveness of student debt and bolstering Medicaid and Medicare. Known as the HEROES Act (Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act), the bill was introduced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday and received opposition from most Republicans and some Democrats. Progressives like Congresswomen Pramila Jayapal and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez felt that the bill could go further for workers and shoring up healthcare. Republican Congressman Peter King of New York said before the vote that he would break party lines and support the bill,\u00a0 saying it provides much-needed aid for state and local governments in his state. \"This is no place for politics. There's a lot in the bill that I disagree with, but Mitch McConnell refuses to bring up aid to state and local governments. New York will absolutely collapse if that aid money is not there,\" King told\u00a0Fox News.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says freshmen House Democrats Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Kendra Horn of Oklahoma all signaled Friday they'd be voting against the bill. All of these members are in competitive districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016. In his weekly briefing, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy appealed to these moderate members. \"There are 42 other seats that Democrats sit in, that have a better opportunity for Republicans to win than the seat we just won Tuesday night,\" he said, referencing\u00a0Tuesday's special election\u00a0in California's 25th district. \"And what is Nancy Pelosi doing? Twisting the arm of Democrats, forcing them to vote for a bill that is a liberal wish list that will not become law.\" McCarthy also addressed whether Congressman Steve King of Iowa, who was stripped of his committee assignments due to racist remarks, could return to those assignments. King previously suggested he had McCarthy's word to reclaim his assignments, something McCarthy shot down on Friday, leaving it up to the House GOP Steering Committee to hear King's case. The House GOP leader also said he has not taken a position on King's competitive Republican primary against State Senator Randy Feenstra. \"The constituents have a decision to make and they can make their own decision,\" he said.\u00a0 IN THE SENATE In one of the country's most-watched Senate races, Republicans have ramped up attacks on Democrat Mark Kelly after a\u00a0RealClearPolitics report detailed\u00a0Chinese investment in a venture co-founded by Kelly. The company, World View Enterprises, has rejected accusations of foreign influence, pointing out to\u00a0the Arizona Republic\u00a0that the Pentagon cleared the firm of foreign interference concerns.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports Kelly is seeking to unseat Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, who\u00a0in an ad released today\u00a0doubled down on a campaign that has increased its focus on China. McSally in recent weeks has\u00a0proposed bills\u00a0to curb Beijing's influence, predicted \"a\u00a0new Cold War\" with China, vowed to \"never\u00a0back down to Communists\" after a Chinese state-run outlet suggested she might face sanctions, and praised a recent Taiwanese investment\u00a0in the state. \"I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Martha McSally \u2014 a fantastic person. \u00a0Fantastic person,\" Mr. Trump said about the Republican earlier this month,\u00a0during his visit to the state. \"She's fighting to uncover the full truth about the China situation and how the World Health Organization handled the outbreak and what happened.\"",

            "article_content": "The stakes are high for all of the candidates ahead of Tuesday's Democratic debate in South Carolina, co-hosted by CBS News. But they're especially high for Joe Biden. The former vice president had a substantial lead in the state, but has dropped in recent polls, notably among the state's black voters who make up about 60% of Democrats here. Black voters, campaign organizers and veteran volunteers said the campaign is as competitive as ever. One group of now mostly senior citizen organizers, known as The Reckoning Crew, initially endorsed Senator Kamala Harris. After she suspended her campaign, the group made headlines for backing Biden. The group's founder, Bernice Scott, is a force in South Carolina politics. Whether she's organizing volunteers at her home, greeting people door-to-door or adding emphasis through a bullhorn on a Biden campaign bus, her voice is a trusted one in the state.   Asked why she called the group the Reckoning Crew, Scott told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King, \"Because if you don't do what's right by the people, you have to reckon with us.\"\u00a0  \"What is it about Joe Biden that you feel a personal connection to?\" King asked Scott. \"Because our country is so far back now. So Joe Biden worked for eight years with Barack Obama. \u2026 We need somebody who can hit the ground running,\" Scott said. The former vice president had a formidable lead in South Carolina. But according to a new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, his support among the state's black voters fell from 54% in November to 35%.\u00a0  \"Are you concerned about what's going to happen to your candidate of choice in South Carolina?\" King asked. \"No, not really,\" Scott said. \"Because all we can do as the Reckoning Crew is take the message to the people. And if a train is coming down the track, and I tell you to get off the track \u2026 and you don't move, I could feel good knowing I told you.\"  Biden's drop in the polls offers his Democratic rivals greater expectations for the next primary. At the University of South Carolina in Columbia, some young organizers are pulling for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. One of the Buttigieg campaign organizers was Walter A. Clyburn Reed, the grandson of South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn. \"So your grandfather, Congressman Clyburn, has been on the record as saying that Mayor Pete's sexual orientation will be a problem for some voters. He said, he's not necessarily talking about himself, but he said, many voters in South Carolina, black voters in particular, that that would be a problem,\" King said to Walter.  \"He was referring to his generation in particular \u2026 He understands that our nation is progressing,\" Walter said. \"He also understands \u2026 how much that that community \u2026 has a positive effect on not only American society, but eventually American politics.\" One Sanders organizer was just 16 years old.  Asked what it is about politics that fascinates him, Alex Blocker said, \"As I grew up, I realized that politics is going to affect me and everybody else. \u2026 And so when I was witnessing the 2016 election, that's when I really found out that it matters who you vote for.\"  Asked why he settled on Sanders, Blocker said, \"He's a candidate who has fought for the civil rights movement. As far as \u2026 policies like Medicare for All, getting money out of politics, and ending that overseas wars. \u2026 'Cause that's what I would run on if I could run.\" Elizabeth Warren supporter Zainab Dossaji told King she believes the stakes are higher in this election than the last presidential election.  \"Because the last four years, so many people have been so afraid of where this country is headed, and I think, you know, Elizabeth Warren says it herself, 'This is the fight of our lives,'\" Dossaji said.  Asked what he thought when people view voters of color as a monolithic group, Walter said, \"That is very untrue. \u2026 We all have different viewpoints \u2026 and in this election in particular, we have a lot of candidates who have a lot to offer.\"  At a family fun run in the state's capitol, voters seemed to agree the race for the Democratic nomination in South Carolina remains wide open. \"We still have more time. I still have more time to change my mind. I'm still researching and so we'll see,\" Renada Chisholm said.   Asked if the debates matter to her, Chisholm said they do.  \"They matter a lot,\" she said. \"'Cause you can't retract what you said in front of millions of watchers. \u2026 How are you appealing to the African-American voters?\"  \"I keep hearing that,\" King said.\u00a0   \"That's a huge part of the voters,\" Chisholm said. \"Especially in this community.\"   \"It's like 60% black they're saying,\" King said.   \"Yeah. So that's important. I need to know,\" Chisholm said.",

            "article_content": "DECORAH, Iowa \u2013 With four days until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 Buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. His attacks on Biden and Sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind Biden and Sanders, albeit narrowly.\u00a0 \"I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\" Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. \"But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\" Buttigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors \"Medicare for All\" and free college tuition at public universities. Buttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating Sanders would be a \"risk\" at a time when Democrats are desperate to reclaim the White House from President Trump.\u00a0 \"I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts,\" Buttigieg continued. \"And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.\" Buttigieg has remained in the top tier of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. The most recent Des Moines Register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely Iowa caucus-goers while Sanders was the first choice of 20%. The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support.\u00a0 The millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to \"show versus tell\" that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th. He hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in Nevada and South Carolina, where is currently polling well behind Sanders and Biden.\u00a0 While maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, Buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between Sanders and Biden over Social Security. The Vermont senator has accused Biden of being open to cutting Social Security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.\u00a0 \"This is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before,\" Buttigieg said. \"The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better.\" After his town hall in Decorah, Buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for.\u00a0 \"We're competing,\" Buttigieg told reporters. \"It's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. I admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.\" CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "\"CBS This Morning\" explores how issues on the campaign trail actually affect people around the country with our series Every State has a Story.\u00a0 Almost 15 percent of workers in Nevada belong to labor unions, making the organizations prominent in state politics. The Nevada Culinary Workers Union, one of the most powerful forces, has 60,000 members \u2014 over half of them Latino \u2014 and represents most hospitality workers on the Las Vegas Strip.\u00a0 Health care is the union's greatest concern going into the presidential election and the\u00a0Nevada caucuses on Saturday. Nevada has one of the worst health care systems in the country, according to a recent report by the Commonwealth Fund. The state was ranked last in the nation for prevention and treatment, and second to last for access and affordability. The Culinary Workers Union, however, has its own health care system that many members worry could be threatened by Medicare for All. The union has distributed flyers warning that Medicare for All plans would threaten members' current coverage.\u00a0 \"Every human being needs and deserve to have better health care. \u2026 But at the same time we believe in choices,\" said Geoconda Arguello-Kline, who has been in the Culinary Workers Union for 36 years and is secretary-treasurer. \"We feel very important to keep our own health care because we have the best health care in Nevada.\"   Employers pay into the culinary union's health fund, which supports its own private health center for members and their 70,000 dependents.\u00a0 Union member Lino Paredes, who works at Caesar's Palace, is voting for the first time.\u00a0 \"I just had a baby. My wife just had a c-section and you guys know how expensive that is, right? I didn't have to worry much because I knew I was covered by my insurance,\" he said. The concern, however, has created conflicting views on health care among the state's union members. Yarleny Roa-Dugan, a 31-year-old mother, immigrant and nurse, said she supports Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. She told CBS News contributor Maria Elena Salinas that, as a voter, one of her main concerns is health care, and that she supports Medicare for All. \"I think most of us can agree that even if you have health insurance, the costs make it very difficult,\" Roa-Dugan said. \"As a labor and delivery nurse, I see women that come in without any prenatal care \u2026 we can see issues with the babies that we otherwise would have been able to fix or prevent \u2026 It's very hard.\" Roa-Dugan's union, which represents health care and public service employees, will also play a role in Nevada's caucuses.\u00a0 About 137 million Americans faced financial hardship last year because of medical costs, according to the Journal of General Internal Medicine. High health care bills are the No. 1 reason people take money out of their retirement accounts or file for bankruptcy.\u00a0 All the Democratic presidential candidates have visited Nevada's culinary union to share their platforms.\u00a0 Some have seized on the Culinary Workers Union's concern, and promised that the union's health care would not be put in jeopardy under their presidency. Others, like Bernie Sanders, have argued that switching to government health care could help them fight for higher wages. \"Employers save money under our legislation, workers get the difference,\" Sanders said. When asked by CBS about the union's fears, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she wants the whole country to have health care as good as the union's system.\u00a0\"I want to see health care centers like that available not just for the culinary union, I want to see them available all across Nevada and across this country,\" she said.\u00a0Regardless of the outcome this weekend, Roa-Dugan said she's proud to be participating. \"I think every vote counts. So my vote is very important and I am encouraging all my friends and family to vote too,\" she said.",

You're getting nervous, man! Calm down, it's OK,\" said a spirited Biden. \"He apologized for saying I was corrupt. He didn't say anything about whether I was telling the truth about social security.\" Earlier this week, Sanders\u00a0apologized\u00a0after one of his supporters wrote an op-ed calling Biden corrupt. On Tuesday, Biden accepted Sanders' apology, but just hours later, his campaign released a video on Twitter going after Sanders for \"negative attacks\" on his record on Social Security. Sanders then punched back, renewing the charge that when Biden was a senator, he was open to cutting benefits. Sanders, who was off the campaign trail and in Washington for day two of the impeachment trial, was asked about Biden questioning his vote against the Brady Bill, a piece of gun control legislation from the 1990s.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says Sanders told reporters that Biden is a friend and that the campaign is about discussing issues. \u00a0 \"Biden wants to look at my record, that's fair. I will look at his record. We'll have that debate,\" said Sanders. CALIFORNIA After a vote among its membership, another California union has thrown its support this week behind Bernie Sanders.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says 66 percent of UPTE-CWA Local 9119, whose contracts encompass more than 16,000 University of California employees,\u00a0voted to back Sanders this month. The announcement comes as\u00a0Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a former Kamala Harris backer, says\u00a0he has thrown his support behind Joe Biden. SOCIAL SECURITY The leading Democratic presidential candidates have sparred in recent days over records on social security. The Sanders campaign has shared a video of Biden on the Senate floor in 1995 talking about his past efforts to freeze entitlement programs, including Social Security. In 1995, Bill Clinton was president and trying to balance the federal budget. It was a time when a number of politicians \u2014 Republicans, along with centrist Democrats \u2014 thought it would be prudent to cut the nation's spending and secure the future of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\u00a0 At the time, Biden was among the deficit hawks who agreed with that approach,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Biden is now pledging he won't cut Social Security or Medicare if he's elected, and would in fact even increase benefits for some. According to his\u00a0campaign website, Biden would provide a bigger benefit for the oldest Americans. Workers who spent 30 years of working would receive a benefit of at least 125% of the poverty level.\u00a0 During a Vice News forum on Monday, he also proposed increasing the cap on the payroll tax income that's subject to Social Security taxes, which is something that Warren and Sanders have both advocated for. Meanwhile, in an interview with\u00a0CNBC, President Trump said he would take a look at entitlements down the road even though he promised on the campaign trail in 2016 not to change\u00a0Social Security\u00a0or\u00a0Medicare.\u00a0 ON THE $$$ The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that it's scaling up its investment in six battleground states to lay the groundwork for the eventual Democratic presidential nominee and down-ballot candidates ahead of the general election.\u00a0 The DNC will be focusing its multi-million dollar push starting in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona, all of which are states President Trump won in 2016.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the \"Battleground Build-Up 2020\" plan will roughly double the number of on-the-ground field organizers across the six states and allow them to open additional offices in each state. The DNC is working in coordination with state parties and aims to have hundreds of staff on the ground by March.\u00a0 DNC officials hope the efforts will allow the eventual nominee to scale up his or her operation quickly to be able to take on President Trump and provide multiple potential pathways to victory. \"We are taking nothing for granted as we work to make Trump a one-term president and win up and down the ballot in 2020,\" said DNC Chair Tom Perez in a statement. This comes just over a week after the progressive group Priorities USA announced it is also expanding its pre-convention budget and will begin running TV ads in Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania starting in February and March. They hope the ads will counter Mr. Trump's spending in battleground states while Democratic candidates are busy with their primary.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Maryland's special election for Congressman Elijah Cummings 7th district is less than two weeks away, and Democrats are seeking to distinguish themselves amongst a field of 24 candidates. Cummings died in October 2019, leaving the seat vacant.\u00a0 Kweisi Mfume, who represented the district from 1987 to 1996, was endorsed by Baltimore County Council member Julian Jones Wednesday morning, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"In these trying times in Washington D.C. with all the challenges that we face, it's very important that we have a person with the experience knowledge, commitment, to be able to go there and hit the ground running and represent our community well,\" Jones said. Former Maryland Democratic Party Chair and Cummings' widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, isalso\u00a0 running for the seat and held a lunch fundraiser in D.C. on Wednesday. In an appearance on ABC's \"The View\" this week, Rockeymoore Cummings said her late husband expected her to \"continue the fight\" and that \"on several occasions he told me that he thought that I should, you know, run for his seat. And I never wanted to engage that conversation because you know that meant that he wouldn't be here,\" she said. \"We have hordes of women who are running to take office...I am a part of that vanguard of people who are seeking to build on the legacy left by Elijah Cummings.\" Both candidates took part in a primary debate along with five other contenders on Monday.\u00a0The Baltimore Sun\u00a0reported that Rockeymoore Cummings was asked about her late husband's daughters supporting Harry Spikes, a longtime aide to Cummings, and not her. In response, Rockeymoore Cummings said she was glad \"they are focused on having their voices heard in this debate.\"\u00a0 Mfume was asked about his affair with a staffer when he was head of the NAACP, and said that while he was single at the time he regretted the relationship.\u00a0 The special election's primary is on February 4, with a general election in the heavily-Democratic district on April 28. Meanwhile in Utah, Thom Carter, executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, declined a run against Democratic Congressman Ben McAdams. In a statement, Carter said, \"After many late nights and much discussion, we have decided that now isn't the right time to enter the race for Congress.\"\u00a0 KSL.com\u00a0reports that Carter was being encouraged to run by the Republican National Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee. McAdams raised close to $900,000 in the fourth quarter, and with Carter's announcement on Wednesday, state representative Kim Coleman and former Utah GOP communications adviser Kathleen Anderson are among the top Republican contenders for the seat.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 As Democrats reckon with losing seats in the House of Representatives after predicting their majority in the upper chamber would grow this election, Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond, a Democrat, said Sunday that slogans such as \"defund the police\" ultimately hurt the party. \"Some titles hurt,\" Richmond said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\" \"'Defunding the police' is a title that hurts Democrats, especially when the fact of the matter is nobody is calling for defunding the police. We're calling for reinventing how we police communities in this country, how we do criminal justice.\" Richmond was asked about complaints made by moderate Democrats during a heated call\u00a0with Democratic leaders last week, the details of which were leaked to members of the press. Some House members who narrowly won their districts spoke of how messages like \"defund the police,\" pushed by progressive lawmakers in the caucus, damaged their campaigns and cost vulnerable freshmen their seats. The Louisiana Democrat, who is a co-chair of the Biden campaign, said the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is \"very important\" to the party, but noted \"no matter how progressive your ideals and values are and what you want to do and how bold your plans are, if we don't win, if we don't keep the majority of the house, you cannot implement any of those plans.\" \"We have to make sure we can win first and govern second,\" he said. Richmond added that \"words have consequences.\" \"In this election, those words cost us some Democratic members,\" he said. West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, also lamented how the positions pushed by the progressive wing of the party hurt his colleagues in the House and said Democrats allowed their Republican opponents to cast them as \"socialists\" even though \"that's not who we are and it's not what we're about.\" Claims from the GOP that Democrats would push socialist policies, he said, \"basically scared the bejesus out of people.\"\u00a0 \"I have fought against that. Joe Biden has fought against that,\" Manchin said. \"We're not for New Green Deal. We're not for all the things that he's  talked about, Medicare for all. We can't even pay for Medicare for some. We've got to take care of a lot of things.\" Looking ahead to the next Congress, Manchin said Democrats need to govern from the \"moderate middle,\" and expected Mr. Biden will work to foster bipartisanship with Republicans in the Senate. \"I would encourage all Democrats  to be moderate, find the middle if you can,\" he said. \"We're not going to be able to govern from the extremes or from the fringes. Never have been.\" Democrats controlled 232 House seats in the 116h Congress, and while they are likely to maintain a majority in the House, they will do so with fewer members. Control of the Senate, meanwhile, hangs in the balance as two races in Georgia are likely headed to runoff elections. While Richmond acknowledged the impact rhetoric pushed by progressives had on the larger party, he said he believes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should retain her position. The California Democrat asked her colleagues in a letter Friday to support her bid for speaker in January.",

First, Biden said he now favors dropping the Medicare eligibility age by five years, to age 60, a step toward the Vermont senator's marquee single-payer plan, \"Medicare for All.\" The campaign describes this as an effort to present older Americans who are working and not yet at retirement age to have the benefits of the popular government program. The campaign says the additional costs would \"be financed out of general revenues to protect the Medicare Trust Fund.\" Second, Biden wants to forgive student loan debt for those earning up to $125,000, who attended public colleges, Historically Black Colleges or Universities, or private minority-serving institutions. The plan would address all current student debt and future debt if the borrower is eligible, the campaign confirmed to CBS News. While no cost has been quoted in this plan, similar plans by Biden's former primary rivals were criticized for their high sticker price. The Biden campaign said the new loan forgiveness would be funded by targeting and repealing the \"excess business losses\" tax cut in the recently-passed COVID-relief plan called the CARES Act. The campaign argued this tax cut does not address the current pandemic relief efforts and the \"richest Americans\" are the main beneficiaries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden said the government should cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person, an idea floated by another former rival, Elizabeth Warren. On Tuesday, Biden said he hoped Sanders would be a part of \"the journey,\" and CBS News reported previously the Biden and Sanders campaigns for the last several weeks have discussed policy initiatives and how Sanders could impact the ongoing campaign.

            "article_content": "President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to combat coronavirus, reports CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. He called the national emergency \"two very big words.\" The president said this declaration will open access to up to $50 billion in resources to help states and localities. The declaration also gives doctors and hospitals more authority by waiving certain restrictions. One of the criticisms of the administration's response has been the lack of accessible testing. The president said there will be half a million tests available next week. He gave his remarks in the Rose Garden flanked by executives of companies like Target, Walmart and CVS, who have pledged support.\u00a0In his remarks on Friday, Mr. Trump reemphasized his announcement during Wednesday's Oval Office address that the U.S. will suspend the entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last 14 days and U.S. citizens coming back from the area will go through extra screening and self-isolation. The president said he would release a paper Friday night detailing extra steps. BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders argued Friday that the coronavirus crisis proves the need for Medicare for All, reports CBS campaign reporter Cara Korte. He said that through this crisis, more Americans will be convinced that a single-payer system would make crises like this more manageable if everyone has health care.\u00a0Sanders took questions on Friday. CBS News asked if there had been any conversations between the Democratic National Committee and his campaign about potentially postponing primaries. Sanders said delaying elections should not be done 'willy nilly\" but the decision lies with public health officials.\u00a0The senator confessed that the outbreak has \"significantly impacted campaign\" but is hopeful that his camp's strong online presence will bolster support is this odd time.\u00a0Sanders was also asked if the president should get tested. Sanders said yes. He also added that he feels good and has not been in contact with anyone who has shown symptoms so he himself has not gotten tested, but if he wasn't feeling well, he would get tested.\u00a0He was asked how he reacts to Joe Biden's coronavirus plan that includes a call to \"spend whatever it takes\" to prevent the virus from spreading and if that was frustrating to hear given Biden's opposition to Medicare for All. Sanders said he wouldn't use the word frustrating, but said that the crisis highlights the \"absurdity and dysfunctionality\" of the current health care system. As the United States grapples with how to contain the spread of coronavirus and related health concerns, state and party leaders are taking actions ahead of critical presidential primaries this month, as well as making plans for future contests should the dangers persist. Here's how officials in states across the country are taking action:\u00a0LOUISIANALouisiana Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards has signed a proclamation moving the state's upcoming presidential primary from April 4 to June 20 due to coronavirus, reports CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The move was recommended by Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin.\u00a0\"Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring. While hurricanes, floods and tornadoes are at the forefront of all Louisianans minds, the threat we face from the COVID-19 virus is an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced,\" Ardoin said.\u00a0This will also move municipal general elections from May 9 to July 25. The Secretary of State's office has moved elections before due to hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. The Democratic National Committee responded to the move saying it would violate party rules, according to Watson. The DNC's rules say that state contests are supposed to be completed by June 9 and delegates need to be elected by June 20.\u00a0\"We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,\" A DNC spokesperson said in a statement. \"This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9th. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee.\"\u00a0Louisiana State Senator Karen Carter Peterson, the state's Democratic Party chair, said the state party will work with Louisiana's Governor and Secretary of State and the DNC to \"ensure every Louisianan has the chance to make their voice heard.\"\u00a0\"We are hopeful the Democratic National Committee will work with us to revise our Delegate Selection Plan to make sure our state is fully represented in this year's nominating contest. Louisiana Democrats are committed to preserving the health of our neighbors while ensuring the voices of hundreds of thousands of Louisianans are heard,\" Peterson said in a statement.\u00a0MARCH 17 PRIMARY STATES: ARIZONA, FLORIDA, ILLINOIS, OHIO CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports that the four states involved in next Tuesday's primaries are expected to be going forward as planned, according to a statement issued by the Secretaries of State from Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.\u00a0\"Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,\" the statement said. \"We are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday.\"\u00a0CBS News reached out to more than a half-dozen county supervisors of elections throughout Florida and none had heard of any discussions regarding the postponement of the state's primary scheduled for Tuesday. According to the Florida Department of Health, there are at least 50 cases of coronavirus in the state involving 45 Florida residents and 6 non-residents. 221 tests are pending results in the state. On the heels of Louisiana postponing its state primary, Secretaries of State Kathy Hobbs (Arizona), Laurel Lee (Florida), Frank LaRose (Ohio) and Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz (Illinois) said in they haven't received information that leads them to believe that voters and poll workers are in jeopardy.\u00a0\"Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday.\"\u00a0Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley told CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell in an email that while this is a \"difficult situation,\" this isn't the first time the state has had to \"face adversity.\"\u00a0\"Just look back to 2018 with Hurricane Michael or 2004 with Hurricane Charley,\" said Earley in an email. \"At this point we anticipate all polling sites will be open on election day. We have plans in place in case those facts change.\"\u00a0Volusia County Supervisor of Elections Lisa Lewis told Mitchell that her county would also be prepared if the state did decided to postpone but also expressed concerns about how the virus could impact voter turnout.\u00a0\"I do feel that it may potentially yes make it a lower turnout than what we had actually anticipated. [Early voting] is lower than what we had in 2016,\" said Lewis. She added that if the state did decide to postpone the primary, they would be prepared to make the necessary adjustments. \"We're not planning for that [and] that had not crossed my mind before but I could see that it happens, especially after we hear that the Louisiana did the same.\"\u00a0The Secretary of State offices in Illinois and Arizona both told Navarro that a potential cancellation or postponement would have to come from the state legislative chambers. \"There is no legal authority for canceling an election, our governor made a disaster declaration this week but even that does not give him the authority to postpone an election or move an election day, that's set in statute,\" Illinois Secretary of State spokesperson Matt Dietrich said. He added that they will talk about a potential mandatory mail ballot vote, an idea that's been floated for Maryland's primaries, but only after next Tuesday's primaries. Still, Dietrich said coming to that conclusion could be challenging.\u00a0 \"It would be a lot more difficult, I think, for an election authority to go in and make a case that, 'We're going to not have voting on election day, we're shutting down our polling places, everything is by mail.' That's a pretty major policy decision. So this is something that I'm sure will be dealt with,\" he said. \"It could be worse in November. If that's if that's the case, we want to make sure that we have solid contingency plans.\"\u00a0Maricopa County Record Adrian Fontes in Arizona decided to send all ballots my mail to voters that \"typically vote on election day.\" In a statement, they explain that voters will just have to drop off the mail ballot vote without having to engage with other voters or staff- thought they cannot mail back the ballots themselves.\u00a0\"The Board of Supervisors is doing all they can to keep polling places open, staffed and clean and I applaud their efforts. But I felt this additional option was necessary to serve our voters,\" Fontes said.\u00a0IOWA The Iowa Democratic Party announced on Friday that it is postponing its county conventions March 21st due to the coronavirus. \"After extensive consultation with County Chairs, the State Central Committee, party leaders, and public health officials, we have come to the determination that the spreading coronavirus poses a risk that outweighs a temporary delay in moving the caucus-to-convention process forward,\" said Iowa Democratic Party Chair Mark Smith in a statement. \"Iowa Democrats should not have to choose between democratic participation and remaining in good health, and concerns for the well-being of our delegates, thousands of volunteers, workers at convention venues, and the public come first.\" Smith sayid the party will work to find a solution for rescheduling the conventions. At this point, Iowa's District and State Conventions are still planned to proceed as scheduled.\u00a0WYOMING Late Thursday night, the Wyoming Democratic Party announced it was suspending the in-person portion of the upcoming presidential caucuses that was scheduled for April 4. \"Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,\" said Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Joe M Barbuto in a statement. The state party is encouraging voters to vote by mail. Those ballots need to be postmarked by March 20. Voters can also drop off ballots at locations on March 28 and April 4. The deadline to register to vote to receive a ballot by mail has passed and ballots were mailed to registered Democrats automatically. The deadline to register to vote in the caucuses is March 20. The state also canceled its county convention delegates, so there won't be names of which delegates would be elected to the state convention on April 4. The party is working on a solution for rescheduling or finding a different way to do the county conventions.\u00a0ALASKA Alaska, which holds an in person primary on April 4, is encouraging voters to return their ballots by mail, according to Alaska Democratic Party Communications Director Jeanne Devon. The deadline to submit ballots by mail is March 24.\u00a0 At this point, there have not been any changes to in-person voting on April 4. \"We are paying close attention for guidance from local health authorities, and urge people \u2014 especially those in high-risk groups \u2014   to consider any and all exposure to public places, and to continue taking proper precautions,\" Devon told CBS News. \"We will continue to assess our plans on a daily basis as the situation unfolds,\"\u00a0WISCONSIN There are currently no discussions to move Wisconsin's April 7 presidential primary, according to Wisconsin Elections Public Information Officer Reid Magney. Magney said the decision was made yesterday for absentee ballots to be mailed to nursing homes and other areas with vulnerable populations rather than sending voting deputies and representatives from political parties. Additionally, local officials will be able to move polling locations currently scheduled to be held at nursing homes. Wisconsin officials are encouraging people who have concerns to request an absentee ballot online and vote by mail. The state has no-reason absentee voting. Ballots need to be postmarked by April 2 and need to be received by 8:00pm central time on April 7, when polls close in the state. They can also be hand delivered to some locations including a local clerk's office or satellite locations in some larger cities. Magney added that the state is in the process of offering guidelines for local clerks on primary day for sanitary practices and supplies that may be needed.\u00a0APRIL 28 PRIMARY STATES: CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE MARYLAND AND NEW YORK While the primaries for these four states are still more than six weeks away, talks are already underway about how to handle coronavirus. According to a spokesperson for the Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill's office, senior staff in that office are meeting on coronavirus response planning daily, are included in all of the Office of the Governor's planning calls for this issue, and are in regular contact with federal authorities, reports CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. They have also set up a working group with the leadership of the Registrars' and Town Clerks' Associations to \"ensure that both state and local election officials are on the same page when it comes to planning for the upcoming primary.\"\u00a0Absentee ballots in Connecticut will not be available until April 7 and cannot even be ordered by towns until March 24, but the Secretary of State's office has advised towns to expect heavy demand for such ballots. On Friday, Merrill issued guidance that absentee ballots should be made available to any Connecticut voter who wants to avoid a polling place due to coronavirus.\u00a0 Current state statutes allow voters to get absentee ballots because of \"his or her illness.\" Merrill has asked Governor Lamont to issue an Executive Order that would eliminate restrictive language in the statute during this emergency for the April 28 presidential primary. Following that executive order, voters to get absentee ballots because of \"illness.\"\u00a0\"Through surprise October snowstorms, November hurricanes, to the threat of a global pandemic \u2013 voting in Connecticut must go on,\" said Merrill in statement. \"The nature of COVID-19, or the coronavirus, is such that public health experts advise minimizing crowds and direct contact with other people. In order to ensure that Connecticut voters are able to cast a ballot on April 28th, absentee ballots must be available for voters who want to follow public health advice and avoid polling places.\"\u00a0At the same time, there are no talks of postponing Delaware's primary, State Elections Commissioner Anthony Albence told Ewall-Wice. According to the Commissioner, officials are working on getting materials in place to ensure polling places have right products they need to keep equipment clean and disinfected and there will be an emphasis on such measures in their poll worker training, so voters are confident they're keeping locations as clean as possible. Delaware does not have early voting, but it does have absentee voting for defined reasons as specified by state law including for being sick. Albence says his office has advised staff that there could be an uptick in absentee voting applications, so they're prepared as possible to process them. He says they will honor completed application that is received for outlined absentee reasons.\u00a0Meanwhile, the Maryland State Board of Elections is working with federal and state health agencies to monitor developments related to coronavirus. \"We appreciate that this is an evolving situation and are taking every appropriate step to deliver a safe and secure election for Maryland voters and election workers,\" read a statement from State Administrator of Elections for Maryland Linda Lamone when asked for comment. The SBE is reminding voters who prefer to vote from home that they can request an absentee ballot online. Maryland law allows \"no excuse\" absentee voting.\u00a0CBS News also reached out to the New York Board of Elections and is waiting to hear back. IN THE HOUSE In addition to disrupting presidential campaign schedules, House candidates have also seen a push for virtual and phone events in place of regular canvassing and rallies reports Navarro. Mike Garcia, a Republican candidate in California's 25th district, announced Friday that his campaign is switching to tele-town halls on the economy next week. \"Like everyone else across America, we are following the guidelines set forth by the CDC, but with an election only 60 days away, voters need to know where their candidates stand on the issues,\" Garcia said in a statement. Congresswoman Elaine Luria of Virginia announced that her town hall next week will be postponed, while some candidates like Mckayla Wilkes in Maryland's 5th district have stopped all door-to-door canvassing operations.\u00a0\u00a0Illinois' 3rd district candidate Marie Newman has her primary next Tuesday, and she said in a call with reporters today that she had to cancel her election night watch party. \"We have had to adapt. Mayor Lightfoot and Governor Pritzker have asked everybody to be very careful about their convening, and we are we are really adhering to that,\" she said in a call with EMILY's List. \"The campaign we're, you know, judicious about elbows and all of those things, maybe even a little bit of Irish dancing so that we keep our hands down. But we're trying to give everybody as much information in the district as possible and the district really appreciates that.\"",

            "article_content": "With six states holding contests on March 10, Michigan is the biggest delegate prize at stake in this next batch of primaries. Because of a 2018 ballot measure, Michigan now allows for absentee ballots without needing a reason, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. It has led to a spike in absentee ballot requests and returns. As of 8:00 p.m. ET on Thursday night, 599,644 absentee ballots had been returned of the 924,340 that were requested. Five days before the 2016 primary, when no-reason absentee voting was not allowed, 357,733 absentee ballots were returned of the 484,173 that were requested. Michigan law also allows people to \"spoil\" their ballot if the candidate they voted for dropped out or \"for any other reason.\" A voter can have a new ballot mailed to them or vote in person on Tuesday for a different candidate. As of 2:00 p.m. ET on Friday, the Secretary of State's office says there were 24,109 requests to spoil ballots, which would allow a voter who sent in an absentee ballot to recast his or her ballot. If a voter is spoiling their ballot by mail, the request must be received by 2:00 p.m. ET on Saturday. It can also be done in person at a clerk's office by 4:00 p.m. ET on Monday. And then there were two. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced its qualifications for the next Democratic presidential debate in Arizona on March 15, and it appears Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will be the only candidates qualified to participate, reports\u00a0CBS News political associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the new rules, candidates must have been allocated at least 20% of the total number of pledged delegates across all of the contests that will have taken place by 9 a.m. ET on the day of the debate. Those totals will be calculated by adding together all the delegates allocated by the Associated Press or CNN. While Tulsi Gabbard does have two delegates by CBS News' count so far, it does not appear likely that she will have received 20% of all delegates by the time of the debate, leaving Biden and Sanders the final two candidates to go face-to-face. The next debate takes place in Arizona two days before the state's Democratic primary, March 17. BERNIE SANDERS Sanders continued to stress that Biden's record does not hold up to the scrutiny, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. He specifically cited Biden's past votes on NAFTA, the Defense of Marriage Act, the Hyde Amendment and Medicaid.\u00a0 \"Now Trump lies all of the time. So despite what he is doing in his budget, he is claiming that he supports Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, which of course he does not,\" Sanders said at an airport gaggle. \"But he is already attacking Joe Biden, for the fact that Biden has been on the floor of the Senate in years past, calling for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans programs as a part of a Bowles Simpson approach and balanced budget efforts. And these are issues that Trump will certainly be emphasizing in the campaign.\" CBS News political broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0adds that the line of attack comes after a strong showing from Biden on Super Tuesday, essentially leaving it to a two-man race between Sanders and Biden. When asked about if he can expand his electorate, Sanders said he has a \"unique campaign\" and that the healthcare industry \"was very excited because Joe did well on Super Tuesday.\" \"I have my doubts as to how significantly we can rally the base, rally the American people when Joe is a candidate who has received funding from over 60 billionaires, has a super PAC, is now, I guess receiving support from Mike Bloomberg,\" Sanders said. \"Do they really think that that is the kind of reality that's going to energize the American people?\" PRESIDENT TRUMP The Trump campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN on Friday, claiming that they published \"false and defamatory statements,\" reports\u00a0CBS News political broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0The lawsuit targets a June 2019 opinion piece about the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, specifically the phrase in that piece that claimed the campaign \"assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.\"\u00a0 \"The statements were and are 100 percent false and defamatory,\" Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser to Trump, said in a statement. \"The campaign was motivated by the fact that the publications recklessly published false statements which caused harm and intentionally mislead their readers.\u00a0 The campaign said they sent a written demand to CNN on February 25 to retract and apologize for the article, to which the complaint says CNN refused. CNN joins The New York Times and the Washington Post in being sued over opinion articles about Russia.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE \u00a0Biden picked up endorsements from three more House Democrats in competitive districts, California's Harley Rouda and Michigan's Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin. This brings Biden's total count of these \"Frontline\" endorsements to 13, reports\u00a0CBS News political broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Both Rouda and Stevens previously endorsed Mike Bloomberg, who spent millions in helping House Democrats get elected in 2018. Remaining holdovers from Bloomberg's list who haven't officially announced their next endorsement are Lucy McBath of Georgia, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Max Rose of New York and Ben McAdams of Utah.\u00a0In her statement, Slotkin took similar slights that moderates have done against Sanders' policies. \"I hear from my constituents every day that they want an end to the all-or-nothing politics that have so polarized our country. All-or-nothing doesn't get us lower drug costs or more affordable healthcare,\" she said. \"In Michigan, we have a rich tradition of hard work, decency, and passionate pragmatism.\" Sanders, who has endorsements from eight House members in safely Democratic districts, will be hold a rally on Saturday in Dearborn, Michigan, just south of Slotkin's district.   In Minnesota, longtime Democratic Congressman Collin Peterson is expected to announce his run for reelection, as first reported by\u00a0Politico. Peterson, one of two Democrats in Congress to vote against both articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, has been in Congress since 1990. The district has become more conservative and although Peterson's last two elections were within 5 points, Mr. Trump won it by over 30 points in 2016.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who skyrocketed to the top of the field early in the\u00a0Democratic nomination race, has dropped his presidential bid. Buttigieg won the most delegates in the\u00a0Iowa caucuses\u00a0and finished second in the\u00a0New Hampshire primary, but struggled to come up with a path forward after coming in third in Nevada and fourth in South Carolina. \u00a0 \"After a year of going everywhere, meeting everyone, defying every expectation, seeking every vote \u2014 the truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy, if not for our cause,\" Buttigieg told supporters Sunday night in South Bend.\u00a0 Buttigieg said he would do \"everything in my power\" to make sure a Democrat wins the 2020 general election. He noted his campaign's emphasis on \"broad and inclusive politics\" and said he still believes that is the \"way forward for our eventual nominee.\" He encouraged supporters to join together for the cause and emphasized the importance of supporting a nominee who would help win down-ballot races. Pete Buttigieg: \u201cTonight I am making the\u00a0difficult decision to suspend\u00a0my campaign for the presidency.\u00a0I will no longer seek to be the\u00a02020 Democratic nominee for president.\u201d https://t.co/qhpffOU5gb pic.twitter.com/u7FJwqgRQ9 It was unclear Sunday night whether Buttigieg planned to endorse any of his rivals, but Joe Biden was considered the likely choice. A Biden aide said the two had yet to connect, given that both were crossing the country on Sunday, but they had traded voicemails.\u00a0 Buttigieg was scheduled to attend a town hall Sunday evening in Dallas but announced his flight from Selma, Alabama, was being diverted to South Bend, where he planned to make an announcement. Buttigieg had just finished marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to commemorate the 55th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. President Trump tweeted about Buttigieg's withdrawal: Pete Buttigieg is OUT. All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play - NO NOMINATION, AGAIN! Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the race, staked his candidacy on generational change, offering voters a vision for ushering in a new generation of political leadership. He pitched himself as a Washington outsider, often telling voters his campaign was about getting \"Washington to run a little more like our best run cities and towns than the other way around.\" He also offered voters a moderate alternative to Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which he showcased with policies on health care \u2014 \"Medicare for all who want it\" \u2014 and college affordability, rather than free college. Buttigieg proposed allowing Americans to opt into a government health care plan, but also letting citizens to retain their private health insurance if they preferred that option. In contrast, Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan calls for a government-run health care system that would eliminate private health insurance. As the nominating contests were underway, Buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with Sanders on policy and tone. He often told crowds at campaign stops that Sanders offers voters a choice between a \"revolution\" or the \"status quo\" that could risk alienating voters needed to build the coalition to beat Mr. Trump. \"We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,\" Buttigieg said on the night of the Nevada caucuses. \"We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement.\" Buttigieg frequently said his campaign was about building a sense of belonging and a coalition of Democrats, Republicans and \"future former Republicans.\" A few days after the New Hampshire primary, Buttigieg reflected on the historic nature of his run. \"My belief in American belonging is reflected in my experience before you right now, as somebody who is not that removed from the memory of being a teenager in Indiana, wondering if he would ever fit in this world, wondering if something about him meant that he would always be on the outside, would never serve in uniform or in office, would never be accepted, would never even know love,\" Buttigieg said at a Democratic Party dinner on Valentine's Day in California. \"And that very same person is standing in front of you leading right now in the delegate race for the nomination for the presidency.\" The former South Bend mayor had strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, states with predominantly white populations, but his message failed to resonate with the majority of minority voters. Buttigieg argued on the campaign trail that performing well in Iowa and New Hampshire would demonstrate his ability to win. And with the strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, he argued that minority voters would give his candidacy a second look.\u00a0 However, his theory of the race didn't play out. He received just 2% support from black voters and 12% from Hispanic voters in Nevada, according to CBS News entrance polling data. Similarly, in South Carolina, where approximately 60% of the Democratic primary electorate are African American voters, Buttigieg received 3% support from black voters, according to CBS News exit polling data. Buttigieg and his campaign suffered some missteps in their outreach to the African-American community during the election cycle, including the use of a stock photo of a Kenyan woman on a page of his campaign website when he released his plan to end systemic racism in the U.S. And his record as South Bend mayor and his complex relationship with law enforcement came under intense scrutiny after a white police officer fatally shot Eric Logan, a black South Bend resident, in June 2019. Although he struggled with minority voters, the millennial military veteran nonetheless impressed a number of voters with his call for generational change and his quick intellect. In the second quarter of 2019, Buttigieg prioritized fundraising and posted the top haul for the quarter, displaying his fundraising prowess among high-dollar donors and grassroots donors. Buttigieg's campaign heavily invested in Iowa and New Hampshire by expanding its ground operation in the first two nominating contests. The campaign focused on relational organizing, which emphasized building out personal networks, rather than traditional organizing strategies. And Buttigieg's campaign offered substantial access to the candidate with three bus tours with press members, two in Iowa and one in New Hampshire. But his team was slower to grow its operation in Nevada and South Carolina, states with more diverse, dispersed electorates. After meeting with former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter Sunday morning in Plains, Georgia, Buttigieg told reporters he wanted to make sure his run for president is \"useful\" and was heading in the \"right direction.\" \"Every day, we get up, we assess where we are and we look at how we can be making the biggest contribution to the future and every day that we've been running this campaign has been based on our belief that our campaign's message is the right one,\" Buttigieg said Sunday morning.

            "article_content": "Candidates who planned to spend the spring connecting with voters face-to-face have seen their campaigns thwarted by the coronavirus. As a result, Democrats have been compensating with more time on the airwaves, spending largely on ads related to health care. Democratic Senate campaigns and outside groups have been racking up big ad buys to highlight flaws in the healthcare system and slam Republicans over access to coverage.\u00a0 Since the week of March 13, the day President Trump\u00a0declared a national emergency, Democrats have spent about $82 million mostly on health-focused ad buys scheduled through the fall, according to CMAG/Kantar Media data.\u00a0 Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic Super PAC focused on flipping control of the Senate, has placed more than $70 million in ad reservations in key battleground states.\u00a0 \"Health care has been a top issue and remains a top issue, if not one of the most important issues to voters,\" Senate Majority PAC communications director Rachel Irwin told CBS News. \u00a0 The failure of Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017 handed Democrats an opportunity to showcase their efforts to preserve the nation's health care law. In the 2018 midterms, nearly three out of every five pro-Democratic ads mentioned health,\u00a0according to a study\u00a0by the Wesleyan Media Project. The same has been true this season: exit polling in the early Democratic primaries found health care remained among the top issues on voters' minds as they headed to the polls.\u00a0 And concerns about COVID-19 have reminded voters of health care issues that Democrats have championed, like coverage of preexisting conditions, a popular component of the Affordable Care Act. And Medicaid expansion, mostly opposed by Republicans but advocated by Democrats, has also been a big part of the national and political conversation about health care. Under the Affordable Care Act, governors in most states have opted to expand the program, which provides affordable care to low-income earners. \u00a0 A\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation study\u00a0found that around 2.3 million low-income adults in the 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid would benefit if their states decided to expand the program. Some of those states such as North Carolina, Georgia, and Kansas have crucial Senate races this fall.\u00a0 Among the Democratic Senate candidates who have seized on health care in their races against Republican opponents is Pastor Raphael Warnock of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. His campaign highlights\u00a0his arrest in 2014\u00a0for protesting the state's decision not to expand Medicaid. In Montana, the Super PAC Protect Our Care has commissioned an ad highlighting GOP Senator Steve Daines' 2017\u00a0vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The ad begins, \"Healthcare is a top concern of Montana families \u2014 the cost of care and whether the care will be there when they need it.\" And it ends by asking Montanans to call Daines about their healthcare concerns. Daines is up for reelection in November, and former Montana Governor and presidential candidate Steve Bullock will be challenging him in November. Now that former Vice President Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee, Democrats can focus on health care without drawing Republican attacks on the costs of \"Medicare for All,\" the single-payer health care plan introduced by Bernie Sanders, who dropped his bid and this week endorsed Biden. During the Democratic primary debates, Biden said he wants to build on the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option that includes some automatic enrollment. He also recently called for\u00a0lowering the eligibility age\u00a0for Medicare.\u00a0 During the pandemic Biden and other Democrats have called on the federal government to reopen Affordable Care Act health care exchanges to allow more people to sign up for coverage. As far as the national exchanges are concerned, President Trump has rejected this idea, saying instead that the government would cover the cost for those treated for COVID-19 who are uninsured. At the same time, nearly a dozen states have reopened their state-based exchanges to allow the uninsured to get coverage amid the pandemic.\u00a0 While Democrats rally around the issue, Republicans lack their own health care plan to gather behind. Last year, President Trump claimed Republicans would unveil their own health care plan, but they have yet to present one as they head into the general election season.\u00a0 \"Democrat candidates are relying on false attacks from the same dark money entities they hypocritically bemoan on the campaign trail,\" National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee communications director Jesse Hunt told CBS News in a statement. \"Voters know if Democrats get their way private health insurance will no longer exist, so these groups are doing what they can to paper over their candidates' vulnerabilities.\"\u00a0 Republican Senate campaigns have also ramped up ad spending, but the bulk of their ads focus on the economic recovery plan the Senate passed in March with bipartisan support. Senators including Mitch McConnell, Steve Daines and Susan Collins have all aired ads highlighting the federal coronavirus response. McConnell is running an ad that mentions unspecified attacks by his opponent, Amy McGrath, and claims that while she attacks him, he's leading, \"working across the aisle to get hundreds of millions in federal dollars for Kentucky hospitals\" during the crisis, and \"helping small businesses get emergency loans.\" CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders ended his campaign for president on Wednesday, clearing the way for former Vice President Joe Biden to capture the Democratic nomination and challenge President Trump in November. The Vermont senator announced his decision to campaign staff before delivering remarks on a livestream. \"I wish I could give you better news, but I think you know the truth,\" Sanders told supporters, adding that \"the path towards victory is virtually impossible.\" \"I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will be unsuccessful,\" Sanders continued, calling it a \"difficult and painful decision.\" Sanders alluded to the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, saying that continuing his campaign would \"interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour.\" Sanders said the virus \"has exposed for all to see how absurd our current employer-based health insurance system is.\" However, Sanders emphasized that he would not stop fighting for political change. \"While this campaign is coming to an end, our movement is not,\" Sanders said. He congratulated Biden, calling him a \"decent man,\" and conceded he will win the nomination, but declined to endorse him outright. Instead, Sanders said he will remain on the ballot in states that have yet to hold primaries, hoping to rack up more delegates so that his supporters, and his policies, will be able to influence the party platform at the Democratic convention. Sanders thanked his supporters for making a \"profound impact in changing our nation.\" \"Together we have transformed the American consciousness as to what kind of nation we can become,\" Sanders said. He argued that ideas such as Medicare for All and raising the minimum wage had gained traction in mainstream Democratic politics, proving \"our movement has won the ideological struggle.\" Sanders adopted a sad but positive tone as he informed his staff about his decision before his remarks, according to an aide on the call. \"The struggle goes on. This was never about Bernie Sanders, this was always about the movement,\" the aide said. In a statement following his announcement, Biden praised Sanders, saying he and his supporters \"have changed the dialogue in America.\" \"Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn't just run a political campaign; he's created a movement,\" Biden said. \"And make no mistake about it, I believe it's a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That's a good thing for our nation and our future.\" Biden said Sanders \"doesn't get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we've done enough,\" and made a direct appeal to Sanders' supporters. \"I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You're needed,\" the former vice president said. \"Together we will defeat Donald Trump.\" Sanders spoke around midday today about the senator's decision to suspend his campaign, a source familiar with the call tells CBS News. This was one of several calls between the two opponents in recent weeks to discuss the future of their campaigns. Former President Barack Obama has also been in touch with Sanders a few times in recent weeks as the senator mulled his campaign's future, according to a person familiar with those calls who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about them. Obama has kept close tabs on the campaign, and has spoken with most of the Democratic presidential contenders in recent months, usually right after they decided to end their respective bids. Sanders had a strong finish in early primaries, becoming the front-runner after winning in New Hampshire and Nevada, but faltered in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday primaries, as Biden drew upon strong African-American support to sweep the South. Many of his former opponents have endorsed Biden, who is now the only candidate remaining in the race. Sanders was a fundraising juggernaut throughout the campaign, raising over $46 million in February alone. More than 2 million people contributed to Sanders' campaign, with an average contribution of $18. Sanders promised a wave of new voters would turn out for his candidacy, but it never materialized. After a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday in early March, he admitted that young voters, essential to his political revolution, had yet to show up in the numbers he was hoping to see. \"If you might want to ask me, maybe as a follow-up question, 'have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?' And the answer is no.\" As in his previous failed primary bid in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, Sanders's support for Medicare for All was a key issue throughout the campaign. Although Elizabeth Warren embraced the idea of Medicare for All, other candidates, including Biden, balked at the estimated $30 trillion price tag. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in February after his Nevada win, Sanders said the idea of a \"political revolution\" was popular among voters tired of the status quo. \"The ideas that seemed radical four years ago are now kind of mainstream,\" Sanders said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Sanders as \"crazy,\" urged his supporters to join the Republican Party in a tweet Wednesday. He blamed Warren for pulling votes away from Sanders. \"Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!\" Mr. Trump wrote.

            "article_content": "On February 29,\u00a0South Carolina Democrats\u00a0and voters nationwide will have their first opportunity to see how candidates perform in a state whose Democratic electorate is expected to be mostly African-American. Sixty percent of the turnout here is expected to comprise black voters. Two months into 2020, after three states have weighed in, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, Bernie Sanders has emerged as the front-runner, winning both Nevada and New Hampshire, and garnering the greatest number of votes in Iowa (though he came in slightly behind Pete Buttigieg in delegates). The\u00a0Nevada caucuses\u00a0were the first test of candidate's appeal to minority voters, given its substantial Hispanic population. Sanders was the most popular candidate among Hispanic voters, CBS News entrance polls showed. In South Carolina, up to this point,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says Joe Biden has been leading, though his margins have been shrinking. A\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0released Sunday shows Biden ahead of Sanders by just 5 points, a dramatic drop from the double-digit lead he held before the voting in other states began. The candidates will also have one more opportunity to debate each other before the primary Saturday and Super Tuesday. The\u00a0debate on Tuesday in Charleston will be co-hosted by CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. In this special\u00a0DEBATE\u00a0edition of\u00a0Trail Markers, the\u00a0CBS News Political Unit\u00a0gives a preview of what to expect from each of the candidates in Tuesday night's contest. JOE BIDEN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON\u00a0In Nevada, Joe Biden zeroed in on two issues: healthcare and guns. On the campaign trail, Biden often questions Bernie Sanders for not being able to nail down the cost of his \"Medicare for All\" healthcare plan. Biden's campaign expected this to would be a major point of contention for union families in Nevada, since single-payer plans would outlaw the generous private union plans. But CBS News exit polls indicated that in Nevada, 6 in 10 respondents in union households support the idea of \"Medicare for All.\" In light of that, it's worth watching whether or how Biden retools his swipes at Sanders on this issue. Biden's message on \"defeating the NRA\" seemed to attract both attention and praise in Nevada. And Charleston, the site of this week's debate, shares an tragic connection to Las Vegas: they both have experienced high-profile mass shootings. CBS News has been told to expect to hear Biden speak directly about how he would try to prevent shootings like the one that took place at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015. Biden has been pointing out that Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill five times, and his campaign released a jarring\u00a0video\u00a0targeted at Sanders' past openness after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012 to shielding gun manufacturers from lawsuits after these mass casualty incidents. In an\u00a0interview with Face the Nation's Margaret Brennan this weekend, Biden downplayed what his own campaign team has been saying, that South Carolina is his \"firewall.\" He said he plans to do well here and through Super Tuesday next week. But he admitted that billionaires in the race \u2014 Tom Steyer, in particular \u2014 have cut into his support with black voters in the state. A\u00a0CBS News South Carolina poll\u00a0published Sunday showed that Steyer has 18% support in the state, while Biden's lead here has narrowed. He has attracted 28% support, and Sanders now has 23%. In South Carolina, Biden made this point about Steyer: \"I'm not saying Tom Steyer's a bad guy, but Tom Steyer was one of the largest investors in private prisons in the United States of America,\u00a0 while I was trying to get rid of private prisons, and Barack was trying to get rid of private prisons.\" A potential boost for Biden is the expected endorsement this by House Majority Whip James Clyburn on Wednesday, who is the longest-serving member of the Palmetto State's congressional delegation and the most senior African-American lawmaker on Capitol Hill,\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER TIM PERRY\u00a0Mike Bloomberg has barely been seen since his disappointing debate debut performance last week in Las Vegas. He conceded in an interview with MSNBC that it wasn't his best night, but he says he knows he can do better.\u00a0 \"I didn't have a chance to really say what I wanted to say.\" Bloomberg said. \"Will it be the first time I've had a bad night? No. Will it be the last? No. If you had a debate on a stage having never had a bad night, nobody would be on the stage.\"\u00a0 There's an array of issues Bloomberg has may be asked to address going into Tuesday night's debate, including a tepid apology for stop-and-frisk. And since he was confronted by Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden on stage about nondisclosure agreements signed by women who alleged sexual harassment at Bloomberg L.P., Bloomberg announced he would release three women from NDAs, since these were cases that involved complaints about comments Bloomberg himself had made. He also said the company will no longer require women use confidentiality agreements in settling sexual harassment or misconduct allegations going forward. But it's already evident this will not satisfy some of his opponents, and the questions could come up again Tuesday night.\u00a0 His campaign has said nothing about his preparations going into this debate, but a campaign aide told CBS News to expect Bloomberg to be on the offensive against Bernie Sanders. Bloomberg had originally planned to participate in his first CNN town hall Monday before the debate, but postponed those plans in order to continue preparing for the upcoming debate.\u00a0 \"The country can't afford to let Bernie Sanders skate by another debate without a focus on his extreme record.\" Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen said. \"Mike is preparing for Tuesday's crucial debate, and looks forward to taking part in CNN's town hall on Wednesday.\" Watch for Bloomberg to go after Sanders, the front-runner after strong showings in the first three contests, for his past positions on gun control and for rhetoric coming from the Sanders campaign that Bloomberg officials say led to vandalism incidents against Bloomberg campaign offices across the country. PETE BUTTIGIEG VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN\u00a0Pete Buttigieg used his speech after the Nevada caucuses to take aim at Sanders, referring broadly to Sanders' movement as an \"inflexible ideological revolution\" that excludes Americans. \"We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,\" Buttigieg said. \"We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement.\"\u00a0 In South Carolina, Buttigieg recently launched an ad that explicitly names Sanders when comparing health care proposals. And in the days leading up to the South Carolina debate and with Super Tuesday approaching, Buttigieg has been sounding alarms that Sanders may have an \"insurmountable delegate lead\" soon.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTERS MUSADIQ BIDAR & BO ERICKSON\u00a0 After Amy Klobuchar's campaign got shot of adrenaline with her surprising third-place finish in New Hampshire, she was not able to fully convert that momentum into success in Nevada. The Minnesota senator is now in sixth place in Nevada, perhaps indicating her campaign may have troubles ahead in South Carolina In a memo to reporters today, Klobuchar's campaign announced $4.2 million in ad buys in Super Tuesday states on cable, broadcast and digital. Ahead of the debate in South Carolina, the campaign says it's making another \"six-figure investment on South Carolina TV,\" with just days until the First in the South Primary.\u00a0 And in an effort to keep introducing herself to voters in other states, Klobuchar on Sunday made trips to North Dakota, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The latter two are Super Tuesday states. In the last debate, Klobuchar quarreled with Buttigieg, but in the South Carolina debate, she may go after Sanders. Campaign manager Justin Buoen said in the memo that \"she is the best person to take on Bernie Sanders and the best candidate to beat Donald Trump.\" BERNIE SANDERS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE\u00a0When pundits and opponents claimed Bernie Sanders underperformed this year in New Hampshire, compared to his substantial double-digit victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016, his campaign pointed out that in a much larger field, of course his margin of victory would be smaller. But South Carolina is different. In 2016, Bernie Sanders did not win a single county in the state. Clinton secured nearly three times the vote as did Sanders. That walloping was part of the reason why Sanders developed the reputation for being popular only with young white men.\u00a0\u00a0With this in mind, his campaign has set the bar very low for him in South Carolina. If he finishes high, Sanders will spin it as a win, and given his dismal showing in 2016, it would be an accomplishment. An outright win would almost certainly cement his dominance in the field.\u00a0The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll showed that Biden's lead has been narrowing, with Sanders just five points behind him. The Sanders campaign has hustled in South Carolina since he announced his candidacy one year ago. Campaign co-chair state Senator Nina Turner, arguably Sanders' most impassioned and popular surrogates, visited South Carolina at least once a week this cycle. Other surrogates have been crisscrossing the state, including actor Danny Glover, Rapper Killer Mike, activist Phillip Agnew, and Dr. Cornell West \u2013 all commanding figures who also happen to be African-American.\u00a0Sanders has also made it a point to campaign in the poor, rural parts of the state, known as the \"corridor of shame,\" where the education system is poor and inequality is high. He unveiled his Thurgood Marshall plan on bolstering public education here last summer. He took private tours of homes in Denmark, South Carolina, where water is so polluted that black homeowners can't drink from their faucets.\u00a0It's concerted efforts like these that Sanders' campaign hopes will help remake his image for South Carolinians. If Sanders can tell these stories at the debate Tuesday, it could help him, but whether he'll have the ability to do that when his opponents on stage are intent on taking him down is an open question. Sanders faced some opposition in the last debate \u2014 but not as much as Bloomberg faced. Given the expectation that wins for him in the Super Tuesday races will give him an insurmountable lead, Sanders can be expected to face challenges from every corner. TOM STEYER VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK\u00a0Tom Steyer's campaign has been arguing that he will show his strength in the more diverse early states, but he also bet big on Nevada, spending 26 days in the state and $15.5 million for ads, according to Kantar Media data, and he failed to place first or second, as he hoped (h/t campaign reporter Alex Tin). In the South Carolina debate Tuesday, Steyer plans to make a case against the \"socialist\" economic policies of Bernie Sanders, according to a campaign aide.\u00a0 Steyer was third in the CBS News poll, after Biden and Sanders. He has already said President Trump is \"running on the idea that Democrats can't grow an economy [and] are a bunch of socialists.\" He has also criticized Biden and Buttigieg for their respective insider and newcomer status.\u00a0 Steyer has put combating climate change at the forefront of his platform, and he is likely to tout his work with the super PAC he created in 2013, NextGen America, in coastal Charleston. He also frequently reminds voters in South Carolina that he is the only candidate who has explicitly said he supports reparations for the descendants of slaves.\u00a0 \"Tom is the only candidate in the race fighting to return power to communities left behind by Washington through specific policies, including reparations, direct democracy, and term limits for Members of Congress,\" campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. \"On the debate stage Tuesday night, Tom will demonstrate that he is the only candidate who can expose Trump on the economy, put together a diverse coalition that can win in November, and break the corporate stranglehold over our government.\"\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK\u00a0Elizabeth Warren's strong performance in the Las Vegas debate may have come too late to give her a boost in Nevada, after so many early votes had been cast. But South Carolina does not have early voting, and its debate gives Warren a final chance to build momentum going into the primary here and Super Tuesday. She is already foreshadowing another night of biting criticism and sharp contrasts, especially with Mike Bloomberg. She spent much of 2019 avoiding conflict with fellow Democratic candidates, and the billionaire was the first one she openly attacked. She made him a foil for her campaign, which is centered on removing money's influence from politics.\u00a0 \"I think that Michael Bloomberg is the riskiest candidate standing on that stage,\" Warren told reporters in Denver Sunday. \"Because of his history of hiding his taxes, his history of harassment of women, and his history of defending racist policies.\" But Warren, who took at least one jab at every other candidate on the stage in Nevada, has also shown a new readiness to take a swing at her longtime Senate ally Bernie Sanders. \"I get real stuff done. I have rock solid and I get stuff done,\" she said on MSNBC Friday, asked how she's different from Sanders. \"I don't want to be a president just to yell at people. I want to be a president to change things.\"\u00a0 Bolstered by her performance last debate, Warren's campaign appears to have the funds to stay in the race through South Carolina and Super Tuesday. But without a top finish in the first three states, she will need to distinguish herself again in this debate and Saturday's primary to climb back into the top tier. STATE-BY-STATE TEXAS A new poll from the University of Houston Hobby School of Public Affairs shows Biden and Sanders effectively tied for the lead in Texas. Biden had support from 22.5% of likely Texas Democratic primary voters, while Sanders had 22.1%. Trailing them were Warren (18.3%), Bloomberg (13.4%), Buttigieg (11.9%) and Klobuchar (7.2%). \u00a0 The poll was conducted from February 6-18 and has a margin of error of +/- 2.7%. That means some people were surveyed before Warren and Biden finished fourth and fifth respectively in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. The poll also found that voters care most about finding a candidate to beat President Trump (57.1%), compared to someone with whom they agree on issues (31.8%) or who has the most experience (11.1%). Sanders led the field with the highest support among Latino voters (30.3%) and Biden had the highest support with African Americans (45.8%). In Texas, Bloomberg has spent about $40 million on television and radio advertising, according to Kantar/CMAG. Most likely primary voters (83.8%) said that they've seen a Bloomberg ad, according to the poll. For those who have seen an ad, 52.5% say they have a more favorable impression of Bloomberg, compared to 12.3% who see him less favorably and 35.3% whose opinions were unchanged.\u00a0 The poll was released after Sanders spent the weekend campaigning in Texas. Thousands of people attended his rallies in El Paso, San Antonio, Houston and Austin, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, where Sanders repeatedly assured his supporters that he would be victorious in Texas' Super Tuesday primary. \"On television they say you know Texas is a conservative state, it's a red state. I don't believe it for a minute,\" Sanders said in Houston on Sunday. \"If our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in Texas.\" During his Houston rally, Sanders celebrated his win in Nevada and cited recent polling, including from\u00a0CBS News, that shows him leading Mr. Trump nationally and in some battleground states. He also took aim at Bloomberg, saying that people are \"tired of billionaires buying elections.\" He added, \"Now, Michael Bloomberg, like anyone else in America has the right to run for president, but he does not have the right to buy the presidency.\"\u00a0 In Austin on Sunday evening, the final stop on his swing, a fired up Sanders declared that the \"the establishment is getting a little bit nervous about our campaign.\" But throughout the weekend, Sanders assured supporters that the message of \"we're in it together\" is a central theme of his campaign. \"We must create a government and a nation in which we understand that the problems of your family are my family's problems,\" Sanders said in Austin. \"And my family's problems are your family's problems.\"",

            "article_content": "Des Moines, Iowa \u2014 Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar believes Iowa voters should choose her over former Vice President Joe Biden not only because she represents a new generation, but also because she has learned to work with a Republican Party reshaped by President Trump. \"Of course he has vast experience, and our country has benefited because of that,\" Klobuchar said of Biden Sunday evening in an interview with CBS News. \"But I have had the experience of governing in the last few years with Donald Trump, and I've seen what's motivating my Republican colleagues firsthand \u2014 the bad of it \u2014 but I've also figured out ways you can get through.\" She noted the president has signed more than 30 bills into law where she was the lead Democratic sponsor. The latest\u00a0CBS News battleground tracker\u00a0has Klobuchar with 7% support among likely Democratic voters in Iowa. She trails Biden, with 25% support, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with 22% support, in the hunt for Iowa's more moderate Democrats. Like all of the lower-performing candidates in the race, she stands to benefit from the fact that just 35% of likely voters say they've definitely made up their mind about who they will support. But if she remains stuck in single digits, Klobuchar is in trouble: candidates can only walk away from Iowa with all-important delegates if they win at least 15% support. Her criticism isn't just reserved for her fellow moderates. Klobuchar also said she had \"a big issue\" with the fact that her fellow senator, Vermont's Bernie Sanders,\u00a0told\u00a0\"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell last Friday that it was \"impossible to predict\" how much his Medicare-for-All plan would cost. \"Do you know exactly what health care costs will be, one minute, in the next 10 years if we do nothing? It will be a lot more expensive than a Medicare-for-all single-payer system,\" Sanders said. Klobuchar said that sounds far too much like President Trump's promises. \"That is the difference between a plan and a pipe dream,\" she said. \"We already have someone that's running up the debt in the White House and Donald Trump has been treating people like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. I think it is really important that we have a candidate leading the ticket who is going to be able to take on Donald Trump on that very issue.\" \"He says all this stuff. And then he refused to pay for it, or he adds it to the debt or burdens the shoulders of kids,\" she added. \"I don't think that's the way to do it, and I think you have to be really straightforward. You just can't say I'll figure that out later. You have to show how you're going to pay for things, and I've done that.\" Sanders, Klobuchar and two other senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennett of Colorado, have all been pulled away from the campaign trail in the final two weeks of the Iowa caucus by president's impeachment trial, which demands their participation six days a week. And while Klobuchar has been holding tele-town halls and dispatching surrogates across the state, she's the one who likely suffers the most from the time way from the state. So, in the limited time she had during the trial, she spent her 36 hours campaigning in Iowa this weekend to appeal to her supporters for help on the ground. \"I've always believed the obstacles on the path aren't obstacles. They are the path. I am good at those events. I like talking to people. I like making my case,\" she said. \"We are getting bigger and bigger crowds and still having people come and say, 'I hadn't heard you before. I've heard 10 candidates, and I'm going to support you.' That happened in Waterloo. And so, I know what I'm missing out on, because for me this is a unique part of my campaigning that kind of was crescendoing to the end.\" \"But it is my job. I've got to go do my job, and I'm one of 100 jurors,\" she said. \"I'm certainly not going to shirk my duties at this constitutional crisis moment for country.\" Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "With under two weeks to go before Election Day, Joe Biden is bombarding the airwaves and digital spaces with advertisements and outspending President Trump by tens of millions.\u00a0 And that trend seems likely to continue, as Federal Election Commission reports show the Trump campaign had only $63 million going into October, while the Biden campaign had nearly three times as much \u2014 $177 million. The Democratic presidential nominee has been outpacing Mr. Trump on ad spending since July and has already spent more than $515 million on advertisements for the general election \u2014 that's over $100 million more than Mr. Trump, who has spent about $409 million, according to tracking by Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group. It's an unprecedented investment in advertising by a presidential candidate and comes in an election year that has already seen historic early voting, with more than 39.9 million people having already cast their ballots, according to the U.S. Elections Project. And based on states that report party affiliations, the majority of those ballots have been cast by Democrats. With 14 days to go, Biden has already outspent what Hillary Clinton spent on TV and radio ads across the entire general election from mid-June through Election Day in 2016. Spending more isn't always a harbinger of victory \u2014 the former secretary of state's campaign put around $270 million into the race four years ago, while then-candidate Trump spent less than $100 million. Biden's campaign has already placed nearly $400 million in TV and radio ads alone according to Kantar/CMAG. Eight years ago, President Obama spent an estimated $314 million on local, national and national cable TV ads for his 2012 reelection bid. Republican nominee Mitt Romney spent about $129.5 million on local, national and cable TV in that election. Biden has spent $290 million on the same type of advertising plus another $85 million on local cable and satellite TV. Biden's dominance on the airwaves is the result of his surge in fundraising as the Democratic nominee. The former vice president, DNC and their joint fundraising committee have raised a staggering $1.1 billion in less than six months. In an October 17 campaign memo obtained by CBS News, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon noted that Biden for President has \"made the largest investment in paid advertising in the history of presidential campaigns.\" It's allowed them to \"blanket key battleground states\" and \"communicate directly with key demographics.\" Over the course of the general election, Biden is currently projected to spend more than $553 million on ads according to Kantar/CMAG. President Trump is currently projected to drop $439 million on ads through November 3.\u00a0 Usually, presidential campaigns at this point are pulling ads and resources from some states and increasing spending in other states, dropping clues about their vulnerabilities. Biden's prolific fundraising suggests that his campaign doesn't have to make those choices. Mr. Trump's campaign, which has raised far more than it did in 2016 and is still spending on TV, says it's also concentrating on voter mobilization efforts. In a call with reporters Monday, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien announced the campaign and RNC will be spending a combined $55 million in paid advertising in the final two weeks of the race. They claim it's an approximately 40% increase over their initial plans. \u00a0 The campaign also defended its financial investments, noting Mr. Trump was also heavily outspent in 2016. There are outside groups spending, too, and they're taking a multi-pronged approach.\u00a0 \"This is really a tale of two campaigns. Joe Biden is putting it all on TV. That's his choice, that's his strategy,\" said Stepien. \"We also have TV ads. We have lots of TV ads in the president's favor. But in addition to that, we're actually running a real campaign, a national campaign \u2014 you know, a campaign with voter contacts, a campaign with events, a campaign with surrogates, a campaign with voter registration drives. We like our plan better.\"\u00a0 The vast majority of ad spending by both campaigns has been centered on a handful of battleground states. For the Biden campaign, most of its investments have been focused predominantly in 16 states. Mr. Trump's campaign has zeroed in on about 11 states in recent weeks. The state seeing the most television and radio ad spending by the Biden and Trump campaigns is Florida. Biden has spent $91 million already in the Sunshine State, while Mr. Trump has spent more than $60.5 million to date. Biden is also investing heavily in Pennsylvania, with more than $53 million to date, as recent polls show him with an edge. Mr. Trump, who barely won the state in 2016, has spent less than half of that, with just over $24 million on TV and radio according to Kantar/CMAG.\u00a0 Mr. Trump is also being dramatically outspent in Wisconsin and Michigan, two states he narrowly won in 2016 and where recent polls show Biden slightly ahead. In Michigan, the president is being outspent more than two to one with just over $13 million compared to Biden's $33.6 million. In Wisconsin, that ratio is over three to one on television and radio ads, with Biden having spent more than $27 million so far, compared to the president's $7.5 million. As the presidential race in North Carolina shapes up to be one of the tightest in the country, with 15 electoral votes up for grabs, both candidates are spending heavily. Biden has already dropped more than $39.5 million on TV and radio while Mr. Trump has invested more than $28 million in the state. And in Arizona, Biden has spent more than $35 million, compared to the president's $20.7 million so far. One major 2020 battleground where the president has outspent Biden so far is in Georgia, where Mr. Trump has invested $15.6 million to date, compared to the former vice president's $4.4 million. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the state with a 5.1% margin of victory. Over the past few weeks, both campaigns have been focusing on the coronavirus, the economy and health care. The latest Biden ads over the past week tend to reflect the messaging O'Malley Dillon laid out in her memo, including the need to get the coronavirus under control, rebuild the economy, and \"unite our country after four years of division.\" \"We've got this virus now out of control, people out of work, no health care,\" says a salon co-owner named Maggie in one ad first aired on TV this week. \"We're struggling because Trump didn't do his job,\" claims Sarah who works in the service industry in another. These are two of multiple ads hitting TV over the past week that feature Americans airing frustrations over the handling of the coronavirus and backing Biden.\u00a0 Other ads focus on the unemployment numbers in battleground states and tout Biden's economic plans. In a 30-second spot first aired Tuesday, Biden lays out his vision to get to universal health care \"quickly,\" arguing \"Americans desperately need it.\"\u00a0 At the same time, there are a number of ads targeting people of color and urging Americans to vote. One features the sister of George Floyd. Another includes Black mayors from across the U.S., while a series also shows a group of young Black men talking about the importance of voting. \"Everybody says your voice is your vote, so if you don't vote, you are comfortable being silenced,\" a man named George says in one ad.\u00a0 And in keeping with their message of unity, on Tuesday, during game 1 of the World Series, Biden aired a one-minute ad in which the narrator says that \"there is only one America.\" It ends with \"Joe Biden doesn't need everyone in this country to always agree \u2014 just to agree we all love this country and go from there.\"\u00a0 While Biden's campaign features his remarks in TV ads, the Trump campaign appears to focus more on the imagery of the president than his words on the campaign trail. The president has also released far fewer new ads on TV in the past week. There's one new ad on the coronavirus response, as well as spots slamming Biden over taxes, the Second Amendment and Medicare. In the new coronavirus ad, the video shows the rare instance of the president wearing a mask in public.\u00a0 \"President Trump is leading,\" the narrator claims, after accusing Biden of not having a COVID response plan. It concludes, \"Under President Trump we will be careful but resolute, and we will defeat this virus.\" The Trump campaign also touted plans for RNC-created TV ads messaging seniors in Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin in the final weeks. According to the RNC, roughly $14 million of its ad blitz over the next two weeks will be spent on ads about President Trump protecting Medicare.\u00a0 These spots started airing on television Tuesday, highlighting health care premium costs in battleground states. In the ads, the announcer falsely warns private insurance would be \"eliminated\" under the Biden-Harris plan. \"Protect your Medicare coverage, vote for President Trump,\" he says. Another ad features selected videos of the former vice president talking about raising taxes, but does not include the quotes where Biden says he's talking about the wealthiest Americans.\u00a0 The campaign has also unveiled ads aimed at Hunter Biden, but it doesn't appear that the two ads have aired on TV to date.\u00a0 Nicole Sganga and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "In an ad that first aired Tuesday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, flames light up the TV screen, ominous music plays, and a narrator states, \"While America's cities burned, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fanned the flames.\" The 30-second spot is part of President Trump's final messaging push before Election Day that Mr. Trump will keep Americans safe.\u00a0 \u00a0The ad differs from the TV spots first aired this week by the Biden campaign. \"I believe it's time to unite the country, to come together as a nation,\" Joe Biden says in a direct-to-camera appeal, reprising common lines from his campaign trail stump speech. In the video testimonial, images of people hugging, holding hands and voting flash across the screen.\u00a0 While both ads aired for the first time with less than a week to go before Election Day, they illustrate the diverging approaches of two campaigns in the final months of the campaign season. Since early September, Biden has outspent Mr. Trump by more than $200 million for television advertising, but data shows that's not the only major difference. An analysis of ads by Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group found Trump campaign ads since June took a more negative tone or contrasted with his opponent. In fact, for a period from mid-June through mid-August, all of the president's TV ads were negative or contrasting. Data shared with CBS News show the president only began infusing positive messaging in his appeals in late August, a trend that soon reversed itself in October with a return to negative and contrasting pitches. Meanwhile, Biden's advertising appeals feature a mix of positive and negative messaging. In late June and early July, Biden aired more positive ads than negative ads, according to Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group. The same goes for early August, and since the end of September, the majority of Biden's ads have all been positive. Notably absent from much of the Democratic challenger's paid airtime? The president himself. \"There's a state specific message in each of these [battlegrounds], whether it's fracking, say in Pennsylvania, or whether it be standing with law enforcement and opposing \"defund the police\" in Michigan and Wisconsin,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters, Monday. But there's a candidate-specific message, too, built on driving down his Democratic opponent's favorability ratings. \"Biden's unfavorabilities are not nearly high enough for the Trump campaign,\" said Republican strategist Rob Stutzman, addressing the rationale behind the president's negative ads. \"They've had a mission to drive up Biden's negatives.\" A new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday shows more than half of Americans \u2014 including more than half of men (53%), seniors over the age of 65 (53%), and independent voters (57%) \u2014 view the president unfavorably, mirroring his position ahead of the 2016 election. According to the same survey, Biden's standing with Americans registers at 44% favorable to 43% unfavorable, although more men (49%), independents (48%), and white Americans (53%) view him unfavorably. Stutzman noted a key difference between 2020 and 2016: the Democratic presidential nominee is viewed much more favorably. \u00a0\"For Biden, it's the other side of the coin. Trump's negatives are already high. Trump continues to do that work on his own.\" Stutzman said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also continues to throw punches at his political opponent in a largely unsuccessful effort to reverse his favorability. \"I personally don't think [Biden's] a nice person, but that's okay,\" Mr. Trump said to thousands gathered at his campaign rally in Bullhead City, Arizona, on Wednesday. \"I don't think he's a nice guy.\" After Mr. Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis was revealed October 2, Biden's campaign also swiftly pulled down all of the attack ads it had placed on Facebook. Mr. Trump's campaign didn't follow suit \u2014 a Syracuse University data project revealed\u00a0the Trump campaign deployed digital attack ads at relatively steady rates before and after the diagnosis. As for the president's rare positive messaging on TV, four ads rolled out since late September made no mention of Biden. One ad highlighted rebuilding the military, another showcased protecting Medicare and social security, while the third and fourth touted his coronavirus response. The ads claim the president\u00a0 will end the U.S. reliance on China and \"eradicate the coronavirus\" and that Mr. Trump,\u00a0 who underwent treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center for COVID-19, \"tackled the virus head on.\" As of October 20, more than 90% of the president's ads took a negative tone once more or provided comparisons between the candidates, underscoring Trump campaign advisors' longstanding efforts to prevent the 2020 race from playing out as a referendum on the president's handling of the virus.\u00a0 And while Biden has had more positive messaging, some of his ads do take on the president directly.\u00a0 \"This president has a lot to say about Black women. He's called us low IQ, unhinged and crazy,\" Black women say in one ad directly to camera. \"We are extremely motivated and ready to vote him out. \" In another ad, a Wisconsin farmer accuses the president of ending \"over a hundred years of family farming for me and for my neighbors.\"\u00a0 The two presidential campaigns' advertisement strategies also reflect the overall approaches to partisan spending in the final lap of 2020. A review of ads in 11 battleground states from the beginning of September through October 24 revealed total Republican affiliated ad spending on anti-Biden messaging totaled more than $157 million, far more than pro-Trump messaging which totaled less than $100 million.\u00a0 During that time, spending on pro-Trump messaging only outweighed anti-Biden messaging in only two states: Michigan and Texas. This did not apply to national cable and network ads.\u00a0 \"Typically, a more common role of the outside groups, of the super PACs, is to do the negative [ads], partially because it's an easier message to execute,\" said Stutzman. This was not the overall case this year for Democrats. They spent nearly $200 million over eight weeks on pro-Biden messaging, more than $40 million more than they spent on anti-Trump messaging.\u00a0 \"Joe Biden understands hard times because he's lived it,\" claims the narrator in an ad by Unite the Country PAC first aired in Pittsburgh. \"It's why his recovery plan will lift all of us.\" The only state where anti-Trump spending outweighed the investment in pro-Biden messaging since early September was in Florida. Pro-Biden messaging also outweighed anti-Trump messaging in national network and cable spending. \u00a0 CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

But in general, the term does not mean that police should be given zero funding or that police departments should be abolished, but rather that some portion of their funding should be diverted to community programs. \u00a0 What it means to \"defund the police\" is being explored nationwide by some of the candidates running for district attorney and county prosecutor, the law enforcement officials who have the power to directly hold police accountable. Progressive candidates told CBS News they interpret the phrase to mean reallocating some police funds for health care and education. And many would also like to see police forces demilitarized, fewer non-violent crimes prosecuted and an end to the cash bail system. CBS News spoke to several candidates, as well as former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, who is supporting district attorneys backing policing reform as part of their agenda. CBS News campaign reporters Jack Turman\u00a0and\u00a0Timothy Perry\u00a0and\u00a0political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0have more on how these candidates\u00a0view the \"defund the police\" movement and the larger reforms they want to make on criminal justice and police accountability.\u00a0 FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was the backdrop for Joe Biden's rebuttal to the rebirth of the Obamacare lawsuit today,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. The presumptive Democratic nominee first joined in on a socially-distanced discussion with families who said they benefitted from the expanded Obamacare protections.\u00a0 Biden told them the Trump administration lawsuit \"seems to me to be close to cruel\" and then agreed with one of the attendees that it is also \"unconscionable.\" In 18 minutes of remarks afterward, Biden whittled into President Trump for his \"twin legacies\" of \"failure to protect\" from COVID-19 while fighting his \"crusade\" to do away with the ACA.\u00a0 The former vice president said the president was acting \"like a child\" in terms of his COVID-19 response, focusing more on how testing rates make him look rather than focusing on help to those impacted by the virus. Biden reiterated his support to try to implement a \"public option\" in addition to Obamacare coverage if elected, which would offer Medicare-like plans to those wanting better coverage outside of employee-based healthcare. The Biden campaign also continued its battleground state rollout Thursday, announcing new leadership in North Carolina and Nevada.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that L.T. McCrimmon, a staffer from Governor Roy Cooper's office, will serve as the state director and the former North Carolina state director for Elizabeth Warren presidential campaign, Maggie Thompson, will take on the roles of State Advisor and Chief of Staff. Scott Falmlen, a partner at Nexus Strategies political consulting firm in North Carolina, will also serve as a strategic adviser.\u00a0 In Nevada,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports the former vice president has tapped two top staffers from the state Democratic party to head his general election campaign. Alana Mounce,\u00a0formerly the party's executive director, will serve the campaign as state director. Shelby Wiltz, who helmed the\u00a0last-minute shift\u00a0over the \"first in the West\" caucus plans in February,\u00a0will return\u00a0to head Democrats' coordinated campaign in the state. Much of Biden's organizing team in Nevada, where the former vice president\u00a0lost to Bernie Sanders\u00a0by more than 20 points, have since parted ways with the presidential bid. The campaign declined to identify how many of their former Nevada staffers would be offered an opportunity to return to Biden's general election team, if any. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP With visits from both the president and vice president this week, the political battleground state of Wisconsin is\u00a0back in the spotlight, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar,\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0Nicole Sganga. President Trump touched down in Wisconsin for the second time this year, to tour the Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard, which was recently awarded a $800 million contract with the U.S. Navy to develop a new missile frigate.\u00a0 About two hundred miles southwest, demonstrations raged into the night Tuesday outside Madison's state capitol as protesters smashed in statehouse windows, attacked a state senator and tore down two long-standing statues. Since the death of George Floyd in police custody, both cities and protesters have been taking down confederate statues nationwide. A new Marquette University Law School poll released on Wednesday reveals a majority of registered voters in the poll disapprove of Trump's handling of nationwide protests after the death of George Floyd in police custody (58%), his handling of the coronavirus pandemic (52%) and his job performance overall (51%).The survey shows presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden leading Mr. Trump in the state 49% to 41%, a jump from his three-point lead last month.\u00a0 \"We have the greatest testing program in the world,\" President Trump said Thursday, in Marinette. \"We've developed it over a period of time. We're up to almost 30 million tests. That means we're gonna have more cases. If we didn't want to test or if we didn't test we wouldn't have cases.\" In a call with reporters Thursday, Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield said for every reported case of COVID-19, there are 10 more undetected infections. Johns Hopkins University has tracked over 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US. Based on the CDC's new estimates of unreported cases, over 20 million Americans have had the virus. Dozens of Trump campaign staffers who worked the president's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Saturday will quarantine this week after interacting with at least 8 advanced staff testing positive for COVID-19. \"As a precaution staff who made the trip to Tulsa are working remotely, and they will be tested and return working to the office after that,\" said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign, in a call with reporters. CBS News has learned the Trump campaign chartered a plane for lawmakers, campaign advisors and surrogates ahead of Saturday's rally. Not every surrogate or lawmaker wore a mask on the plane, though they were made available, according to multiple Republican officials. Campaign officials received a COVID test before entering the arena in Tulsa. Also on Thursday Vice President Mike Pence rolled onto the stage during his visit to Ohio's Lordstown Motors plant riding in the passenger seat of a pickup truck. During his remarks,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports Pence touted the administration's economic success before the coronavirus pandemic. Citing low unemployment numbers among Black and Hispanic communities, the vice president declared \"the American dream came roaring back\" under President Trump. \"Our economy was on a roll,\" Pence said while also reassuring the crowd that \"the recovery is on\" and Lordstown Motors will be \"a part of the great American comeback.\"\u00a0 Later in the day, Pence visited the Youngstown Police Department. The Vice President's press secretary Devin O'Malley said in a statement that Pence's visit to the police department is to \"highlight their recent innovative police reform effort.\" Youngstown PD recently opened their use of force training to the community \"in order to promote transparency, open up communication, and build trust,\" O'Malley said. The Vice President delivered brief remarks at the police station, saying \"we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and support for our African-American community.\" Pence, who's been referring to George Floyd's death as a tragedy and promising justice, continues to also couch the remark with lines like \"there is also no excuse for the rioting, and the violence, and the looting and the attacks on law enforcement that followed.\" Pence said every American can support law enforcement and the African-American community at the same time while coming \"together around better public safety.\" Pence is headed\u00a0to campaign in Arizona\u00a0next week, continuing his \"Faith in America\" tour on the heels\u00a0of a visit from President Trump\u00a0that packed a Phoenix mega-church \u2014 and drew some protests \u2014 on Tuesday. White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien had floated news of Pence's visit Wednesday, during remarks\u00a0to Arizona business leaders.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports the campaign event is planned in Tucson, at the heart of Arizona's Democrat-heavy Pima County where Trump lost by more than 13 points\u00a0in 2016, despite winning statewide by more than three points. Though the president has visited the state multiple times and bought\u00a0more than $1 million\u00a0in Arizona ad time, new polling released today\u00a0continues to show\u00a0President Trump lagging behind Joe Biden in the battleground state.\u00a0 CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES IN NORTH CAROLINA CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0In the latest edition of COVID Chronicles,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0continues to examine the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on Black business owners,\u00a0with a dispatch out of North Carolina. Patrick Williams, 45, had just become one of four business partners at Pier 34 Seafood & Pub in Goldsboro, when the restaurant closed due to the pandemic. Pier 34 continued to offer take-out and delivery options while the restaurant was physically closed but the team barely earned half of what they had been receiving per month. The restaurant has reopened and while it could sustain another six months at its current revenue, Williams said that it would be \"cutting it hard,\" and his team would eventually have to decide whether to keep their doors open or permanently close. According to\u00a0research\u00a0done by the University of California in Santa Cruz, there were more than a million black-owned businesses in the U.S. at the beginning of February. By mid-April, 440,000 Black business owners had permanently shut down \u2014 a 41% drop. Women-owned businesses saw a 25% plunge. Marc Bayard, the director of the Institute for Policy Studies' Black Worker Initiative, told CBS News that in some ways this data was unsurprising and ties into the much larger racial inequities and economic injustice that African-Americans have faced for a long time. \"If we think about the black-owned businesses that we've grown up with, they're smaller, they're individual entrepreneurs, they weren't well capitalized before,\" said Bayard. \"\u2026without the working capital, without the ability to access the federal loan programs\u2026it's pretty cataclysmic, the impact of some of the inability to get capital for these small businesses in this pandemic.\" Shalisha Morgan, the owner of\u00a0Geek in Heels\u00a0electronic repair business in Winston-Salem, applied for Small Business Administration loans during the pandemic but also decided to pivot and began offering curbside repair services throughout the state to keep her business alive. \"It was important that I worked seven days a week for as many hours as I could, doing what I needed to do because I knew that no Superman was coming in to save me and everyone felt like I did,\" said Morgan. 'I was very thankful that I was able to pivot my business model\u2026not every business is capable of doing that.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER HEALTH CARE Democrats on Thursday focused on health care as the Trump administration faced a deadline to file a brief with the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act. This comes as coronavirus cases in the United States surge and nearly 20 million people are facing unemployment due to the pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. In March, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case at the request of Democratic attorneys general seeking to reverse a lower court ruling. The initial case was brought by Texas, other Republican state officials and backed by the Trump administration seeking to dismantle the health care law. The case will be heard during the next term, which does not begin until October. \"The ACA is more popular than ever for one simple reason: it works,\" said DNC chairman Tom Perez Thursday in a statement ahead of the expected filing. \"The ACA has significantly reduced the ranks of the uninsured; it's helped Americans can get the health care they need and helped keep them from being bankrupted just because they get sick.\"\u00a0 JOBS The Department of Labor\u00a0announced\u00a0Thursday that 1.4 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance benefits last week,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports.\u00a0Oklahoma, Texas, New Jersey, New York and Louisiana saw the largest increases in unemployment applications when compared to the rest of the country. In May, CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0that nearly 3.2 million Americans had applied for unemployment insurance benefits. Weeks later\u00a0forecasters were confounded\u00a0when the unemployment rate fell to 13.3% and the Labor Department announced that employers had added 2.5 million jobs in May, after months of Americans taking economic hits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Still, unemployment figures are just one measure of the economic toll that Americans have endured throughout the pandemic. And as\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this week in\u00a0CBS News COVID Chronicles, small business owners in battleground states like Florida are still recovering from the negative economic impacts of COVID-19. MOTHERS ON A MISSION Star power meets political power in a new letter to Congress spearheaded by Beyonce's mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson. Her daughters, Beyonce Knowles Carter and Solange, are among the A-list signatories which include Jada Pinkett Smith, Whoopi Goldberg, Halle Berry, Kerry Washington and other African-American entertainers.\u00a0 It is co-penned by Mothers of the Movement, a coalition of Black mothers who have lost their children to police brutality and gun violence. \"I'm not a politician. I am not an activist, in that public sense, but I just felt like I had to do this,\" Knowles-Lawson told\u00a0CBS This Morning co-anchor Gayle King. \u00a0 \"It all comes down to having the polling places open, where is that money going to come from?\"\u00a0 Tamika Palmer, mother of Breonna Taylor, added, \"It is important that people vote and that they're given this opportunity.\"\u00a0 Taylor was a 26-year-old medical worker killed in March during a police encounter at her Louisville home. The open letter sent to Senate leaders Thursday urges passage of the HEROES Act, which includes $3.6 billion in election funding.\u00a0 It reads: \"Fall-out from the most recent primaries makes it abundantly clear that we must act now to ensure every citizen can freely and fairly vote in the upcoming general election.\"\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0reports the congressional push is also coupled with a public petition organized by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, All Voting is Local and its 'And Still I Rise' campaign. The organization held a virtual discussion on voting rights Wednesday night with Knowles-Lawson and the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Ahmaud Arbery.\u00a0 CAMPAIGN STRATEGY ON THE MOVE After months of virtual campaigning due to the coronavirus, in-person activity is slowly starting to creep back up depending on where states are with reopening, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. On Thursday, the Progressive Turnout Project, whose mission is to get Democrats to the polls, announced it will begin door-to-door canvassing in some metro areas Saturday. The PAC, which is investing more than $52 million this election cycle, will have upcoming activity in Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Colorado.\u00a0 Their 2020 goal is to knock on more than 10 million doors and get out the vote in 17 states for the presidential and Senate races. According to PTP, conversations will focus on helping voters make a plan to vote safely including by mail. They're targeting a mix of voters including those under 35, voters of color and people who stayed home in 2016. \"Donald Trump's response to the pandemic and recent protests further prove that he is fundamentally incapable of doing his job,\" said Executive Director Alex Morgan in a statement.\u00a0\"It's essential that we get to work now by having the kind of early, face-to-face conversations that our research shows boost Democratic turnout.\"\u00a0 Morgan said the group is taking precautions to protect both staff and voters. With that in mind, PTP is deciding to launch based on metro areas meeting several public health criteria including areas that proceeded at least 28 days without stay-at-home orders and gatherings of 10 people or more. Locations must also have flat or decreasing coronavirus cases, large COVID-19 testing capacity, and be cleared for canvassing with an infectious disease expert. Measures also include providing staff with masks, disinfectant wipes, and hand sanitizer, maintaining social distancing including when talking to voters, and setting guidelines to not enter voters' homes or apartment buildings. TPT's effort to turn out Democrats comes soon after the RNC and Trump campaign recently resumed in-person campaigning with door knocking and in-person volunteer training sessions. \u00a0 Meanwhile, the progressive organization ACRONYM is kicking off the first wave of an $11 million voter registration and mobilization effort. The campaign called People's Power Grab, aims to register and turnout 100,000 people of color across eight states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. This week, the group is launching a $250,000 digital ad buy as part of its effort. ACRONYM's campaign comes as the organization hopes to fill the void with on-the-ground voter registration efforts taking a hit due to the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign will include ads through Election Day on platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, as well as on streaming services and other less traditional platforms. While the People's Power Grab registration effort is nonpartisan, ACRONYM is affiliated with PACRONYM, a committee launched in an effort to take on Donald Trump. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE SENATE MISSISSIPPI U.S. Democratic Senate Candidate Mike Espy attended a demonstration Thursday at the Mississippi State Capitol urging the State Legislature to take the Confederate Flag out of the Mississippi state flag, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. \"It an ugly symbol, meaning it harkens back to an ugly time when people owned other people,\" Espy said, \"The flag is a divisive symbol and symbols should be unifying.\" Espy joined religious leaders Thursday in Jackson to pressure lawmakers to take action before they wrap up the 2020 legislative session on Friday. Espy is also again campaigning against GOP Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith in November. Espy lost a Special Election runoff to Hyde-Smith in 2018. GOVERNOR'S MANSION HITTING PAUSE While coronavirus cases are on an upward trend in multiple states, governors in the south are seeing especially high spikes. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott\u00a0paused their reopening\u00a0after seeing 5,551 new cases Wednesday and 13 days of increasing hospitalizations reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In a release, the Republican governor also put a stop on elective surgeries.\u00a0 \"The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business,\" said Abbott. Businesses that were already permitted to open under the state's previous phases of reopening can \"continue to operate at the designated occupancy levels and under the minimum standard health protocols provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services,\" according to the statement. The Texas Democratic Party launched digital ads on Thursday, criticizing Abbott's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and claiming he ignored the data about a second wave. And as the number of cases continues to rise Florida, a spokesperson for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that he is continuing to monitor COVID-19. \"The governor is not planning any rollback of Phase II reopening at this time,\" said the spokesperson, who added that \"he never announced a timetable for a Phase III.\" NEW HAMPSHIRE In New Hampshire, gubernatorial Democratic candidate Andru Volinsky was\u00a0condemned\u00a0by the Manchester Black Lives Matter chapter on Wednesday, after he opposed Republican Governor Chris Sununu's nominations of two black appointees to statewide positions, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 Eddie Edwards, a black conservative former law enforcement official, withdrew his nomination in a letter Tuesday, citing Volinsky's role as an executive councilor in the state to \"control over a majority of councilors\" and delay his confirmation hearing. Volinsky has opposed Edwards' nomination in the past, calling him \"unqualified.\" Earlier in June, Volinsky also had to apologize for using the term \"tokenism\" in a debate with Sununu about a nominee for the state Board of Education. On Facebook, Black Lives Matter Manchester\u00a0wrote, \"Andru Volinsky's microaggressive comments have no place in politics. We strongly disavow his statements claiming that a black man had no experience or expertise in earning his position for the office of professional licensure and certification.\"\u00a0 Volinsky, running as a progressive\u00a0who has supported\u00a0the Black Lives Matter movement, said in an apology he recognizes there's a \"different context\" to calling past, white nominees unqualified. \"There is a long history of Black people who have been unfairly dismissed as 'unqualified'; I failed to take that context into account when opposing these nominees. I look forward to engaging in honest and candid dialogue with Black Lives Matter Manchester and take to heart their criticisms about my words,\" he wrote.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "A year ago, Senator Ed Markey already faced two challengers and was behind in\u00a0polling by double digits to Congressman Joe Kennedy who hadn't even entered the race yet, but in the past year, Markey has put on a fight to make Tuesday a more competitive race than many expected.\u00a0 Markey is facing off Tuesday against Congressman Joe Kennedy III, the 39-year-old grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, in the Democratic Senate primary for a seat that will likely remain Democratic no matter who wins. Recent public polling has Markey up, but the Kennedy campaign hopes a coalition of voters from minority communities will show up on Election Day to put the legacy into the Senate. \u00a0\u00a0 The central message of the Kennedy campaign in the past few months has been about how a senator should represent its constituents. Nick Clemons, Kennedy's campaign manager, told CBS News that Markey doesn't show up whereas Kennedy is present across the state. According to The Boston Globe, Markey was in Massachusetts even less than Senator Elizabeth Warren while she was running for president. However, on the same day the Globe published that article, the editorial board of the paper\u00a0endorsed Markey in the Senate primary. Markey has built a coalition of young people and environmentalists who have been energized, helped in part by his relationship with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and their work together on the Green New Deal, legislation aimed at overhauling fossil fuel consumption. Kennedy, for his part, has not attacked Markey for his progressive ideas and supports many of the same goals, including the Green New Deal, and he is a co-sponsor of the U.S. House Medicare for All legislation. In primary debates, Kennedy criticized decisions Markey has made in his over 40 years in Congress like his vote for the Iraq war and for opposing busing to desegregate public schools in the 1970s. Markey rebutted that he changed his stance on busing years ago and was not the only Democrat in Congress wrong about the Iraq war at the time. \"Honestly, whatever the results, and I'm very hopeful and we're working hard to win, Markey's campaign manager John Walsh told CBS News. \"I think it's going to be a reality that in this race in Massachusetts in 2020 for the United States Senate between Ed Markey and Joe Kennedy III, Ed Markey has run a race on an urgent, positive agenda.\" The late primary, which was always scheduled for September 1, has allowed both campaigns to seize on the moment of unrest in the country throughout the summer in their campaigns. Both of the campaigns told CBS News they will spend their last few days focused on racial inequities in the justice system, the economic system, and in the education system in Massachusetts. \u00a0 Kennedy has been a rising star in the Democratic Party. He was first elected to Congress in 2012 and was chosen to give the party's response to Mr. Trump's 2018 State of the Union address, but since launching his campaign, he has been asked repeatedly why he is running now. In his campaign launch, Kennedy said \"we have a Senate that instead of trying to harness the opportunity of every person in this country, they're trying to pull us back, and I'm running for the United States Senate to tear that down, to fight back.\" He also told CBS News after launching his bid that he was running to bring about structural reform to make the economic system more fair. When asked if Markey was not doing these things, Kennedy said in September last year that he would do better than Markey on delivering change to Massachusetts.\u00a0 Both campaigns have been rolling out endorsements in the final weeks before the primary. Markey's endorsements include Ocasio-Cortez, Warren, Senator Cory Booker and Representative Carolyn Maloney, as well as climate change groups like the Sunrise Movement. But Kennedy in the past week added Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to his list of endorsements. \"Never before have the times demanded that we elect courageous leaders as today, which is why I'm pleased to join so many of my colleagues in endorsing Joe Kennedy III for Senate,\" Pelosi said in a video recorded for the campaign. \"He knows that to achieve progressive change, you must be on the front lines leading movements of people. Massachusetts and America need Joe Kennedy's courage and leadership in the Senate.\" Thirty other House members have endorsed Kennedy and on Sunday, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke endorsed Kennedy.\u00a0 Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Seth Moulton from Massachusetts both have said they will not endorse in the primary. Kennedy has in the past few months leaned into the history that comes with his name on the campaign trail and in ads. The campaign brought on in July political strategist Tad Devine, who produced television ads for the late Senator Ted Kennedy. In a\u00a0recent ad, the narrator says, \"Joe Kennedy knows how a legacy is earned, in communities where a leader lives and works, in quiet conversations with people grieving and struggling, in a fight he and his family have made for generations,\" with soundbites of speeches from Kennedy's ancestors. Massachusetts' Secretary of State William Galvin said last week that over 1 million people have requested ballots for the primary, setting the opportunity for this race to outpace the 21.9% turnout in 2018's statewide primary. \u00a0 \"We are feeling the higher this turnout goes, the better the turnout for Joe Kennedy is,\" Kennedy's campaign manager Nick Clemons told CBS News. \"We know our voters are more likely to vote on Election Day. They're not early voters, they're not vote by mail folks, so we're pushing our coalition out the door, phone banking, texting, everything we can do to get them out to vote.\" The campaigns have racked up an impressive amount of cash for a Senate primary in what many consider a safely Democratic state. Kennedy outraised Markey in two fundraising quarters this cycle, but from April to June, Markey outraised him by just about $50,000. From July to the middle of August, Markey raised about 600,000 more than Kennedy and spent just under $3 million in that time period. Kennedy's campaign, on the other hand, has made a final sprint into the primary, spending about $4.4 million, according to the latest financial filing. \u00a0 If Kennedy loses, he would be the first Kennedy to ever lose an election in Massachusetts since John F. Kennedy entered Congress in 1947.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "Michael Porter, a former Marine, said he usually receives his medication from the Department of Veterans Affairs within three to four days of ordering it. His last prescription refill, however, took 10 days to reach his home.\u00a0 \"I was worried they just weren't coming. I was like, 'This is ridiculous',\" Porter, 46, said of the prescription, which he ordered on August 12 but didn't receive until August 22. Because of the delay in delivery to his home in Maryland, Porter was without his medication, which treats his suicidal ideation, for three days. \"This is affecting me \u2014 and it's obviously affecting other people, too.\"\u00a0 Porter is among a number of Americans who are taking to social media to document delays in their mail-order prescriptions amid recent operational changes at the U.S. Postal Service under Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. While members of Congress are questioning DeJoy today about the effect of those changes on mail-in voting in the November election, consumers say they're being affected now, citing ongoing delays for everything from Amazon deliveries to mail-order prescriptions.\u00a0 In the latter case, a delay in prescription deliveries can have a very real adverse impact. Porter, for one, said his mind started to get in a \"dark space\" during the three days he was without treatment because his antidepressant was late. But he added he was buoyed by the positive comments he received after he posted about the delay on Twitter.\u00a0 I am a disabled Marine veteran.I am suicidal and on antidepressants.I'm still waiting for my refill... https://t.co/HcUGvO1lWl More than 14 million people receive mail-order prescriptions via Medicare, the insurance program for seniors, and through private insurance, the Kaiser Family Foundation found in a recent study. On top of that, about 330,000 veterans receive medications each day through the mail, according to ConnectingVets.com.\u00a0 \"The United States Postal Service is an important part of our society and it does a lot more for everyday people including military veterans than just handle our mail-in votes in biannual or quadri-annual elections,\" Porter said. \"What it's doing is screwing over people like me and thousands of others that depend on the USPS.\" During the Monday hearing, DeJoy defended his stewardship of the Postal Service and accused Democrats of spreading \"misinformation\" about his actions. Under questioning from Democrats, DeJoy refused to commit to replacing mail-sorting machines that had been removed from facilities in recent weeks, a move that raised alarms about delays in delivery.\u00a0 The operational changes \"have potential implications that extend beyond those for the election,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation researchers noted. \"Mail service delays could affect a relatively large number of people in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" It's possible the ranks of Americans relying on the postal service for their prescriptions are far higher now than Kaiser's estimate of 14 million people, since its analysis is based on orders placed in 2018 \u2014 before the pandemic shifted consumer preferences toward online ordering. That's an issue stressed by the AARP in an August 17 letter to DeJoy that asked him to suspend operational changes.\u00a0 \"More than ever before, people are relying on the USPS to deliver their lifesaving prescription medications and other necessities, allowing them to remain safely at home,\" the seniors' advocacy group said. The delays have also affected farmers and consumers awaiting packages, payments and letters.\u00a0 At least 4,800 chicks shipped to Maine farmers through the U.S. Postal Service arrived dead in the weeks since rapid cuts hit the federal mail carrier's operations, U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree said. Pingree, a Maine Democrat, raised the issue of the dead chicks and the losses farms are facing in a letter to DeJoy and U.S. Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sonny Perdue, The Portland Press Herald reported Wednesday. In California, postal employees reported that delays had caused other snafus, including boxes of rotting food that attracted rats and vermin, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month. As for mail-order medications, the delays are most likely to affect people in rural states, with Kentucky and West Virginia having the second- and third-highest per capita rate of mail-order medications, after Ohio, according to another KFF analysis. As for Porter, the former Marine, he plans to order his refills far in advance to avoid going days without his medication. He added, \"I'll order the next batch weeks out.\"",

            "article_content": "Coronavirus continues to take an unprecedented toll on American workers. Nearly 17 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance between March 15 and April 4, as businesses around the country close their doors due to the pandemic. The Labor Department reported on Thursday morning that 6.6 million Americans filed initial unemployment insurance claims for the week ending April 4. That was a slight dip from last week's record number, which the Labor Department has revised to more than 6.8 million claims. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0notes from 2009 to 2020, the U.S. economy gained about 20 million jobs. In the past three weeks, a staggering 16.78 million people have for unemployment insurance. It's as if the entire adult populations of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin filed for employment benefits, according to the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute. The American job crisis is expected to continue growing. Oxford Economics experts\u00a0project\u00a0as many as 30 million U.S. jobs could be lost due to Coronavirus. Also on Thursday, the U.S. Senate\u00a0failed to approve legislation\u00a0that would have expanded funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides loans to small businesses to help alleviate the effects of the Coronavirus, according to\u00a0CBSNews.com political reporter Grace Segers. FROM THE (PRESUMPTIVE) CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN A day after Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race, Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, took two steps closer to Sanders' signature progressive policies,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 Today Biden said he now favors dropping the eligibility for Medicare to 60, lowering the current age by five years. This is an effort by the campaign to provide another option for those still working ahead of retirement. Second, Biden wants to forgive student loan debt for debt-holders earning up to $125,000, who attend public colleges, HBCUs, or private minority-serving institutions.\u00a0 As for how it would be funded, the plan promises, the campaign floated one pay-for mechanism: repeal the high-income \"excess business losses\" tax cut in the recently-passed CARES Act, the COVID-19 relief bill. The Biden campaign argues that this only benefits the \"richest Americans\" and is \"unnecessary\" for relief efforts. For both ideas, Biden hat-tipped his former rival: \"Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas,\" Biden stated in a release.\u00a0 ISSUES THAT MATTER VOTING RIGHTS Leaders from the\u00a0Campaign Legal Center\u00a0hosted an hour-long press call Thursday, outlining ways that states should expand vote-by-mail options for voters amid the COVID-19 public health crisis. Just seven months out from the general election,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says CLC leaders insisted that taking immediate steps like extending early voting and eliminating excuse-required absentee voting could be game changing and may help prevent some of the issues that arose during the Wisconsin primary earlier this week.\u00a0 \"We will need a dramatic extension of vote-by-mail options, as well as expanded early voting sites, to spread out in-person voting and drive-by voting options,\" said CLC president Trevor Potter during the press call. \"All of these require adequate funding from the federal government to enable states already in budget crisis status because of the economy, to pay for these alternative voting methods.\" Some of the suggested changes could require changes in state law. Because state legislatures are having limited meetings because of nationwide stay-at-home orders in various places, the CLC insists that the time to raise the alarm about solutions for voter access expansion is now.\u00a0 \"It will be a long time before the nation forgets the harrowing images we saw of determined voters in Wisconsin on Tuesday wearing masks and braving long lines on a cold Wisconsin day at the peak of a global pandemic,\" said CLC Vice President Paul Smith. \"In some sense, the silver lining of the kind of election catastrophe that we've seen in Wisconsin and in Ohio last month, is that this issue has become very real and very tangible because we're seeing the long lines, and we're seeing the election administrators at the county level crying out for assistance,\" added Jonathan Diaz, who is the Voting Rights Counsel for the CLC. \"It's become, I think a very concrete issue that state legislatures and Congress can really\u2026see. It's not like a theoretical policy dispute anymore.\" AD WARS PAC ATTACK The Pro-Trump America First Action PAC announced it's making a $26.6 million investment in battleground states.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports the effort includes $18.5 million in TV ad buys in Florida and $8 million in TV ad buys in North Carolina. \"America First is making the Florida and North Carolina reservations because we are confident we can secure inventory at the best possible rates in these crucial battleground states,\" said America First Action President Brian O. Walsh in a statement. The PAC will make further decisions as well in May. Last week, America First announced it would invest $10 million in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. These digital, TV and mail efforts through the end of May are focused on criticizing Biden. The move comes as two Democratic Super PACs announce their own new digital investments in battleground states this week, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida. That group of ads focuses on President Trump's coronavirus response. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE The Congressional Leadership Fund PAC, backed by House Republican leaders, announced a $43 million ad booking in targeted districts for November. Their reservation comes just days after the House Majority PAC, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, made its own $51 million ad booking. Both groups made their early buys to lock in lower rates ahead of the November general elections, when presidential and Senate ads will drive up the prices. CLF's list is mainly comprised of markets in the districts of House \"Frontline\" Democrats, or vulnerable members in Trump-won districts, which Republicans see as their path to reclaim the House.\u00a0 CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that CLF's and HMP's buys, a combined $94 million dollars, overlap in at least nine markets and states. Some notable areas that will see a decent-sized combined investment are Iowa (about $9 million), Philadelphia (more than $12 million) and Atlanta (about $8 million).\u00a0 Though both groups say their rollouts are just the first wave of more to come, there are notable gaps in both initial lists. CLF has invested about $5 million in New York and $4.6 million in California, markets HMP has not invested in yet due to it not being a competitive Presidential or Senate battleground.\u00a0 HMP has more than $5 million slated across Texas, a battleground being targeted by House Democrats, while the CLF only has a buy slated for Houston, where it's spending $3.1 million in its efforts to unseat Democrat Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in Texas' 7th District. \"House Democrats are panicked about losing their majority and this is the first step towards making that a reality... The investment we're making today is just the first of multiple offense-focused advertising reserves to ensure Nancy Pelosi's days as Speaker are numbered,\" said CLF President Dan Conston. Republicans need at least 18 seats to win back the House.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Several rural-state governors alerted President Trump on Monday that they are struggling to obtain urgently needed medical supplies and testing equipment, warning that despite the\u00a0worsening coronavirus situation in New York\u00a0and other urban areas, more sparsely populated parts of the country need help, too. In response to requests for more testing kits, Mr. Trump said, \"I haven't heard about testing in weeks,\" according to an audio recording of the call between the president and governors obtained by\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.\u00a0 During the call, Democratic and Republican governors detailed how they are struggling to obtain the protective equipment doctors and nurses will need to treat the sick and the test kits needed to determine whether sick residents are suffering from COVID-19. \"We understand the challenges in New York. I have family in New York,\" Wyoming Republican Governor Mark Gordon told the president. But, he told Mr. Trump, \"I think a little bit of supply going our way could get us better prepared going forward.\" Mr. Trump replied, \"Good point\u2026Thank you very much, Mark. If you have a problem, call me. I'll get you what you need.\" Montana Democratic Governor Steve Bullock noted that delays in testing state residents could soon overwhelm hospitals in rural population centers and griped that his buying power has been repeatedly \"trumped\" by the federal government, a far larger customer for supplies and equipment. \"I could give four or five examples over the last week where we have supply orders and they've subsequently been cancelled and they're cancelled in part because what our suppliers are saying is that federal resources are requesting it and trumping that,\" Bullock said.\u00a0 Bullock also warned \"we're going to have some real problems\" across smaller rural states if they cannot soon obtain the necessary testing equipment. He cited Gallatin County, which encompasses Bozeman, as a population center that is seeing a growing infection rate. \"So we're trying to shift the supplies to really isolate that and do contract tracing, but we don't even have enough supplies to do the testing,\" Bullock said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump replied, \"I haven't heard about testing in weeks. We've tested more now than any nation in the world. We've got these great tests and we'll come out with another one tomorrow that's, you know, almost instantaneous testing. But I haven't heard anything about testing being a problem.\" Navy Admiral Brett Giroir, head of the Public Health Service and overseeing the push to distribute coronavirus test kits, interjected, explaining that the federal government is purchasing for each state at least 15 recently-approved test kits that can confirm a coronavirus diagnosis within four minutes. \"We're going to get that to your state lab as soon as possible,\" Giroir said. Read more here FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Even before last night, when President Trump questioned why hospitals were using so many face masks so quickly, his re-election campaign had been talking about mask shortages, accusing Joe Biden and the Obama administration of not refilling the national stockpile with N95 respirator masks. But Biden recently denied responsibility and said the White House did not follow the guidance the Obama administration left for them.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0looked into why the U.S. only had 30 million masks ready for use as COVID-19 spread globally.\u00a0Read his story\u00a0about how, under the Obama administration and Trump administration, \"a combination of differing priorities, underfunding and slow responsiveness all contributed to the shortfall of masks.\" As he tries to push forward with his campaign, Biden today said the \"best [he] could do\" was to try to balance his criticism for the president's COVID-19 response against the backdrop of a concerned nation. The former vice president said on MSNBC that it was \"absolutely bizarre\" for Mr. Trump to insult and \"belittle\" governors with whom he disagrees, like Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer and Washington's Jay Inslee.\u00a0 \"Step up and do your job. Stop campaigning,\" Biden said, asking again for the White House to order additional manufacturing of personal protective equipment under the Defense Production Act. He also took time to say what wouldn't help the current emergency response: \"Medicare for All;\" he argued that a single-payer healthcare system would not improve funding or overcrowding of hospitals. LIFE AFTER 2020 AMY KLOBUCHAR Senator Amy Klobuchar joined advocates from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Giffords Law Center today to highlight the growing threat to domestic violence victims during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. \"Think about what we say to victims when they call and ask for help on the hotline. We say, 'leave the house, leave the house.' And the opposite message \u2013for good public health reasons\u2014is being conveyed right now,\" Klobuchar told reporters on a conference call.\u00a0 What's also on her mind is the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which expired last year, plagued by stalled legislative negotiations and lack of Senate support.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the House bill included a provision preventing individuals with domestic violence convictions from purchasing a firearm. \"There's just no reason to stop this bill right now,\" a frustrated Klobuchar said, calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take action.\u00a0 \"It should be one that goes through unanimously,\" she said.\u00a0 The historic $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress last week included $2 million in funding for the Domestic Violence hotline and $45 million for programs providing shelter and other services to homeless individuals. Klobuchar also floated attaching the reauthorization to the next legislative package. \"You could attach it somehow to the next legislative package. There's all kinds of things you can do, but this thing waited way too long,\" Klobuchar remarked. \"And now we're going to see more than ever, why we need it in place.\" Julia Weber, Giffords Law Center implementation director, told reporters that while data is still emerging on COVID-19 pandemic's impact on gun purchases, there has been a 36% increase in background checks nationwide in the month of February, with a substantial portion of the firearm sales going to first-time gun buyers. Experts also stressed that the economic impact of COVID-19 hits survivors particularly hard. \"If they lose their jobs and can't pay their rent, they often have to choose between facing homelessness or returning to an abusive relationship,\" said Rachel Graber, Policy Director of National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. GOVERNOR'S MANSION GUBERNATORIAL ORDERS After a Siena College Poll showed overwhelming approval for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's handling of the coronavirus, Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that he wouldn't mind running against Cuomo. \"I've known Andrew for a long time. I wouldn't mind that but I'll be honest, I think he'd be a better candidate than sleepy Joe,\" Trump said.\u00a0 Biden and Bernie Sanders are the only remaining Democratic presidential candidates, and Cuomo dismissed Trump's comments in his daily press conference. \"I'm not going to rise to the bait of a political challenge. I'm not running for president, I was never running for president,\" he said. \"My only goal is to engage the president in partnership. This is no time for politics.\" CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports that the new\u00a0Siena College Poll\u00a0of registered New York voters shows 87% of New Yorkers approve of the job Cuomo has done handling the pandemic, compared to 11% who disapprove.\u00a0 Cuomo's marks are higher than they are for any other individual or group, including President Trump, Vice President Pence, local health departments, the CDC, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Congress. Some 41% of New Yorkers say they approve of the job Trump is doing with coronavirus, compared to 56% who disapprove. New Yorkers' views on Cuomo and coronavirus has caused the governor's favorability rating to skyrocket up to 71%, his best since January 2013.\u00a0 His net favorability ratings, showing the difference between favorable and unfavorable ratings, jumped from -6 points, a net negative rating meaning his unfavorable rating was higher than favorable, in the February poll to +48 points in the March poll. New York recently got some tangible help from the federal government on Monday when the\u00a0USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds, arrived on Manhattan's West side. Another Navy hospital ship, the USNS Mercy, arrived in Los Angeles over the weekend.\u00a0 The Comfort will not treat COVID-19 patients, but will be a \"relief valve\" to overcrowding hospitals, Cuomo said. Nearby, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, chair of the Democratic Governor's Association, talked about working with the Trump administration to get more medical supplies.\u00a0 \"I don't wake up every morning with the choice to say, 'Okay, who's going to be my president today?' The President is Donald Trump, the Vice President is Mike Pence, there's one federal administration. We need the feds, the feds need us,\" Murphy said. \"While we still have a big ask out standing on things like PPEs and ventilators, slowly but surely we're chipping away at that and we won't relent until we get our fair share,\" he said.\u00a0 Down the coast,\u00a0Maryland's\u00a0and\u00a0Virginia's\u00a0governors both issued official \"stay-at-home\" orders on Monday.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0counts at least 29 states that have issued these types of orders so far. \"We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home, we are directing them to do so,\" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said at his press conference, where he also said all non-essential businesses must close or move to telework. Hogan said Sunday that cases in the DMV area have quadrupled, and that by Easter, \"we're going to be looking a lot more like New York.\" The respective Departments of Health in the DMV have reported at least 2,470 COVID-19 cases so far.\u00a0 CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE New York Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez said she has been diagnosed with a presumed case of coronavirus, and will self-isolate in her home. She said she began to feel under the weather Sunday morning, but after speaking to the attending physician, it has not been recommended that she visit a doctor or take a COVID-19 laboratory test.\u00a0 \"I am carefully monitoring my symptoms, working remotely and in constant contact with my staff. I'll continue my work on behalf of New Yorkers as together we overcome this virus,\" she said in her statement. Velazquez is the fifth U.S. House member reported to have been diagnosed with the coronavirus.\u00a0 On the campaigning side, the National Republican Congressional Committee is expected to spend $690,000 in a cable ad buy for veteran Mike Garcia in California's 25th District. Garcia is facing Democrat and California Assemblywoman Christy Smith in a May special election for Katie Hill's old seat. The May 12 special election will be an \"all-mail ballot election\" after Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order.\u00a0 In New Mexico, John Blair, a Democratic candidate for the 3rd District's open seat, started airing his first\u00a0television ad\u00a0Monday in which he gives out his phone number. In the ad, Blair is seen on the phone, listing his stances on not taking corporate PAC money and passing an assault weapons ban. \"A real strategy of our campaign from very start is being accessible and being able to really communicate with voters about what we're doing,\" Blair told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0in a phone call Sunday.\u00a0 \"We want to be open and available to all voters and really have that dialogue and do it in a different way now that we can't be out traveling the district the way we were before.\" Blair is part of a crowded Democratic primary for Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n's seat, as Luj\u00e1n is currently running for the Senate. DELEGATE MATTERS PLAYING BY THE RULES The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the DNC will hold a public meeting that has not yet been scheduled to determine how to allocate the delegates of the three states (Kentucky, Louisiana, and New York) who have postponed their primary past the window outlined in the DNC rules.\u00a0 The RBC has jurisdiction over approving state parties' plans to elect and send delegates to the national convention. According to the rules, all contests must be held by June 9, and all delegates must be elected by June 20.\u00a0 Violating these rules could lead to penalties that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. If they penalize the states holding primaries later, the magic number to clinch the nomination would be less than 1,991. In several states, the elections of the actual people to fill delegate slots won by candidates in the primary take place weeks after the primary.\u00a0 Because of the coronavirus outbreak, several state parties are having to rejigger when, where, and how to hold their conventions to elect the actual delegates.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0has obtained a memo from the RBC chairs and DNC party staff from Friday, March 27, that said the RBC has received proposed amendments to delegate selection plans from 22 states and Democrats Abroad.\u00a0 The changes consist of postponing when and where delegates are elected, canceling or combining meetings, modifying the rules, and exploring vote by mail. \u00a0The RBC chairs have not issued any formal guidance but are encouraging state parties to conduct delegate conventions virtually, via apps like Zoom, and if there's a need for a tabulated vote, to use mail-in ballots.\u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Cardi B has talked with presidential candidates in the past and she recently flexed her political muscles again when she joined Joe Biden for an ELLE Magazine interview. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with the music star and activist about the issues that matter most to her. To start off the Zoom interview, Biden told Cardi B that they may be related \u2014 his daughter used to call him \"Joey B\" growing up. After Cardi greeted Biden's daughter, Ashley, the interview took a serious turn.\u00a0 Biden asked Cardi B about the issues that interest her in this election, and her list was extensive. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Alm\u00e1nzar, said first she wants President Trump out, citing his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as one issue.\u00a0 \"And also what I want is free Medicare,\" she said. \"It's important to have free [health care] because look what is happening right now. Of course, I think we need free college. And I want Black people to stop getting killed and no justice for it. I'm tired of it. I'm sick of it.\" She said she wants \"laws that are fair to Black citizens and that are fair for cops, too. If you kill somebody who doesn't have a weapon on them, you go to jail. You know what? If I kill somebody, I've got to go to jail. You gotta go to jail, too. That's what I want.\" Biden responded by saying, \"There's no reason why we can't have all of that,\" and he stressed the importance of presidents taking responsibility, leveling with the American people and telling the truth.\u00a0 Biden urged young vote to turn out and vote, saying that if more 18- to 24-year-olds had voted in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have been president instead of Donald Trump. \"The vote matters,\" Biden said. \"That's why you keep talking to people about the need to vote. Your generation can own what happens in the next election. They can change things dramatically if they show up and vote.\" During the Zoom conversation, the two bonded over being parents. Biden, who is 77, noted that he had four kids and five grandchildren. Cardi B, who is 27, has a 2-year-old daughter with her husband, fellow rapper Offset.\u00a0 She brought up her concern about the lack of after-school programs for kids, saying programs she grew up with are now disappearing from her neighborhood.\u00a0 \"I'm the guy that put in those after-school programs,\" Biden said. \"I was able to get $20 billion [for] more boys and girls clubs.\" He blamed the loss of such programs on people not wanting to pay taxes to support them. Biden also told Cardi B one of the things he most admires about her \"is that you keep talking about what I call equity\u2014decency, fairness, and treating people with respect.\" \"John Lewis, one of the great civil rights leaders, used to say the vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool you have,\" Biden said. He spoke of the civil rights movement, and how people are again demanding racial justice and change. Cardi B said the demand for change is simple: \"I feel like Black people, we're not asking for sympathy, we're not asking for charity\u2014we are just asking for equality. We are asking for fairness, and we are asking for justice. That is all. I feel like everything people are asking for is getting interpreted in a very different way. No, it's simple: We just want justice. We want to feel like America.\" Biden praised the younger generation, saying they are the \"smartest, the best educated, the least prejudiced, and the most engaged generation in history.\"\u00a0 \"Look what they're seeing now with this president. He's promoting hatred, prejudice, racism. Talking about protecting the Confederate flag when Mississippi takes it off their flag,\" Biden said. \"This is all about the game of making people hate each other. Because that's how he wins, by dividing us. Your generation is changing it.\" Cardi B said prejudice is dangerous and \"could be the start of a civil war.\"\u00a0 \"Everybody just wants the best for themselves, their future, their kids' future. I don't want to [have] to tell my kid, 'You have to be careful going to the store. Don't wear a hoodie. Please don't get stopped.' We don't want that,\" she said.\u00a0 Earlier in the primary season, Cardi B was a prominent supporter of Bernie Sanders, but once Biden ascended to the top of the Democratic field she came out and endorsed him. In addition to child care and health care, Cardi B said one of the issues she focuses on most \u2014 and one her fans are concerned with \u2014 is the need for free college. The rapper opened up about her own education and the struggle to transition from high school to college.\u00a0 \"I'm from New York, and when you're in high school or middle school, they give you a free MetroCard for you to be able to get to your school, and they gave me free lunch,\" she said. \"When I was in college, I didn't get any more [free] transportation. So I had to get a job, because I needed $5 every single day to be able to go from Washington Heights to Chambers Street. And I had to feed myself.\" The rapper said some days she had to wait until she got home to eat, because she was able to afford lunch. \"I was starving, and I felt so discouraged,\" she said. \"So I just feel like that is so important, to finance students while they're in college.\"\u00a0 Biden told Cardi B that if he is elected president, he'll push for families that make less than $125,000 to get free education. When the rapper asked if that would actually happen, the candidate said, \"Absolutely, positively.\" \"Just check me out; I've never broken my word. Never in my life,\" Biden said.\u00a0 Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

            "article_content": "When the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S., public health professionals were already busy battling another epidemic \u2013 the drug crisis in this country. President Trump announced Wednesday that the nation will launch enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to prevent drug cartels from exploiting the coronavirus pandemic. \"I've seen many families where they're wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife. Or whatever. Or all of them,\" he said of the effects of drug abuse at the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. \"And we don't want to lose ground.\" Yet, beyond U.S. ports of entry, substance abuse patients and health care workers fighting the opioid epidemic face\u00a0new challenges. \"COVID-19 is like a horrific tsunami that just killed us, exploded in the Northeast and is developing rapidly,\" Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"So, of course we're paying attention to it, and we get distracted from this other crisis that is also killing a lot of people.\" The opioid epidemic and the coronavirus pandemic \"have unfortunately crossed paths in a very lethal way,\" said Allegra Schorr, president of the Coalition of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Providers and Advocates of New York State (COMPA). Schorr represents over 45 organizations serving 41,000 recovery patients in New York, the state hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. She wants to strike the right balance between reducing both the spread of the disease and risk of overdose for patients using Medical Assisted Treatment. \"We're like a front line. We have to be able to keep our patients out of the hospital. We have to get that balance right. If they overdose, then they're going to be in the hospital taking up those resources,\" Schorr told CBS News. \"They could be in the emergency rooms. We have the potential of crashing the hospital system. We have to make sure that does not happen.\" BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders hit the cable airwaves this afternoon from his Burlington, VT home. He told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he agreed with the idea of a federal stay at home order. Of governors not declaring shelter-in-place laws for their states, Sanders said \"it is incomprehensible to me that we have governors who continue to think this is business as usual.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says Cooper asked about the plan Sanders intends to propose for the fourth coronavirus stimulus package, which includes monthly $2,000 unemployment checks and a Medicare expansion to cover all medical costs during the crisis. Sanders said \"it's going to be expensive\" but added that \"it's easier to preserve the economy than it is to rebuild it after a collapse.\" Later Friday afternoon, he spoke to MSNBC's Ali Velshi. When asked about his campaign's future, Sanders acknowledged, as he has before, that between his delegate deficit and lackluster polling the road ahead is difficult. But he expanded on that on Monday and gave a glimpse into his philosophy for pressing on. \"The key goal is to win. The other goal is to continue to fight to give people the opportunity to stand up for views they believe in,\" he said. Sanders also said that he is listening to his supports and some believe that the right thing to do is fight on so to continue to \"win\" the ideological and generational divide within the party. \"I think we are winning [the ideological] struggle,\" he said. \"A lot of supporters say we've got to continue until it becomes the reality of American society.\" PETE BUTTIGIEG Pete Buttigieg is creating a Political Action Committee named Win the Era and an affiliated nonprofit group. The PAC will support and endorse candidates in down ballot races, according to Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for Buttigieg. The former presidential candidate frequently said on the campaign trail that Democrats cannot \"get caught acting like the presidency is the only office that matters.\" In an email sent out to supporters of the PAC, Buttigieg outlined the themes and values of his PAC. He noted that his PAC will build a sense of belonging by supporting diverse candidates who represent \"generational leadership.\" The PAC will also focus on Democratic candidates competing in conservative areas of the country. \u00a0 Buttigieg's team has reached out to donors who contributed general election funds to Buttigieg's presidential campaign, asking them to redirect their contribution to the PAC. The general election funds would otherwise need to be refunded since Buttigieg did not become the Democratic nominee.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the formation of the PAC is one of the first steps Buttigieg has taken regarding his political future since he suspended his presidential campaign on March 1. Buttigieg's second term as South Bend, Indiana's mayor ended on January 1. The New York Times was first to report the story.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren and three House members are calling on the Trump administration to provide plans to help Puerto Rico overcome challenges the spread of coronavirus has presented that are unique to the island. In a letter dated yesterday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says Warren and Representatives Raul Grijalva, Nydia Velazquez and Joaquin Castro asked Vice President Mike Pence to explain within two weeks how the administration will ensure sufficient aid reaches Puerto Rico. \"As the pandemic and its effects continue to test the economic and health care systems around the world, we are deeply concerned about the extent to which Puerto Rico's existing economic, infrastructure, and public health gaps will exacerbate its impacts,\" they wrote. The lawmakers said that the administration failed to adequately respond after Hurricane Maria in 2017, and that over half of the island lives in regions with a shortage of primary care. They also say that Puerto Rico's GDP growth rate and high unemployment rate make its economy \"particularly vulnerable to further downturns spurred by COVID-19 response efforts\" and that the island's infrastructure still hasn't recovered from Maria.\u00a0 WISCONSIN Republican leaders in the Wisconsin Legislature are rejecting proposals from Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers to make sweeping changes to the upcoming April 7 election, CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster reports. Evers asked the Legislature to hold a\u00a0special session\u00a0on Saturday afternoon to vote on making the primary almost entirely vote-by-mail and significantly extending the deadlines for voting. Evers, a Democrat, asked state lawmakers to vote on a plan to send an absentee ballot by May 19 to every registered voter in the state who has not yet requested one. Under the proposal, the deadline to send in ballots would also be extended to May 26. The proposal also sought to essentially scrap in-person voting, except for local clerks providing a window for disabled voters and voters who have difficulty or are unable to read, write or understand English. But in a joint statement, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said they are not planning to take up Evers' proposals and believe \"the election should continue as planned on Tuesday.\" \"If the governor had legitimate concerns, we could have come to a bipartisan solution weeks ago,\" the joint statement said. \"The only bipartisan discussion we've had was to ensure the election would continue safely and to maximize the opportunity to vote absentee.\" Wisconsin has stood alone in refusing to move its primary as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Eleven states and Puerto Rico have delayed their primary dates, and five others have moved to conduct their primaries or caucuses with mail voting. A state Supreme Court seat and many other local races are also on the ballot in Wisconsin in addition to the presidential primary. Last week, Evers did not try to delay the election, but he did ask the legislature to provide absentee ballots to all registered voters, allow ballots to be postmarked up until Election Day and give clerks more time to count ballots. Election officials said that proposal would be difficult to achieve, and it was shot down by Republican leaders in the legislature. There has been a dramatic shortage of poll workers in Wisconsin which has caused cities to reduce polling locations. On Friday, Milwaukee announced it would only have 5 polling sites compared to its usual 180 locations. A day ago, a federal judge refused to move the state's primary but extended the deadline to return absentee ballots from 9:00 p.m. ET on April 7 to 5:00 p.m. ET on April 13. The judge said on Friday that election results can't be reported until that April 13 deadline. The Republican National Committee and Wisconsin Republican Party have appealed that decision.",

            "article_content": "Former Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma family doctor who earned a reputation as a conservative political maverick as he railed against federal earmarks and subsidies for the rich, has died. He was 72. Coburn, who also delivered more than 4,000 babies while an obstetrician in Muskogee, where he treated patients for free while in the Senate, early Saturday morning, his cousin Bob Coburn told The Associated Press. Tom Coburn had been diagnosed years earlier with prostate cancer. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted his condolences on Saturday morning. \"Senator Tom Coburn was a great conservative voice in the United States Congress and American physician whose legacy will live on. Karen and I send our deepest sympathies and prayers to his family during this tough time,\" Pence tweeted. Known for bluntly speaking his mind, Coburn frequently criticized the growth of the federal deficit and what he said was excessive government spending endorsed by politicians from both political parties. \"I've got a flat forehead from beating my head against the wall,\" he told voters during a town hall meeting in July 2010. First elected to the U.S. House during the so-called Republican Revolution in 1994, Coburn fiercely criticized the use of federal money for special state projects and was among the few members of Congress who refused to seek such projects for their home states. He represented northeastern Oklahoma for three terms, but didn't seek re-election in 2000 to keep a term-limit pledge. He returned to his medical practice in Muskogee before asking voters to send him back to Washington, this time to the Senate, so he could fight big spenders and ensure \"that our children and grandchildren have a future.\" He won an open U.S. Senate seat in 2004, and easily won re-election in 2010. He left the Senate in 2016, after promising not to seek a third term. Some conservative operatives considered recruiting Coburn to challenge against then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016, but he declined a run. \"Condolences to his family on the death of Tom Coburn. In 2016 I made the case to him for an independent run to hold aloft the banner of a decent conservatism and so Trump couldn't win. He considered it but said he couldn't due to health. So sorry to hear of this good man's death,\" Bill Kristol, a conservative political operative, wrote on Twitter. As a senator, Coburn released a series of reports on what he described as wasteful government spending. A 37-page report in 2011, dubbed \"Subsidies of the Rich and Famous,\" detailed nearly $30 billion spent annually in government subsidies, tax breaks and federal grant programs to millionaires. \"From tax write-offs for gambling losses, vacation homes, and luxury yachts to subsidies for their ranches and estates, the government is subsidizing the lifestyles of the rich and famous,\" Coburn wrote in the report. A joint report in August 2010 by Coburn and Arizona Senator John McCain, who died in 2018, criticized stimulus spending, including $1.9 million for international ant research and $39.7 million to upgrade the Statehouse and political offices in Topeka, Kansas. Coburn's stubbornness and thwarting of legislation considered worthy by Democrats frustrated then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \"You cannot negotiate with Coburn,\" Reid, a Democrat, declared in 2008. \"It's just something you learn over the years is a waste of time.\" During debate over the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011, Coburn was part of a bipartisan \"Gang of Six\" senators who supported an alternative plan to cut the deficit by almost $4 trillion over the next decade through budget cuts and increased revenue through changes to the tax code. Coburn also released a 614-page plan that outlined how the government could slash $9 trillion from the federal deficit over the next decade. Coburn's suggestion led to the elimination of a federal tax subsidy for ethanol later that year. In 2009, Coburn shrugged off some constituent complaints after the state's largest newspaper, The Oklahoman, ran a front-page photograph showing him hugging then-President Barack Obama after Obama spoke to a joint session of Congress. \"I'm not aligned with him politically. I don't know what people back home in Oklahoma would be worried about,\" Coburn told the paper. \"But you need to separate the difference in political philosophy versus friendship. How better to influence somebody than love them?\" Coburn said he and Obama had become friends during orientation as freshman senators in 2004. In a 2014 interview with \"60 Minutes,\" Coburn told CBS News' Lesley Stahl that he was \"proud of our country for electing Barack Obama.\" Born in Casper, Wyoming, on March 14, 1948, Coburn grew up in Muskogee, Oklahoma. After graduating from Oklahoma State University, he went to work at his family's business in Virginia, Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Opticals, from 1970 to 1978. He later attended medical school at the University of Oklahoma. By the time he jumped into politics \u2014 a decision he said was based on runaway government spending and his distaste for career politicians \u2014 he was married to his wife, Carolyn, with three children and had established a successful medical practice. While in the Senate, Coburn delivered babies for free after he was threatened with censure for violating Senate conflict-of-interest rules that prohibited him from receiving compensation for professional services. Coburn had several health scares during his time in office. He was treated for malignant melanoma in 1975, and in 2011, he underwent surgery for prostate cancer. But health woes didn't seem to damper his contentious attitude. After revealing in 2003, for example, that he had been diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy, he told a Tulsa World reporter: \"You should be writing about Medicaid and Medicare instead of my health.\" In the 2014 interview with Stahl, Coburn discussed his struggle with prostate cancer. \"You all have to die of something. The deal is how to use each day to move things forward, for both you and the people you love and the country you love,\" Coburn said.",

            "article_content": "Amy Klobuchar is feeling jubilant about her rise in fortunes, a third-place finish in New Hampshire that had her drawing support from both Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. The Minnesota Democrat's finish \u2014 behind only Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, and ahead of Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden \u2014 is buoying her political fortunes and making her a serious contender in future primary contests. Her campaign, she said, had beaten the odds, giving her the opportunity to introduce herself to voters outside of New Hampshire. \"Hello, America. I'm Amy Klobuchar and I will beat Donald Trump,\" Klobuchar announced after walking onstage in New Hampshire. \"My heart is full tonight. While there are still ballots left to count, we have beaten the odds every step of the way.\" The moderate Democrat captured voters' attention in debates, particularly in Friday night's debate in New Hampshire, where she impressed pundits and voters alike. She was also the first to speak during the Iowa caucuses, a savvy media move,\u00a0 while other candidates may have been waiting to see whether the state party would be able to release any results that night (it didn't). On Tuesday night, Klobuchar praised her supporters and thanked them for pushing her campaign forward. \"We love you New Hampshire!\" Klobuchar said to an enthusiastic crowd. \"Because of you, we are taking this campaign to Nevada. We are going to South Carolina.\" During her speech, Klobuchar herself identified the coalition she believes she can attract to forge a path to the Democratic nomination: \"a movement of fired-up Democrats, of independent moderates and Republicans that see the election as we do.\" These are the voters, she suggested, who see the election as a \"patriotism check\" and a \"decency check.\" The Minnesota senator received a boost in New Hampshire from a few specific groups that she'll also be relying on in the coming states. CBS News exit polling data shows Klobuchar did particularly well among those 65 years and older, and among college graduates. And she did especially well among white, female college graduates.\u00a0 She also gathered strong support from people who regularly attend religious services. Klobuchar split the support of moderates with Buttigieg. New Hampshire Democratic primary voters who made their decision in the last few days helped make the difference for Klobuchar, as well as those who factored the recent debate into their decision in the polling booth Tuesday.\u00a0 Klobuchar has been consistent in her messaging that she's a thoughtful, pragmatic moderate who can get things done in Washington because it's what she's already been doing in the Senate. On the trail, she touts her record of working across the aisle, and she's isn't afraid to push back against liberal policies like \"Medicare for All.\"\u00a0 Since Friday's debate, she has also been bringing up that she was the only candidate to raise a hand when moderator George Stephanopoulos asked if anyone was worried about having a democratic socialist \u2014 Sanders \u2014 at the top of the ticket. So, what's next for Klobuchar? After the adrenalin boost of New Hampshire, in the near term, she's adding more than 50 staffers in Nevada, and staffing up in Super Tuesday states.\u00a0 One campaign aide said Klobuchar will be \"springboarding\" into Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday states like Colorado, Tennessee, North Carolina and Minnesota.\u00a0 She plans to go to Nevada on Thursday, then on to the Super Tuesday states.\u00a0 But her path forward isn't clear yet in all areas. Klobuchar is struggling with support from black voters, a challenge ahead in South Carolina. And she lacks the financial resources afforded to some other candidates, such as Bernie Sanders, who has been consistently outraising the rest of the Democratic field.\u00a0 Klobuchar fought her way to a strong finish in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. But as the race turns to larger and more diverse states, she still has some battles ahead in her quest for the Democratic nomination.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson, Adam Brewster, Grace Segers, Musadiq Bidar contributed to this report.",

President Donald Trump lost New Hampshire by the slimmest margin of any state in 2016.\u00a0  Out on Turtletown Pond in Concord, \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil found two voters with opposing views who were \"breaking the ice\" with a friendly activity: ice fishing. \"I'm struggling with the presidential race this year,\" said Tim Moore, who said he is \"sort of\" a Democrat. Moore's fishing partner, Dennis Whitcher, leans more Republican. \"The division in this country is probably the biggest issue that I have right now. It's just heartbreaking,\" Moore said.  Health care is also top issue for Moore.  \"I'm self-employed, so it's expensive. It's very expensive,\" he said. But, he questioned how the country would pay for Medicare for All plans proposed by candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Another major issue for him is the climate, he said, as the three sat on the ice on an unseasonably warm day. \"Not just climate change,\" he said. \"I mean the Trump administration is rolling back protections on our water at a staggering rate.\" Whitcher, however, said he doesn't believe in climate change. \"It's a joke. You gotta be kidding me,\" he said. As Moore considers which Democrat might be able to help him, Whitcher has his own mixed feelings about Mr. Trump.  Asked what he thinks of the president's character, he said, \"That's a tough call.\" \"I think on a personal level, he has a good character,\" he said. \"But his public appearance \u2014 it's pretty crude.\" \"Do you think he's always honest?\" Dokoupil asked. \"I think he's an honest person, but he sure does tell a lot of lies,\" Whitcher said.  For now, Whitcher is willing to look past that because the economy is \"unbelievable,\" he said. \"I think his trade policies, you know, the tariffs, dealing with China has helped a lot, and he's managed to keep the farmers happy,\" he said.  At a bar in Manchester, others agree with Whitcher.  Asked what his favorite thing that Mr. Trump has gotten done, one supporter said, \"Everything.\"  Another said, \"I look at my kids' college funds, they've thrived, along with our 401s.\" But also at the bar, primary voters Deborah Tolz and Jessica Palmariello     expressed strong opposition to the president.  \"I really like Amy (Klobuchar),\" Tolz said. \"But I'm not sure if she can beat Trump or not.\" Asked if an ability to beat Mr. Trump is a big qualification for her, she said \"Oh, anybody but Trump.\" \"I have to agree with you on that one,\" Palmariello said. Back on the pond, Whitcher and Moore are as divided as anyone, but only politically. Asked what advice they have for the rest of the country to get along the way they are, Whitcher said, \"Go fishing. Makes life pretty easy.\"",

            "article_content": "Tuesday is the last day to sign up for Obamacare in 36 states, while another 14 and Washington, D.C. have later dates. The federal health insurance program \u2014 accessible at\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a0\u2014 has seen a crush of signups as the open enrollment deadline approaches, and coronavirus cases continue to surge.\u00a0 Over 915,000 people signed up for Obamacare from November 29 to December 5, the fifth week of open enrollment and most recent data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' weekly enrollment snapshot. That's nearly double the week prior, when 523,020 people selected plans, which itself was about a 50% increase from the same time period last year. According to CMS, about 8.3 million people enrolled or were automatically re-enrolled in the program during the 2020 open enrollment period, over 2 million of whom were \"new consumers.\" And, as of June 2019, 14 million people who were made newly eligible for coverage under the ACA's Medicaid expansion, adopted by 39 states, enrolled in coverage, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 300,000 people have now died from the coronavirus in the U.S., according to\u00a0data\u00a0from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has set records for COVID-19 hospitalizations for eight days in a row, and the number of patients requiring intensive care is up 80% from a month ago.\u00a0 Coverage for those who make the deadline will begin January 1, a handful of weeks before the program's most prominent opponent, President Trump, leaves office. Mr. Trump campaigned on \"repealing and replacing\" Obamacare during the 2016 election, and kept on message, albeit unsuccessfully, throughout his presidency.\u00a0 In June, when close to half a million Americans had lost health insurance through their employer due to the economic shutdown brought on by the pandemic, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which authorized Obamacare. By August, the number of Americans who had lost their health insurance jumped to six million \u2014 or, at least 12 million when spouses and children are taken into account, according to\u00a0research\u00a0from the Economic Policy Institute. At the center of the\u00a0case before the Supreme Court\u00a0is the constitutionality of the so-called \"individual mandate,\" an original statute of the act that required those who could afford health insurance, but opted out, to pay a fee when they filed taxes. Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the unpopular fine, and a federal appeals court determined the mandate was unconstitutional at this time last year. Texas and other conservative-led states have since argued that the mandate's unconstitutionality renders the entire ACA unconstitutional.\u00a0 That argument, however, has not exactly been met with a warm reception by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three justices appointed by President Trump, both signaled they disagree with arguments made by the Republican-led states. Roberts said he believes that if Congress had wanted the full act to fall, it would have struck it down itself, adding that it's not the Supreme Court job's to do so. \"It's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act,\" Roberts told Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins, who argued on behalf of the 18 red states challenging the law. A final decision from the court is expected by June.\u00a0 Analysts and advocates who follow Obamacare sign-ups say interest in the program has only grown stronger as the coronavirus pandemic holds its grip on the nation, The Associated Press\u00a0reports. President-elect Joe Biden has nominated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as his first secretary of health and human services. Becerra was a leading advocate for passage of the ACA as California's attorney general, and has defended the law in federal court, including before the Supreme Court.",

The session was streamed on Twitch \u2014 a platform that allows people to broadcast themselves playing video games \u2014  and it became one of the most-watched livestreams in the history of the platform. According to\u00a0CNET, the stream maxed out at 439,000 concurrent views, good for the third-most views ever for a single Twitch stream.

In one of many comical moments, Ocasio-Cortez stated that she did not want to be an imposter, but was assigned that role in the very first game. The stream lasted roughly three and a half hours. The entirety of the stream wasn't taken up by \"Among Us,\" however. It began with Ocasio-Cortez stressing the importance of voting in the upcoming election and urging people to make a plan so that they are prepared to cast their ballot.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden still has a small edge in Florida, but the contest has tightened since our last poll in July, from six points down to two now, amid an ebbing \u2014 if still sizable \u2014 concern about coronavirus, while President Trump has picked up a few more of the state's remaining uncertain voters, rebuilt some of his lead among White voters and leads Joe Biden on handling the economy. (And of course, this is Florida, where races are usually close.)\u00a0 The poll was finished just before the news of the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. So it remains unknown how a court vacancy might shape the presidential race in this and in other states, but we do know voters are already overwhelmingly locked into their choices with strong support, and future polls will see if it impacts voters' already sky-high motivation to turn out, too. In Texas, the race still looks tight as well, though the president maintains his small edge from the summer, adding perhaps a point of breathing room and is up by two points; it was one point in July. The economy continues to be an advantage for the president in Florida, though it's not enough to put him over the top right now. That's partially because the connection between economic outlook and vote is not absolute.\u00a0 While almost all of Mr. Trump's voters think he's helping the economy recover, a quarter of Biden's likely voters concede Mr. Trump's policies are either helping or of neutral impact, and they're still voting for Biden. Those voters overwhelmingly dislike how the president handles himself personally and are more likely to cite the coronavirus than the economy as a major factor for them. Still, the economy does loom large as a top issue across partisan groups, and Mr. Trump does lead Biden among those who say it's a major factor. In both Florida and Texas, more voters say the president would do a better job handling the economy. When we look at how directly connected the candidates' policies are to their pocketbooks, slightly more likely Florida voters, and many more Texas voters, say Mr. Trump's economic policies would help their family's financial situation than feel Biden's would help them. Where Biden has a large policy edge of his own is on health care: a majority of likely voters feel Biden's policies would help people get affordable care, a 21-point gap compared to those who feel Mr. Trump's policies would help them do so. Though coronavirus cases continue to rise, voters in both states feel more positive about efforts to contain the coronavirus now than they did this summer: the percentage who say efforts are going well has ticked up across party lines. Florida seniors' concern about getting coronavirus is related to vote, just as it was in July \u2014 those most concerned, and those for whom it is a top factor are mostly voting for Biden, and Biden is still cutting into Mr. Trump's 2016 margins with Florida seniors. Mr. Trump's current margin with them (9 points) is smaller than his 2016 winning margin was (17 points). More seniors now feel Biden's response to the coronavirus would keep them safe than think the president's response did. But that said, the percentage of seniors very concerned about getting the virus themselves is down nine points from July, even as the issue remains a major factor in their vote. Seniors do say that the president's policies are helping the economy recover, rather than making it worse, and that he would better handle the economy than Biden. Mr. Trump also has the edge among Florida's seniors on who would better handle Social Security and Medicare.\u00a0 The virus is both a health and an economic factor for voters: those who felt the financial fallout from it are more likely to call the outbreak a factor in their vote. And most of them blame the administration for, in their view, making things worse. The study comes after a week of questions about how the president described the virus early on, but partisanship means this hasn't had a lot of impact on the already partisan views of his approach. Republicans largely accept the president's explanation that he downplayed it to not cause a panic, or else that he made it sound as serious as he thought it was, while Democrats say he downplayed it for political reasons. Mr. Trump has also firmed up his already high support within his own party, now at 90% of Florida Republicans (up from 86% this summer). And it furthers the narrative of an election that's very locked-in, as eight in 10 of each candidate's supporters say their support is \"very strong,\" up from this summer, and at levels last seen in Florida closer to the end of the 2016 campaign. And when we re-interviewed some of the voters from July, of the handful who were not sure at the time, more of them have moved to Mr. Trump than to Biden. (More of this small set were conservatives than liberals to begin with.) Biden still leads with Hispanic voters in Florida, if down somewhat \u2014 though not dramatically \u2014 \u00a0at 56% today from 61% this summer. The latter number is right about where Democrats and Hillary Clinton were in 2016, so it's probably a benchmark for Biden. But his relatively better standing from Democrats' 2016 levels among White voters, college-degree voters and seniors also contribute to his narrow statewide lead at the moment. The president's numbers among Hispanics are up, to 36% from 30% \u2014 for context, that's now tracking right about where his support was in 2016, and while still trailing overall, getting back near that mark helps the president bounce back a bit in the state. Looking more closely inside these numbers, we also see differences in expressed turnout: Florida's Hispanic voters are a little less likely to say they'll\u00a0definitely\u00a0vote than White voters are, at 81% to 90%. And those voting for Biden follow that same pattern compared to White voters for Biden: again, likely, but relatively a little\u00a0less\u00a0likely. So in a race where vote choice is so locked in, minor turnout differences could matter a lot.\u00a0 Some have wondered whether the president's criticism of Biden's policies as \"socialism\" might particularly resonate with Hispanic voters in Florida, among others, though views on this seem closely tied to existing partisanship. Relatively more Hispanics see Biden's policies as the right mix of socialism and capitalism (46%) than feel he'd move the country too far toward socialism (39%). And while 42% of Florida's Hispanic voters view socialism at least somewhat negatively, that's not as negative as it is among White voters, 59% of whom view it negatively. In each case, ideology is important. Just as with voters overall, age is a factor here. Older Hispanic voters have a more negative view of socialism and are more inclined to think Biden would move the country more toward socialism than younger Hispanic voters. And there's a difference \u2014 as is usually the case in Florida politics \u2014 between Hispanic voters of Cuban heritage or ancestry, among whom Mr. Trump and Republicans usually do better, and those of Puerto Rican or Central American or other heritage, who favor Biden by large margins. In Texas, where Hispanic voters tell us they are overwhelmingly of Mexican or Chicano descent, support for Biden is both a little more widespread and cuts across generational lines. Six in 10 Hispanic likely voters, young and old, currently support Biden. The president has made back some of his margin among White voters in Florida from our survey this summer. Among White voters, Mr. Trump shows differences from Biden on a series of questions that speak to issues of race. We asked voters whether the Trump and Biden campaigns are paying too much, not enough or the right amount of attention to the needs and concerns of a series of groups, including White people, Black people and Hispanic people.\u00a0 For each of these groups, most White voters say Mr. Trump is giving them about the right amount of attention \u2014 more than say so about Biden. About a third of White voters say the Biden campaign is paying too much attention to the needs and concerns of Black people, in particular. And a majority of them say there has been too much recent attention given to issues of discrimination against Black people. These surveys were conducted on behalf of CBS News by YouGov between September 15-18 2020. They are based on representative samples of 1,220 registered voters in Florida and 1,161 in Texas. Margins of error among registered voters are +/- 3.7 points in Florida and +/- 3.5 points in Texas. Toplines: Florida Texas",

She is also the first South Asian American nominee on a presidential ticket, and only the third woman nominated for vice president. Harris also ran for the Democratic nomination for president, but she dropped out of the race in December and endorsed Biden in March. Harris, 55, is currently the only Black woman serving in the Senate. Kamala Devi Harris was born on October 10, 1964 in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a Tamil breast cancer scientist who emigrated from India in 1960 to pursue a doctorate in endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her father, Donald Harris, emigrated from Jamaica in 1961 to study at UC Berkeley and was a professor at Stanford University. She has a younger sister, Maya, who is now a close political adviser. Gopalan died in 2009 from colon cancer. Harris would often reference her mother while on the campaign trail, attributing quotes from her mother in her speeches. \"My mother would always say, 'Kamala you might be the first to do a lot of things, make sure you aren't the last,'\" Harris frequently said. Harris received her undergraduate degree at Howard University, where she was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Her sorority, known as AKA, has an influential political network. Harris received her law degree University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. Harris' long career as a prosecutor may be a boon for Biden, although critics have raised concerns about her record as a district attorney and California attorney general. After graduating law school in 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California. She also served on the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and later the California Medical Assistance Commission. In 1998, she was hired as an assistant district attorney in San Francisco. Two years later, she joined San Francisco city government in the office of the city attorney, where she ran the Family and Children's Services Division. Harris was elected district attorney in 2003 after a contentious race against Terence Hallinan, who initially recruited her to the district attorney's office. Harris served as San Francisco district attorney until 2010, when she won the race to become the state attorney general. Harris' critics argue that she did not do enough while attorney general to reduce California's prison population or to investigate police shootings. They also point to her record on upholding high sentences for wrongful convictions. However, Harris argues that she was tough against gangs and traffickers, but also promoted some progressive programs like job training for low-level offenders. Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016, after the seat was vacated by retiring Senator Barbara Boxer. As a member of the influential Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, Harris has raised her profile by grilling Trump administration nominees such as Brett Kavanaugh. However, Harris has also worked with Republican senators on legislation, and has been praised Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham as \"smart\" and \"tough.\" She announced she was running for president on January 21, 2019, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and her campaign logo was inspired by Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for president nearly five decades ago. She drew more than 20,000 at her campaign kickoff rally in late January and was viewed as a top-tier contender. She received a boost from her debate attack on Biden on busing, but within days, her on view on the topic became muddled. And Harris changed her positions on Medicare for All during the presidential campaign. Although she was a sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All bill in the Senate in 2017, she diverged from that stance on the campaign trail. Unlike Sanders, Harris did not call for fully eliminating private insurance. Her campaign proposed a system in which people could either purchase government-administrated Medicare plans or buy Medicare plans from private companies. After struggling with fundraising, she ended her presidential campaign in December 2019, before any votes were cast. \"I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign,\" she said. \"And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.\"   Although she has been criticized by some progressives for her time as attorney general, Harris has largely signed onto progressive bills while in the Senate. Along with the Congressional Black Caucus and Senator Cory Booker, she is a co-sponsor of the wide-ranging police reform bill called the \"Justice In Policing Act of 2020\" which passed in the House in June. Harris married Doug Emhoff in 2014. Emhoff has two children from a previous marriage, who call Harris \"Momala.\" Emhoff is an attorney who focuses on entertainment, sports, and complex business, real estate and intellectual property litigation disputes.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows will meet with Senate Republicans and top congressional Democrats on Tuesday to discuss the next phase of coronavirus legislation, amid disagreements between the White House and Congress on how to address the economic fallout from the pandemic. Mnuchin and Meadows will present the administration's proposal for the next round of coronavirus relief at a GOP luncheon, before meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer later in the afternoon. The Republican proposal is still taking shape, but is likely to include another round of direct payments to Americans, billions of dollars for schools and liability protections for businesses. Lawmakers and the White House are hoping to pass a new round of aid by the end of July, before Congress leaves for its August recess. Pelosi told reporters on Tuesday that she was \"hoping for the end of the month.\" Mnuchin said that his aim was to reach an agreement \"by the end of next week.\" House Democrats passed a massive $3 trillion relief bill in May which extended unemployment insurance benefits, among other provisions, but Republicans balked at the price tag and inclusion of measures which they considered irrelevant, like increased funding for state and local elections. The bill also provided federal aid to state and local governments, hazard pay for frontline workers, student debt forgiveness and boosted Medicaid and Medicare. The meeting with Pelosi and Schumer comes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u00a0visited the Oval Office Monday to hash out Republican priorities for the next bill. McConnell has made extending liability protections for businesses, schools and universities a key priority for the next bill, known as \"phase 4.\" \"We don't need an epidemic of lawsuits on the heels of the pandemic we're already struggling with,\" McConnell said at the meeting at the Oval Office. On the Senate floor Tuesday, McConnell said the Republicans' proposal would also \"send $105 billion so that educators have the resources they need to safely reopen,\" noting that the figure exceeds money for a similar fund for schools allocated in the House Democrats' proposal. He added that he supports another round of direct payments to most taxpayers. Mnuchin said Monday that the White House would like the bill to carry a price tag of around $1 trillion. \"The focus is really about kids and jobs and vaccines,\" Mnuchin said. However, Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that he was unimpressed by the plan by Republicans beginning to take shape. \"It appears that the developing Republican proposal is really unlikely to meet the moment,\" Schumer said. Meanwhile, President Trump has continued to press for a payroll tax cut, an idea which has largely been dismissed by Senate Republicans. GOP Senator John Thune told reporters on Monday that he believed a payroll tax cut could be in the \"first draft\" of Republican legislation, but said \"there are a lot of Republicans who don't like it for a lot of different reasons.\" Republican Senator John Cornyn told reporters Monday that he found the idea of a payroll tax cut \"problematic.\" A major sticking point for Republicans is whether and how to extend a provision included in an earlier coronavirus relief bill which provided an additional $600 per week in unemployment insurance. The measure was deemed necessary as millions of Americans have lost their jobs in recent months. However, some Republicans argue that extending the provision, which is set to expire at the end of July, may incentivize unemployed Americans to stay out of work, as they may be making more in unemployment insurance than they did at their old jobs. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans would like to extend the unemployment benefits in a different form to avoid disincentivizing a return to work. Congress passed a flurry of legislation to respond to the pandemic earlier in the spring, including a $2 trillion relief package. However, bipartisan sentiment stalled as the months wore on, even as the number of cases in the U.S. has continued to surge.

            "article_content": "After dropping out of the 2020 race and backing his former rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said he believes the vast majority of his supporters will back Joe Biden in November. Although Sanders acknowledged that \"everybody in American knows\" how different the two are, he stressed the \"choice is pretty clear\" when deciding between Biden and President Donald Trump.\u00a0 Sanders spoke to \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil in his first network TV interview since endorsing Biden to discuss their ideological differences andwhere he expects Biden to adopt a more progressive stance. The Vermont senator was also asked about other concerns some supporters have, including a sexual assault allegation against Biden. His accuser reportedly filed a police report last week, now claiming Biden assaulted her in 1993 when she was working in his Senate office. Published reports indicate her story has changed over the years. Biden's campaign called the allegation \"untrue\" and said the alleged incident \"absolutely did not happen.\" Read a portion of their conversation below: Bernie Sanders: On day one of my campaign, what I said is that, \"If I lose, I will be there to support the Democratic nominee.\" Because it is absolutely imperative that we defeat Donald Trump, who, in my view, is the most dangerous, irresponsible president in the modern history of this country. Tony Dokoupil: That's an argument against Donald Trump. But making the argument for Joe Biden is a different matter. Sanders: To defeat Donald Trump, to me, and make sure that he is not reelected, is enormously important. So if you wanna make the point that Joe Biden's views are not mine, no kidding. I think everybody in America knows that.\u00a0 Dokoupil: \u00a0I made a little list of some of the things that have been central to your campaign, and I'm hoping you let me know which of these you think could be part of a Biden administration. Universal health care is a biggie. Free college for all, canceled college debt, national rent control, a ban on fracking, a wealth tax, marijuana legalization, a 50% reduction in the prison population - these are all things you've campaigned on that have made you popular. Joe Biden doesn't support any of them. Which do you see him moving on? Sanders: \u00a0Well, I think you will see him moving on making public colleges and universities tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000, not where I was. I wanted more\u2026 I think his views on climate change are not my views. But I think he is prepared to invest many hundreds of billions of dollars into sustainable energies like wind and solar and, in the process, create a whole lot of jobs\u2026 I think on health care he is not an advocate of Medicare For All, as I am. But I think he's prepared to come forward with some ideas. Dokoupil: Has he promised you anything? Sanders: Well, we have talked about a number of issues. And you will see those evolving, coming out, I believe, in the next weeks and months. Dokoupil: Joe Biden is gonna need every vote that he can get. How do you improve on your 2016 record to make sure that- Sanders: My 2016 record was a fine record\u2026 in this house right here I got a couple of letters from Hillary Clinton, thanking me for the very strong support that I gave her. I did rally after rally, state after state\u2026 Look, the issue is that the American people are gonna have to make a fundamental decision. I'm gonna play a role in that. Do we come together to defeat somebody who is a pathological liar, somebody who does not believe in the rule of law, somebody who is prepared to give massive tax breaks to billionaires and ignore the needs of working families, or do we elect Joe Biden as president? I think the choice is pretty clear. Dokoupil: I imagine that you will be fundraising for Joe Biden? Sanders: Well, we will decide on what we're gonna do with fundraising. All I would say is that we're gonna do everything that we can to make sure that Donald Trump is not reelected. Dokoupil: How do you campaign in the midst of this pandemic? Should there be conventions? Can you have rallies in the late summer, maybe? Sanders:\u00a0Well, nobody can predict that\u2026 The last thing that we want do is to do anything which gets more people sick and kills more people. That is the last thing that we wanna do\u2026 So I think that whether or not there'll be a convention remains to be seen\u2026 I don't know nor does anybody else, when rallies will be taking place, when candidates will be able to be out on the streets, shaking hands and talking to people face to face. Nobody knows that. Dokoupil: I think it's indisputable that this virus has exposed how medically and financially fragile many sectors of our society are. Sanders: That's right. Dokoupil: In that tragedy, and our response to it, do you think society may reevaluate the need for the policies you've been arguing for, for 30 years now? Sanders: The answer is yes. This pandemic, the economic collapse, has exposed the fragility of our health care system and our economy in terms of protecting working families. That is a lesson that I think many Americans are gonna learn from this. Dokoupil: One of your most important allies, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said recently that she thinks it's legitimate and relevant to talk about sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden. Do you agree? Sanders: I think it's relevant to talk about anything. And I think any woman who feels that she was assaulted has every right in the world to stand up and make her claims. Dokoupil: \u00a0Do you think that should weigh significantly in the mind of- Sanders: \u00a0I think that she has the right to make her claims and get a public hearing, and the public will make their own conclusions about it. I just don't know enough about it to comment further. Dokoupil: \u00a0All right.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that it would be \"irresponsible\" for his loyalists not to support Joe Biden, warning that progressives who \"sit on their hands\" in the months ahead would simply enable President Donald Trump's reelection. And lest there be any question, the 78-year-old Vermont senator confirmed that \"it's probably a very fair assumption\" that he would not run for president again. He added, with a laugh: \"One can't predict the future.\" Sanders, who\u00a0suspended his presidential bid\u00a0last week, spoke at length about\u00a0his decision to endorse Biden,\u00a0his political future and the urgent need to unify the Democratic Party during an interview with The Associated Press. He railed against the Republican president but also offered pointed criticism at his own supporters who have so far resisted his vow to do whatever it takes to help Biden win the presidency. He seemed to distance himself from his campaign's former national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, when asked about her recent statement on social media refusing to endorse Biden. \"She is my former press secretary \u2014 not on the payroll,\" Sanders noted. A spokesman later clarified that all campaign staffers were no longer on the payroll as of Tuesday, though they will get a severance check in May. Sanders said his supporters have a simple choice now that Biden has emerged as the presumptive nominee: \"Do we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive direction? Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president in modern American history to get reelected?\" He continued: \"I believe that it's irresponsible for anybody to say, 'Well, I disagree with Joe Biden \u2014 I disagree with Joe Biden! \u2014 and therefore I'm not going to be involved.'\" Sanders said he would not actively campaign or spend money on advertising in the primary contests that are still on the calendar in the coming months. But he still encouraged Democrats in those states to vote for him, hoping to amass as many delegates as possible for leverage to shape the party platform and the direction of Biden's campaign. He also vowed to continue fighting for progressive priorities such as his signature \"Medicare for All\" as a senator, even though Biden has refused to embrace the government-backed single-payer health care system. \"If people want to vote for me, we'd appreciate it,\" Sanders said of the roughly 20 primary contests that remain where his name will appear on the ballot. He later added, \"I think you're going to see significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign into a more progressive direction on a whole lot of issues.\" Sanders did not outline any specific plans to begin helping Biden in earnest, though he noted that he held dozens of rallies for former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton four years ago and would be at least as active for Biden. In the short term, he said he's essentially \"incarcerated in his home\" because of coronavirus social distancing guidelines and did not know when he would return to the campaign trail. Sanders brushed away questions about why he was willing to back Biden so much sooner than he did Clinton, whom he waited until June to endorse. He said recent conversations with former President Barack Obama, who endorsed Biden on Tuesday, did not influence his decision. It came down to simple math, he said. In 2016, Sanders said he had a mathematical path to the nomination all the way until the California primary, which was held on the last day of voting in June. That simply wasn't the case this year. \"What would be the sense of staying in, of spending a whole lot of money, of attacking the vice president, giving fodder for Trump \u2014 what's the sense of doing that when you can't win?\" he asked. \"I will do everything I can to help elect Joe,\" Sanders continued. \"We had a contentious campaign. We disagree on issues. But my job now is to not only rally my supporters, but to do everything I can to bring the party together to see that (Trump) is not elected president.\" While Sanders is urging his backers to throw their weight behind Biden, some of his top surrogates have so far not endorsed him. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, told the New York Times this week she would support the Democratic presidential nominee in November, but stopped short of endorsing Biden. Ocasio-Cortez also\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday night \"it's legitimate\" to discuss a sexual assault allegation leveled against Biden by Tara Reade, who worked for him when he was a senator. \"If we want, if we again want to have integrity, you can't say, you know \u2014 both believe women, support all of this, until it inconveniences you, until it inconveniences us,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said the allegation against Biden was \"untrue.\"",

            "article_content": "Senator Bernie Sanders criticized President Trump's response to the coronavirus crisis in a speech on Thursday, announcing his plan to address the pandemic shortly after former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled his. Sanders slammed the \"incompetence and recklessness\" of Mr. Trump's response to the crisis, and said the president needed to declare a national emergency. He also urged Congress to move forward \"in a bipartisan matter,\" as Mr. Trump would not do enough to stop the spread. \"We have a major, major crisis and we must act accordingly. Therefore, it is a absolute moral imperative that our response as a government, as a society, as a business community and as individual citizens meet the enormity of this crisis,\" Sanders said. The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday night, announcing new restrictions on travel from Europe in a speech that did little to alleviate concerns about the administration's handling of the virus. Markets plunged again on Thursday, with the Dow dropping by as much as 2,200 points during trading. Speaking before reporters in Burlington, Vermont, a solemn Sanders urged Americans not to feel isolated even if they are self-quarantined or working alone, because \"now is the time for solidarity.\" \"If there ever was a time in the modern history of our country, when we are in this together, this is that moment,\" Sanders said. \"It is an absolute moral imperative that our response as a government, as a society, as a business community and as individual citizens meet the enormity of this crisis.\" He called on the White House to be more transparent about the availability of tests and the spread of the virus. \"The American people deserve transparency, something this administration has fought day after day,\" Sanders said. \"Unfortunately, in this time of international crisis, it is clear to me at least that we have an administration that is largely incompetent.\" Sanders pivoted to advocating for Medicare for All, a key plank of his campaign. He argued that many Americans are not able to afford treatment or testing because the government doesn't provide health care coverage for everyone. He focused much of his speech on the need to care for the most vulnerable members of American society, such as the elderly, unemployed and people requiring food assistance. \"When you are uninsured or underinsured you hesitate about getting the medical care you need because you cannot afford to get that medical care,\" he said. \"The result is that millions of our people cannot afford to go to a doctor let alone pay for a coronavirus test.\" Sanders gave his speech shortly after Biden delivered an address about how he would respond to the coronavirus as president. In his address, Biden revealed an extensive proposal for how he would address the public health aspect of the virus as well as its economic impact. \"No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you this: When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,\" Biden said. The candidates' remarks came days before Sunday's Democratic debate, which has been moved from Arizona to Washington, D.C., because of concerns over the virus. Sanders trails Biden in the delegate count for the Democratic nomination, but vowed to remain in the race earlier this week. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0introduced a legislative package\u00a0with measures including free testing, paid emergency sick leave and increasing funds for food security programs and Medicaid. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday that a planned recess for next week would be canceled in order to address the crisis. Cara Korte contributed reporting.

Aides and allies told CBS News they took solace in the fact that her campaign performed better and lasted longer than many had initially expected. Over the course of the campaign, Klobuchar was quick to admit she did not have the name recognition or financial resources enjoyed by some of her rivals. Besides hitting the trail, her prospects hinged on her performance in the primary debates, which were crucial for introducing herself to a national audience and raising money. Klobuchar positioned herself as a moderate Midwesterner who could unite the party, casting doubt on the feasibility of progressive policy proposals like free college tuition and Medicare for All put forward by Senator Bernie Sanders. She also largely steered clear of criticizing Biden, given the similarity in their views. Armed with her neighborly appeal, Klobuchar bet that a strong finish in the Iowa caucuses would catapult her candidacy into the top tier. She set out to visit all of the state's 99 counties, a feat she accomplished just before the weeks-long Senate impeachment trial trapped her on Capitol Hill. She came in sixth place, signaling that Iowa voters did not agree with her proposition that a Midwest moderate was best suited to win back the heartland. In what would prove to be the high water mark of her bid, Klobuchar managed to bounce back with a\u00a0strong showing at debate in New Hampshire just days before the Granite State's primary. She came in third, ahead of Elizabeth Warren, a surprising finish that allowed her to continue on to Nevada and South Carolina. There were indications earlier Monday that Klobuchar's bid was coming to an end. After an event in Salt Lake City, Utah, the campaign held reporters for over two hours, with the lights turned off and no staff in sight. As late as Monday morning, a senior adviser said they had received no \"official word\" of her exiting the race but declined to elaborate. Multiple aides said they had expected her to remain in the race through Super Tuesday. The senator broke the news to her staff entire shortly after 1 p.m. ET on a conference call from Salt Lake City on Monday, two campaign officials told CBS News. Klobuchar thanked her team for their work on the \"wild ride\" of the campaign, telling staff that she was proud of the operation they built. She also acknowledged that the outcome was not what they wished, but that she felt it was right to consolidate support around Biden. The call lasted around 20 minutes, and Klobuchar and staff members were sad and a bit shell-shocked. One longtime Klobuchar ally said the initial plan to remain in the race through Super Tuesday was becoming untenable as polls showed her coming in behind Sanders in her own state of Minnesota.\u00a0 \"The feeling in the campaign really starting to change last week,\" this person said.

On the day of the New Hampshire primary, he told CBS News he'd heard from voters in those states that they wanted to see a candidate prove he or she can win. \"I think there's going to be a level of clarity as we emerge from New Hampshire, where campaigns like mine that need to go out there and earn support and prove that we have the right message have a whole new chance to do it and are getting a second look from voters who really weren't tuning into us much before,\" Buttigieg said. But the young former mayor of South Bend did not get much of bounce out of the first two states, finishing third in Nevada, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. The Iowa Democratic Party's disastrous handling of its caucuses earlier this month were not helpful to Buttigieg. Its lengthy delay in reporting the results denied Buttigieg a boost after his finish at the top the field. Going into South Carolina, he's polling farther back, with 10% support in CBS News' most recent poll. A Monmouth University poll of likely South Carolina Democratic voters released Thursday showed Buttigieg with even less support, polling at 6%, and receiving just 2% of support among black voters. The same poll showed Joe Biden with 45% support from black voters, followed by Tom Steyer at 17% and Bernie Sanders at 13%. African-American voters are expected to make up 60% of the electorate voting in the primary Saturday. He has been trying to get the message across to black voters that he understands the importance of their support and what they endured to win the very right to vote. \"It is humbling to ask anyone for their vote, but it is particularly so when addressing black voters whose vote was earned through generations of struggle,\" Buttigieg said at a National Action Network breakfast in North Charleston on Wednesday. \"Through blood and sweat and tears just to have access to the ballot box. And a vote that for so many was only won within living memory. And so I'm asking for that vote knowing how hard won it is, knowing it is the vote of those with a great deal at stake.\" On Thursday, Buttigieg continued his courtship of minority leaders, meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Maryland Congressman Anthony Brown, who is one of Buttigieg's national co-chairs, helped organize the meeting, according to a source familiar with the meeting. There have been a few positive signs for Buttigieg. He has received a handful of endorsements from minority officials, including Nevada Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui and South Carolina State Representative J.A. Moore. Jauregui and Moore previously supported supported California Senator Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. He was also endorsed by Jalen Elrod, the vice chair of the Greenville County Democratic Party. The compressed primary schedule may be one of the factors working against Buttigieg, since, anecdotally, it seems some voters here may now be giving him a second look just before the primary. After the debate in Charleston this week, Pamela Rumph, a North Charleston native, told CBS News that she had long supported Joe Biden, but she was disappointed in what he had to say at the National Action Network breakfast Wednesday.\u00a0 \"He just pretty much thanked the people that were here ... Nothing about what his plans or his \u2014 you know \u2014 work for this nation,\" Rumph said. She added, \"That had me, you know, pushing him you know like, 'you got to do it, you got to tell us what you're gonna do, what you're gonna do.' Before, it was a lot about what he did under the Obama administration. Well, the Obama administration is not here any longer, so we need to hear what you're going to do. And I feel like the other candidates really did bring what they were going to do.\" She told CBS News she's undecided now, but if she had to vote today, \"Honestly, never thought it would be, but I think it would be Pete Buttigieg...from (the breakfast) today, what he said, and the passion I felt in what he said.\" In a memo released Tuesday, Buttigieg's campaign detailed his path to the nomination, arguing that his campaign would remain competitive if he's within a 350-delegate margin of Sanders after the Super Tuesday contests. The memo says that the nominating contests on March 10 and March 17 are \"more favorable\" for Buttigieg. A Buttigieg aide told CBS News the strategy heading into Super Tuesday and beyond is focused on hitting the viability threshold for delegates in congressional districts. In an email earlier this week, the campaign set a $13 million fundraising goal leading up to Super Tuesday and says it's over halfway there.\u00a0 \"The key to winning is to minimize Sanders' margins on Super Tuesday and rack up delegates in the following contests as the field winnows,\" the memo says. Ahead of the primaries this weekend and on Tuesday, Buttigieg is barnstorming through North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma and California.\u00a0 Buttigieg has augmented staffing in Super Tuesday states with a large volunteer army in every congressional district in every Super Tuesday state, as well as every congressional district in the March 10th nominating contests, an aide told CBS News. A Buttigieg aide said the campaign has more than 100 staffers in states voting on Super Tuesday, March 10 and March 17. And the campaign announced Thursday that 30,000 volunteers are hosting hundreds of events geared around voter engagement. \u00a0 The campaign announced on Thursday a targeted digital advertising program in Super Tuesday states in which content is user-generated. And the campaign is launching a seven-figure television and digital ad buy for 12 Super-Tuesday states. After the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Buttigieg emerged as a front-runner with his message of unity and his policy platform that has needled between Biden and his more progressive competitors on policies like health care and college affordability. He has sought to differentiate himself from the top contenders who have been in Washington for decades, painting himself as a Washington outsider more prepared than they are to take on the outsider in the White House. Lately, Buttigieg has been drawing sharp contrasts with Sanders, who is leading the field, suggesting that the progressive senator alienates a portion of the electorate. And Buttigieg frequently tells crowds that they do not have to choose a \"revolution\" or the \"status quo.\" He has continued to pitch his health care plan in a television ad in South Carolina. Buttigieg's plan would offer a public option \u2014 \"Medicare for all who want it,\" as he phrases it \u2014 and he often slams Sanders' single-payer government plan, which would eliminate private insurance.

            "article_content": "Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina believes that among the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is the one who poses the \"biggest threat\" to President Trump in November. \"Bernie Sanders brings that outside game in a similar fashion that President Trump did in 2016,\" Scott said in an exclusive interview with \"CBS This Morning\" in Charleston, the site of Tuesday's Democratic debate, co-hosted by CBS News. \"Think about the similarities. In 2016, Republican leadership, Republican wisdom said that there is no way in the world out of the 17 candidates, Donald Trump will be the president. I think it's very similar.\" While Scott said that Sanders is the Democrat who brings the most significant challenge to Mr. Trump among the eight candidates still seeking the party's nomination, Mr. Trump is also a threat to himself. \"If he's on his game as he was at the State of the Union, I don't think there is a candidate in the country that can beat him,\" the South Carolina senator said. \"If there is a second choice other than himself, it would be Bernie Sanders.\" Sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the field of contenders seeking the Democratic nomination following his win in Saturday's Nevada caucuses. The victory builds on his momentum ahead of the primary in South Carolina on Saturday and Super Tuesday on March 3. Scott said Sanders has succeeded in drawing support from voters because of his focus on health care, which is an important issue for African Americans in particular. Sanders's signature health care proposal is Medicare for All. \"Bernie Sanders is doing something in 2020 that he could not do in 2016, which is getting African Americans and Hispanic voters to take a second look at his campaign,\" he said. \"I think perhaps a primary reason is health care. If you look at what stands out the most in his campaign is he is undeniable a socialist, but he is strong and clear and competent on the issues he supports and the issue of health care is a big issue in the African-American community and I think it is the issue for why he ended up with 51% of the Hispanic vote in Nevada.\" While Scott said Sanders could be a danger to Mr. Trump's political future, the senator said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would be the easiest Democrat for the president to beat in November. \"Mike Bloomberg has been so provocative. He has so many challenging story headlines,\" Scott said. \"The narratives for as President Trump calls him 'Little Mike' would be easy for President Trump to take strong advantage.\"\u00a0 Sanders will be on stage in Charleston for Tuesday's debate, which is the last before Saturday's primary and gets underway at 8 p.m. ET. Joining him are Joe Biden, Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Trump's grants of clemency signed Tuesday made headlines for some of the people who received relief, including former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., billionaire financier Michael Milken, former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. But the eye-catching names are just some of the people convicted of federal crimes who benefited from the president's grants of clemency. In all, Mr. Trump issued full pardons to seven individuals and granted commutations to four others. Article II of the Constitution gives the president the power to \"grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.\" While those who receive pardons have records of their convictions wiped clean, commutations override the prison sentences of current inmates and their underlying convictions remain on the books. Here are the other seven people who received executive grants of clemency from Mr. Trump on Tuesday:\u00a0 Ariel Friedler A technology entrepreneur, Friedler pleaded guilty to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization in 2014 and served two months in prison, according to the White House. In the wake of his release, Friedler has promoted veterans issues and helped former prisoners with reentry into society, the White House said. Paul Pogue Pogue owned a construction company in McKinney, Texas, and was found to have underpaid his taxes by 10% over a three-year span, according to the White House.\u00a0 Though he paid a fine and restitution, Pogue pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years of probation in 2010. The White House highlighted Pogue's charity work, including two non-profits he founded. One of the groups builds churches, schools and orphanages in developing countries and the other provides disaster relief. Federal Election Commission records show members of Pogue's family contributed thousands to the Republican National Committee and Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and the RNC, in 2019. David Safavian Safavian served as the top procurement official in President George W. Bush's administration and was sentenced to a year in prison in 2009 for attempting to hide his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He was convicted in 2008 of obstruction and making false statements to investigators. The White House said Safavian is a proponent of criminal justice reform and said his own experience makes him \"uniquely positioned\" to identify and fix problems within the criminal justice system. Angela Stanton An author and television personality, Stanton served a six-month home confinement sentence in 2007 for her role in a stolen vehicle ring. Her first book, \"Life Beyond These Walls,\" tells the stories of incarcerated women. Her second book, \"Life of a Real Housewife,\" chronicles Stanton's life from her early years in Buffalo, New York, to her adult life in Atlanta, where she writes of her encounters with Phaedra Parks of the reality television show \"Real Housewives of Atlanta.\" Stanton is an active supporter of Mr. Trump and proponent of criminal justice reform. Tynice Nichole Hall Hall served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence after allowing her apartment to be used as a stash house for drugs, according to the White House. She was sentenced in 2006 after a federal jury in Lubbock, Texas, convicted her of drug charges, including possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture crack cocaine and possession of firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking crimes. Hall was found with crack cocaine, powder cocaine and two firearms, one of which was believed to have been used in drive-by shootings, according to the Justice Department.\u00a0 While serving her prison sentence, Hall completed job-training programs and apprenticeships, the White House said, and has taught prison educational programs to other inmates. Crystal Munoz Munoz, of West Texas, was convicted more than a decade ago for conspiring to distribute marijuana and has been in prison for the last 12 years, according to the White House. During that time, the mother of two served as a mentor to others and volunteered with a hospice program. Among those advocating for Munoz's release was Alice Marie Johnson, whose case was championed by Kim Kardashian West and was granted clemency by Mr. Trump in 2018. According to The Associated Press, Johnson and Munoz were at the same prison in Fort Worth, Texas, and attended church together. Judith Negron Negron was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2011 for orchestrating a $205 million scheme to defraud Medicare, according to the Justice Department. She owned American Therapeutic Corporation, a mental health care company based in Miami. Negron was ordered to pay $87 million in restitution with the other owners of ATC. The 48-year-old served eight years of her sentence and was described as a \"model inmate\" by her prison warden, the White House said.",

            "article_content": "Washington - An annual congressional report says the U.S. budget deficit is likely to top the symbolic $1 trillion barrier this year despite solid economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office report follows a burst of new spending last year and the repeal in December of several taxes used to help finance the Affordable Care Act. Those have combined to deepen the government's deficit spiral well on into the future, with trillion-dollar deficits likely for as far as the eye can see.  The annual CBO update of the government's economic and fiscal health estimates a $1 trillion deficit for the ongoing fiscal year, which would bring the red ink above $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, when former President Barack Obama capped four consecutive years of $1 trillion-plus budget deficits. But Obama's deficits came as the U.S. economy recovered from the deep recession of 2007-2009. The return of trillion-dollar deficit now comes amid stronger economic growth, with the CBO predicting that the jobless rate nationwide will average below 4 percent through at least 2022. The growth rate is predicted to hit average 2.2 percent this year.  \"The economy's performance makes the large and growing deficit all the more noteworthy,\" said CBO Director Phillip Swagel. \"Changes in fiscal policy must be made to address the budget situation, because our debt is growing on an unsustainable path.\" The government reported a $984 billion deficit for the 2019 budget year. The CBO projects that deficits will rise from 4.6% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2020 to 5.4% in 2030. Because of those accumulating deficits, the agency forecasts that the federal debt held by the public will rise from 81% of GDP this year to 98% in 2030 \u2014 that would be the highest level since 1946 immediately after the heavy government spending that followed World War II. The recent surge in the deficit has followed passage of the 2017 Trump tax bill, which has failed to pay for itself with additional economic growth and revenues as promised by administration figures like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The surge in deficits also follows a final rewrite last summer of a failed 2011 budget deal to increase spending of both defense and domestic programs. Divided government isn't helping the deficit picture as the Democratic-controlled House led the way in repealing $377 billion worth of \"Obamacare\" tax hikes, including a so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was also a driving force in last summer's budget accord, which is scored at adding $1.7 trillion to the deficit over the coming decade. The CBO report landed amid an intensifying presidential campaign in which concerns about the deficit are not really an issue. President Donald Trump has promised to leave Social Security pensions and Medicare benefits off the table as his administration seeks ways to blunt the political impact of the eye-popping deficit figures. The administration's budget is being released next month but is likely to be largely ignored, especially as election-year politics take over.",

            "article_content": "The Clark County Black Caucus said Thursday that it would throw its support behind Bernie Sanders, the latest in a flurry of Nevada endorsements this week as he seeks to shore up support in a key early contest. \"When you look at his platform and his consistency, over the years he has a long history fighting for civil rights and economic justice,\" Yvette Williams, chair of the Clark County Black Caucus, tells CBS News. \"We've interviewed him as well, and he has concrete plans in place that will address many of the inequities, inequalities, and injustices of black America,\" Williams added. Clark County includes Las Vegas and is far and away the most populous county in the state. Racking up supporters in the county is essential for any candidate who hopes to win the Nevada caucuses on February 22nd. The Clark County Black Caucus' endorsement comes as other Nevada groups have rallied to Sanders. On Tuesday, the immigrant rights group Make the Road Action made public its plans to leverage their\u00a0organizing heft in Nevada\u00a0for the Sanders campaign. Meanwhile, the Clark County Education Association, Nevada's largest teachers union, announced Monday that it too would back the Vermont senator.\u00a0 Sanders has invested heavily in Nevada, which votes third after Iowa and New Hampshire. The contest is seen as a crucial test of candidates' support among Hispanic and Asian American voters, as well as the powerful labor unions that dominate Democratic politics in the state.\u00a0 The Nevada caucuses could also be an early barometer for neighboring California, the mammoth Super Tuesday contest where the Sanders campaign has also focused significant resources. Sanders boasts 10 offices and over 100 staffers in Nevada, the most of any candidate the state. And if not for a heart attack that sidelined the senator in Las Vegas\u00a0more than three months ago, he would have recorded the most days publicly campaigning in Nevada\u00a0of any candidate in the race. \"The Clark County Black Caucus represents the diverse coalition we're building in Nevada and I am proud to gain their support,\" Sanders said in a statement.\u00a0 \"Their voice and leadership has brought meaningful change in the lives of the communities they serve, and together, we will fight against a government and political system that have historically oppressed African Americans,\" he added in part. The Clark County Black Caucus, which backed Sanders in 2016,\u00a0had endorsed\u00a0Cory Booker late last year after a vote among its membership of some 400 Nevadans. At the time, the group indicated that Sanders was their second choice.\u00a0 Booker, who suspended his campaign for president on Monday, suggested Tuesday\u00a0in an interview\u00a0with \"CBS This Morning\" that he was not yet ready to endorse a Democratic candidate for president. However, multiple backers of Booker tell CBS News they have already been aggressively courted by other campaigns. Recent polls\u00a0in Nevada show Sanders in a tight race with Joe Biden this year. But while Biden's team is dwarfed by the staff Sanders has amassed, the former vice president has nabbed the support of\u00a0key progressive leaders in the state.\u00a0 The leadership of the influential Nevada Culinary Union\u00a0has remained publicly skeptical\u00a0of Medicare for All, the single-payer healthcare proposal at the heart of the Sanders platform. And\u00a0just this week, a USA Today/Suffolk survey showed Sanders still trailing the Biden among black Nevada caucus-goers. Williams hopes the Clark County Black Caucus can help boost the senator's chances among that demographic and is planning events to support the campaign in its home stretch. Early voting in Nevada kicks off in just a month, on February 15th. \"I have no ill will with Biden. But I just strongly believe that it's time for change for black America. It's time for Bernie Sanders and his policy that's going to provide for an America that's more racially just,\" said Williams. CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "Recreational marijuana use became legal in just one more state, Illinois, with the start of the New Year on Wednesday. More states could follow suit in 2020, with several states set to put recreational marijuana on the ballot. Cannabis is still considered an illegal substance at the federal level.\u00a0 According to an end of the year\u00a0CBS News Poll, support for legal pot hit a new high in 2019, with\u00a065% of U.S. adults\u00a0saying marijuana should be legal. And, for the first time in CBS News polling, a majority of Republicans (56%) favored legal marijuana. While people ages 65 and over continued to be the least likely age group to support marijuana legalization, slightly more of them favored it (49%) than opposed it (45%) in the 2019 poll. \u00a0 The trend has been reflected in state legislatures, albeit piecemeal. Thirty three states have legalized pot in some form, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2012 \u2014 when Colorado and Washington became the first two states to legalize recreational use \u2014 11 states in total have legalized recreational marijuana. Marijuana is currently legal for recreational use in: Alaska, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia. On January, 1, 2020, Illinois became the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana.\u00a0 Democratic Governor JB Pritzker\u00a0granted more than 11,000 pardons for low-level marijuana convictions on Tuesday, ahead of the state's official legalization \u2014 which the Legislature passed in June \u2014 effective on Wednesday. State officials estimate that 116,000 convictions involving 30 grams or less of marijuana, including for possession of the drug, are eligible for pardons under the new law. Illinois is now the second state in the Midwest, following Michigan in 2018, to legalize recreational marijuana sales and use.\u00a0 Several states are expected to vote on recreational marijuana use measures in 2020, while others are preparing similar legislation.\u00a0 Make It Legal Florida, a political committee, is behind a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. Chairman Nick Hansen told CBS Miami in early December that, according to their polling, over 65 percent of Florida voters \"want to have expanded access to cannabis for 21 and over.\" However, that milestone appears to have hit a snag.\u00a0The Miami Herald reports that Make it Legal filed a lawsuit against the state on Tuesday, alleging that a new election law placed restrictions on the ballot initiative process that hampered their ability to collect signatures.\u00a0 As of Tuesday, the state had verified 219,290 signed petitions from Make It Legal \u2014 just 28% of the total signatures needed by the February 1 deadline. Democrats in the state are preparing marijuana legislation, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. House Majority leader Ryan Winkler (D) has been touring the state on the issue in an effort to ready a bill for the state's session in February.\u00a0 The Republican-controlled Senate, however, poses steep odds, as key conservative leaders remain opposed to legalization. Last year proved lackluster for recreational marijuana legislation efforts in the Empire State.\u00a0 A measure to legalize cannabis for adults went up in smoke, despite support from Governor Andrew Cuomo. Legislators did downgrade possession from a misdemeanor to a fine, but people with more than two ounces of the drug on them can still be arrested, according to the New York Police Department.\u00a0 Cuomo has continued to push the issue, hiring Norman Birenbaum, a major force in pro-legalization efforts, to lead the state's cannabis program. \u00a0 The state will vote on legalization of recreational marijuana in November, 2020,\u00a0The Associated Press reports. If the measure passes, New Jersey residents 21 and older will be allowed to use pot recreationally. All sales of cannabis products would be subject to a 6.625% sales tax.\u00a0 Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has called for the \"immediate decriminalization\" of possession of small amounts of marijuana, and hosted a Cannabis Summit in December to educate state leaders on what steps need to be taken to accomplish that goal.\u00a0 \"The system is broken. It's unjust. It's not working and the way to fix it, first of all, is to move and decriminalize possession of small amounts and address those past convictions. But for me, I think we should move to legalize and regulate adult use,\" Herring said, CBS affiliate WTVR reports.\u00a0 He may have the support he needs, as the Commonwealth of Virginia's House and Senate are now controlled by Democrats, who tend to favor marijuana reform.\u00a0 One piece of marijuana legislation that has been filed for the state's 2020 session,\u00a0SB 2, would decriminalize marijuana possession, and would raise the amount needed to be charged with distribution to one ounce versus half-an-ounce, WTVR reports. The bill would also allow people to petition to expunge their convictions. On January 1, 2020, two new laws went into effect in California that clarify tax laws related to the state's legal cannabis industry \u2014 which competes with it's\u00a0long-established illegal cannabis industry.\u00a0 Senate Bill 34 allows licensed cannabis retailers to donate cannabis to low-income patients, and exempts those products from state taxes, CBS affiliate KFMB reports. Assembly Bill 37, allows cannabis businesses to claim deductions and credits available to other legal businesses in the state.\u00a0 Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed those bills into law, but \"begrudgingly\" vetoed another cannabis bill that would have required some health care facilities to allow terminally ill patients to use medical cannabis. In a message explaining his decision, Newsom wrote that the requirement would put patients on Medicaid and Medicare at risk of losing coverage.\u00a0 Since cannabis is still considered an illegal substance at the federal level, most banks are prevented from doing business with marijuana companies. To face this hurdle, lawmakers introduced the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which would protect banks who partner with cannabis businesses, CBS Miami reports.\u00a0 The Act passed the Democratic-led House, but is expected to fail in the Senate, after Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) expressed his strong opposition in December. \"Significant concerns remain that the SAFE Banking Act does not address the high level potency of marijuana, marketing tactics to children, lack of research on marijuana's effects, and the need to prevent bad actors and cartels from using the banks to disguise ill-gotten cash to launder money into the financial system,\" Crapo said in a press release outlining his concerns. The same fate is likely for federal cannabis legalization. In November, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would\u00a0decriminalize marijuana\u00a0at the federal level. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act\u00a0of 2019, or MORE Act, now heads to the full House, where its chances are better in the Democratic-controlled chamber than in the Republican-held Senate, where the bill's future is uncertain.",
