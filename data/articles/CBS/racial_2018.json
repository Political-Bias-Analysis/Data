            "article_content": "White House director of legislative affairs Marc Short is leaving the Trump administration, CBS News' Margaret Brennan confirms. Short will be joining the Miller Center for Public Affairs at the University of Virginia as a senior fellow, effective August 1. \"Marc is widely respected in both parties,\" William Antholis, Miller Center director and CEO, said in a statement Thursday. \"We had the privilege of getting to know Marc through the presidential transition and the Trump administration's first year, and have been impressed by his professionalism, effectiveness, and collegiality.\" Chief of Staff John Kelly said in a statement on Thursday, \"Marc was an integral part of the White House staff.\" Kelly added, \"He and his team helped the President rebuild the military, pass historic tax reform and achieve unprecedented legislative successes. We will miss his profound expertise, commitment to the taxpayers, and leadership.\" The news comes as little surprise to many. Short has been rumored to be departing the White House before the 2018 midterm elections. The Wall Street Journal first reported last month that Short would leave the job as early as this summer, citing \"diminishing returns\" of pushing the president's agenda to Republican members on Capitol Hill.  The Journal, citing people familiar with conversations, said Short had informed Kelly before the White House delegation went to Singapore for the North Korea\u00a0summit in June that he would be leaving sometime soon.\u00a0 When asked about any possible plan in motion to replace Short, as well as to replace White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah after sources told CBS News the two were planning their departures, Sanders told reporters, \"I don't know that there's a need to replace them.\" The Journal reported that a possible contender to succeed Short would be Shahira Knight, deputy director of the National Economic Council, a department that has seen its own shift in staffing after\u00a0Larry Kudlow\u00a0replaced Gary Cohn as NEC director after Cohn\u00a0stepped down in March. The White House confirmed that Knight would be taking Short's place as Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs. \u00a0 \"She brings over two decades of legislative and policy experience to the role.\u00a0 Previously, Ms. Knight served as Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council,\" the White House said in a statement.\u00a0 Short's move to leave the Trump White House is the latest staff departure, and it comes days after EPA chief Scott Pruitt resigned from his position last week.\u00a0 Short previously served as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence and was president of Freedom Partners, the Koch brothers' chamber of commerce-styled group. Short said in a statement the he will be \"forever indebted to President Trump and Vice President Pence for the opportunity to join their campaign in 2016 and be part of an Administration that has worked with Congress to pass the largest tax relief in American history, to rebuild our military with the largest funding increases since the Reagan years, and to confirm more appeals court judges than any Administration in its first two years.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "A West Wing aide's morbid remark about gravely ill Sen. John McCain has not yielded widespread White House soul-searching. Instead, it has led to a push to fire those responsible for leaking that story and others that have bedeviled President Trump's administration. Nearly a week after Kelly Sadler dismissed McCain's opinion on Trump's CIA nominee during a closed-door meeting by saying \"he's dying anyway,\" a torrent of criticism has rained down on the White House. The administration has repeatedly declined to publicly apologize, but the fallout has shaken the West Wing, where the focus remains on who leaked to the media. Mr. Trump is demanding that whoever let the story go public be fired, according to a White House official and an outside Trump adviser. Neither was authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Leaks have long been a problem for Mr. Trump's White House, but this one has drawn particular scrutiny within the building because of the staying power of the damaging story. Several senior officials, including chief of staff John Kelly and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, have called closed-door meetings to warn junior staffers that a shake-up could be in the offing. The mood has grown increasingly tense. \"It's an honor and a privilege to work for the president and to be part of his administration. And anybody who betrays that I think is a total and complete coward and they should be fired,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders this week. \"We've fired people over leaking before.\" Rumors have been circulating over who is responsible for the leak, and chatter about aides looking for the exits has picked up, though previous declarations of crackdowns did not yield shake-ups or end the leaks. Mr. Trump has claimed the reports of leaking are exaggerated, but he also suggested in a provocative tweet this week that those who do so are \"traitors.\" National security adviser John Bolton said that some leakers were \"national security risks\" and that Kelly was organizing an effort to cut them down. \"The president has to have advisers around him who can have open, candid discussions and then not read about him the next day in the newspapers or watch them on television,\" Bolton told Fox News Radio. Conway said Thursday that she knew the identity of some of the leakers but did not say what repercussions might be forthcoming. She told Fox News that there is \"99.8 percent of the information some of us know in this place that never gets leaked.\" Leaks are nothing new to any White House, but they have been far more pervasive in the Trump administration. In the president's eyes, the number of unflattering leaks has been evidence that a \"deep state\" of career officials scattered throughout the government is conspiring against him. But Mr. Trump \u2014 who has been known to leak himself \u2014 has had a love-hate relationship with the practice long before he came to Washington. \"When I worked for Mr. Trump, I worked under the maxim that he liked leaks. I never cleared them ahead of time, but I would tell him later so he'd have deniability,\" said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign official. \"Sometimes he loved them, sometimes he screamed about them. But he never told me to stop. He loves the media, loves being talked about, he loves how a leak gets his name in the news.\" Campaign infighting and West Wing rivalries have led to nasty leaks about fellow staffers, while other revelations to the press appeared to be motivated by attempts to influence \u2014 or undermine \u2014 the president. Sanders called a heated communications staff meeting last week to discuss the Sadler incident, during which Sadler received the support of several staffers, including Mercedes Schlapp, the White House's director of strategic communication. Schlapp has been a candidate to become communications director, a post that has been open since the resignation of Hope Hicks, a departure that some White House staffers believe has further eroded morale. Schlapp's husband, Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, says a senior staff must have honest conversations without worrying that the information is going to be made public. Leaks, he said, \"can be used as a weapon to take out people you don't like, rivals on the staff. And at the end, it really destroys the ability of the president to push hard on his agenda because everything is distracted.\" Ari Fleischer, press secretary for President George W. Bush, said the current tone has been set by Mr. Trump, both on leaks and the lack of apologies. \"If the president created an inclusive environment where everyone was sure they'd be heard, there would be few leaks. But if the president creates an environment where the staff will infight and wrestle, the staff will leak,\" Fleischer said. \"And if the White House apologized now, they'd immediately be asked about every other time they haven't apologized.\" A number of White House aides believe it was a mistake not to publicly apologize to McCain and believe doing so would have cut into the shelf-life of a story that, despite Stormy Daniels and the Russia investigation, has managed to carve out a consistent share of cable news coverage. But they privately acknowledge that it would have unleashed the president's wrath. Mr. Trump has long prided himself on never apologizing, believing it shows weakness, and has often displayed enmity for McCain. During the election campaign, he declared that McCain, who was a prisoner of war for more than five years, was not a war hero, and he has publicly and privately blamed the Arizona senator, who is battling cancer, for submarining the Republican health care bill last year. Mr. Trump's White House has followed that lead, avoiding apologies while defending some of Mr. Trump's most incendiary remarks like his comments about Mexican immigrants. One time a White House staffer did acknowledge a mistake was in February, when deputy press secretary Raj Shah admitted that \"we all could have done better\" when discussing the White House's handling of Rob Porter, the staff secretary who was accused of abusing two ex-wives. Mr. Trump, who watched the briefing that day from his private dining room just off the Oval Office, was incensed by the remark and later chewed out Shah for making it, according to two White House officials. ___ Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It was one year ago Thursday when Robert Mueller, the former FBI director, was appointed as special counsel\u00a0to take over the Justice Department's investigation into possible coordination between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The 12 months since have yielded a flurry of criminal indictments and guilty pleas, tense court appearances, angry tweets from the president and speculation over what the ever-taciturn Mueller already knows and what he'll investigate next. President Trump himself commemorated the occasion on Twitter Thursday morning, tweeting \"Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in American history ...\" Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money! Hundreds of pages of court filings, and public statements from witnesses, have to an extent pulled back the curtain on an extraordinarily secretive investigation. But much remains hidden from view. A look at the last year and what may lie ahead: There's no doubt Mueller's investigation is far reaching, but at its core, prosecutors have remained focused on two central questions: Did the Trump campaign collude with the Kremlin to tip the 2016 presidential election in the Republican candidate's favor? And has President Donald Trump tried to obstruct the investigation since taking office through actions including firing FBI Director James Comey and badgering Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his recusal from the Russia probe? A veritable who's who of current and former White House officials, as well as foreign businessmen and top campaign and transition staffers. Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was questioned last fall about former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr. Trump's White House counsel, Don McGahn, has been in to see Mueller's team, as have former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former communications director Hope Hicks, former chief strategist Steve Bannon, California real estate developer and longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack \u2014 and dozens of other witnesses. In a reflection of the wide-angle nature of the investigation, and its ongoing examination of foreign influence on the Trump administration, a grand jury in Washington has heard from a Lebanese-American businessman who joined a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower involving top Trump aides and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. A Russian American lobbyist who attended a June 2016 meeting at which Trump's eldest son expected to receive damaging information about his father's opponent, Hillary Clinton, also has provided testimony. A total of 19 people and three Russian companies have either been indicted or pleaded guilty to criminal charges. Among those charged are Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is awaiting trial in Virginia and the District of Columbia, and Flynn, who pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI and has been cooperating with Mueller's investigation. Other cooperators include deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and former campaign foreign policy adviser\u00a0George Papadopoulos. Alex van der Zwaan, a\u00a0Dutch lawyer who lied to the FBI is serving a 30-day prison sentence for lying to special counsel prosecutors and the FBI, and a California man who unwittingly sold bank accounts to Russians has also pleaded guilty. The single largest criminal case involves 13 Russians and three Russian companies, accused of conspiring together to fund a hidden but effective social media campaign to exploit American divisions on race and other hot-button topics as well as favor Trump over Clinton. The criminal cases so far have not resolved the core question of Trump-Russia collusion, but they have revealed a determination by Russians to put Trump in office, and they've exposed the sometimes-shadowy foreign entanglements maintained by Trump aides before, during and after the campaign. They've also underscored how Trump associates were aware of Russian outreach efforts during the campaign and how at least one believed Russia to be in possession of compromising information on Clinton. An indictment against Manafort and Gates, for instance, accused them of working as foreign agents for Ukrainian interests and funneling millions of dollars from the work into offshore accounts used to fund lavish lifestyles. Charging documents in Papadopoulos's case make clear that during the presidential campaign he was told by a professor who claimed powerful connections to the Kremlin that Russia had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. And Flynn's guilty plea revealed how, contrary to public assertions from the White House, the incoming national security adviser did indeed discuss sanctions with the then-Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the transition period. The biggest unresolved question is whether Mr. Trump will sit for an interview with Mueller -- and what will happen if he does not. Mr. Trump at times has expressed a desire to be questioned by the special counsel team, though his mood toward the investigators soured considerably following an April 9 raid targeting his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen -- an offshoot investigation in New York City that poses its own legal peril for the president. Mueller has dozens of questions he'd like to put before the president, largely focused on obstruction but also on the underpinning issue of possible campaign collusion. The legal team initially said it hoped to make a decision on an interview by May 17, the one-year mark, but lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CBS News he hopes to have a final decision about whether Mr. Trump will sit for an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller before the president heads to Singapore for the highly anticipated\u00a0North Korea summit in mid-June. According to Giuliani, the president has been so consumed with Iran and North Korea that his new lawyers were barely able to get any time last with him last week to discuss the negotiation with the special counsel or to engage in any preparation. The president's personal attorney recently told CBS News correspondent Paula Reid that Giuliani suggested to Mueller a sitting president cannot be indicted, and Mueller expressed his uncertainty over that claim. But Mueller's assistant subsequently followed up with Giuliani and told him the special counsel is bound by a Department of Justice memo saying a sitting president cannot be indicted, according to Giuliani. If Mr. Trump does say yes, look for his legal team to try to aggressively narrow the scope of questioning and limit the time of any sit-down. If he says no, Mueller may take the extraordinary step of seeking a grand jury subpoena to force his testimony, though such a move could prolong the investigation by many months and may end with a fight before the U.S. Supreme Court. Giuliani has\u00a0previously asserted that the president doesn't have to comply with such a subpoena\u00a0from the special counsel's office and instead \"can assert the same privileges other presidents have.\" The Washington Post first reported that\u00a0Mueller had told the president's lawyers in March that Mr. Trump might be subpoenaed\u00a0if he does not agree to answer investigators' questions. Looking ahead, the special counsel's office is expected to last well into next year and will stay open through the end of the Manafort case and/or any other case it brings.\u00a0 The first prosecution of Manafort will start in July and the second trial will be held in September. \u00a0The second trial is expected to last at least three weeks.\u00a0 After a verdict the proceedings are unlikely to wrap-up before the end of the year. The end game is unclear. Mueller will be expected to report his findings to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department official who appointed him. A report of his conclusions may then be passed onto Congress, but it's not clear when or how much of Mueller's work will be revealed to the public. If Mueller decides charges against a sitting president are supported by evidence, it will be up to Rosenstein to decide whether to refer the matter to congress or do nothing and stick the recommendation in a drawer. Rosenstein has publicly said he does not believe a sitting President can be indicted. Giuliani says Mueller believes the same, but even if Mueller wants to indict, Rosenstein is his boss and approves all charges. \u00a0Depending on the outcome, it is possible Congress could use the findings to start impeachment proceedings -- especially if Democrats take control in the midterm elections. Justice Department legal opinions from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment and that criminal charges would undermine the ability of the commander in chief to do the job. Mueller would presumably be bound by that conclusion. Absolutely nothing. Mueller, never known at the FBI as especially gregarious or verbose, has not spoken publicly about his work since his appointment, nor is he likely to. The only speaking his attorneys have done has been in court and through detailed charging documents. It's unclear how much longer the investigation will last, but it's more likely than not that Mueller and his team have a sense of where they're taking it. Comey, who succeeded Mueller as FBI director and whose firing led to his appointment as special counsel, has said investigators who spend a year digging into something are \"incompetent\" if they don't know where their case is heading.

            "article_content": "President Trump's legal team waived attorney-client privilege on the recording longtime Trump attorney Michael Cohen made, a source with knowledge confirms to CBS News.\u00a0Cohen secretly recorded a conversation he had with Mr. Trump shortly before the 2016 presidential election in which they discussed a possible payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who alleges she had an affair with Mr. Trump in 2006.\u00a0 The recording was seized in the FBI raids on Cohen's home and office in April, as a part of the federal investigation into Cohen's business dealings.\u00a0 The source with knowledge tells CBS News' Sara Cook that the special master in Cohen's case, Barbara Jones, determined the tape fell under attorney-client privilege, but Mr. Trump waived that privilege. The source with knowledge also said Cohen's recording of the tape was not illegal, as New York is a one-party consent state for recordings.\u00a0 Mr. Trump complained on Twitter Saturday morning that an attorney recording a client's conversation is \"inconceivable.\" It is unclear why Mr. Trump's legal team would waive privilege, and the source with knowledge called doing so a \"foolish strategy.\"\u00a0 \"First, a lawyer taping a client is not illegal,\" said the source, adding that New York law only requires one party to consent for a recording.\u00a0 \"Taping a conversation is the functional equivalent of retaining notes,\" the source added. \"Second, the tape, as well as a lawyer's notes, are privileged and non-public. It is the client who owns the privilege and not the lawyer. In this specific instance, it was Trump who waived the privilege after Special Master Jones ruled the tape was privileged. Team Trump actually contacted the Judge and waived the privilege, thus, permitting Rudy (Giuliani) the ability to release his version of the tape's content. It is ironic that Trump would complain about a privileged tape that would not have been released and then chooses to make it public himself. Very foolish strategy by team Trump.\" Mr. Trump, via a White House statement in February, denied having an affair with McDougal.\u00a0 The news of the recording comes at a time when Cohen has been under considerable pressure to cooperate with federal investigators in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling and any ties to Trump associates. Last month, Mr. Trump said Cohen is no longer his attorney. Sara Cook contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Vice President Mike Pence that aired Sunday, September 9, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: In the past, respectfully, I mean, you suffered, when you were lied to by Michael Flynn. I mean he was fired for lying to you. Do you believe the denials this time?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I do because I know the men and women who serve with us in this cabinet. But I also do because whoever wrote that editorial, and the narrative that comes out of some other writings recently, just doesn't know what really happens in this White House. I've seen this president in action. Is he demanding? Yes. Is he a strong leader who expects things done yesterday? Yes. But for someone to say that that what we've accomplished in the last 18 months is in spite of this president's leadership, this just reflects an ignorance about President Trump and about our administration.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the claims made in the op-ed is that there had been discussion of invoking the 25th Amendment to even remove the president from office. Have you ever been part of a conversation about that?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: No. Never. And why would we be, Margaret? I mean, the truth of the matter is over the last eight years, despite what we heard from President Obama on Friday, I mean this country was struggling. I mean it was the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression because having inherited a recession, President Obama's answer was to raise taxes, to double the national debt, to increase regulation, to pass Obamacare into law, to stifle American energy.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But he says the economic upswing began on his watch.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I know he said that but I don't think too many Americans noticed it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that there are other writings that- that you also think are inaccurate here. Bob Woodward had this book that just is about to come out describing in detail a number of incidents inside the White House where he basically describes people around the president trying to protect the country from him. What is it that you think is inaccurate in his description?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, the only thing that's wrong about that narrative is everything. Because it shows- it shows a complete misunderstanding of how this White House works, and what- what President Trump provides for this country every day is strong and decisive leadership in the Oval Office. The narrative that I've picked up, in- in not only this book but the opinion editorials, suggests that- that- that things are happening in spite of the president's leadership, and nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, our founders envisioned all executive power being vested in the president of the United States, and the American people should know all the progress that we're making is a result of the fact that President Trump engages in debate, he gets all of the facts and he's not afraid to make a decision--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Woodward says he spoke--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --and move forward.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to 100 people. He has recordings. He has notes to back up these firsthand accounts. One of the instances was he said that the president was stopped from tweeting about withdrawing U.S. personnel from South Korea because North Korea would view it as an act of war. These are specific instances. You're saying they didn't happen?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: What that suggests, and- and what I get from other examples and narratives is, is that- that- that people are managing the president, when in fact what happens in the White House every day, Margaret, is the president invites opinions. He tends to put people around the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office who have diverse views. And- and- and he invites a vigorous debate over what policies ought to be embraced. Then he makes a decision and we go forward. Whether it's foreign policy, domestic policy, or whether it's legislation on Capitol Hill--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think he respects those advisors?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --that's exactly the kind of leadership the American people wanted when they elected President Donald Trump.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN Some of the instances here are really specific. The president has publicly mocked Jeff Sessions, but in this book, these are specific instances of disregarding the commerce secretary to his face, insulting other cabinet officials. Do you dispute all of these examples?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I would tell you I know this president has great respect for the men and women who serve in this cabinet. And these- these accounts are very foreign to me. And- and I'm just not aware of instances where they've occurred and or where they would occur. But look I- I want to stipulate that working in the White House is not for everybody. I mean this president is tough. He's demanding. He wants things yesterday. And I think it's one of the reasons why we've accomplished so much in such a short period of time. I mean the truth is I think President Donald Trump is the most accomplished president of my lifetime and I think already one of the most successful presidents in American history--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --in our first two years.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --people should be fired because of this?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I- I truly believe that- that whoever penned this opinion editorial should do the honorable thing and resign. I mean the truth of the matter is that the opinions that they expressed are not only deceitful and false but they're also un-American and they represent an assault on our democracy.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has made clear though that he doesn't agree with his attorney general on a number of things. And earlier this week he suggested that Jeff Sessions should not have brought charges against two Republican lawmakers who were running for re-election because he thought it could jeopardize the party's control of Congress. I mean this suggests that the Justice Department should be taking politics and making it a priority. Do you agree with that?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I think there are guidelines in the Department of Justice about not making decisions or taking action that may impact elections, and that's longstanding through numerous administrations. But look I think one of the things the American people--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --So Jeff Sessions, you agree, was correct in his actions?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: What I want to say, Margaret, is what the American people appreciate is this president says what he thinks. He lets people know what he feels about things, but and- and- and really in a very real sense, what you see is what you get with President Donald Trump. And I think that's the reason why he's made the connection that he's made with people all across this country because--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --But- but with something like that--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --Washington DC- while Washington DC focuses on--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --when it has to do with a legal matter--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --these various controversies--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --people argue that that's dangerous--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --he's focused on their interests.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --That may be frank. That may be what he thinks, but that there's a danger to saying things like that because it suggests that rule of law should be sublimated to politics.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: No. This is a president who has strongly affirmed our commitment to the rule of law and to the- to our justice system. I think you need look no further than the- than the hearings this week with Judge Kavanaugh to hear his strong affirmation of an independent judiciary. This president has reflected that throughout the policies of this administration. But- but look he's always going to be transparent about how he feels about things. And, as I said, there's longstanding Department of Justice guidelines that have to do with making sure that actions are not taken that- that- that inadvertently impact the electoral process. But all of that being said, I really do believe the president's candor is one of the reasons why the American people appreciate him.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What are your plans to sit for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: You know we've fully cooperated over the last year--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Has he asked for an interview with you yet?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --with the Mueller investigation. He has not. Although we've provided any and all information and we'll continue to do that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'd be willing to sit with him if he were to ask?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I would. I would be more than willing to continue to provide any and all support in that. And we have outside counsel that will advise me accordingly. But I just have to tell you Margaret, it's just not been my focus and it's not the president's focus. I mean the reason why we're making the progress that we're making all across this country, rebuilding our military, restoring America's strength in the world, seeing the opportunity for peace emerge on the Korean Peninsula. I mean- we're hearing- we're expecting a letter as we speak from Kim Jong un communicating again as he did last week his- his reaffirmation of his commitment to denuclearization. No more nuclear tests. No more missile tests. Our hostages are home. And I had the privilege of being there when the remains of a 55 fallen Americans in the Korean War were returned to American soil--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think the diplomacy is stalled--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --That's all the result of the president's leadership.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --even though the secretary of state called off his visit?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I- I actually believe that when the president canceled the meeting a week ago because he wasn't seeing enough progress in denuclearization, that that may well have resulted in what Kim Jong un communicated to a South Korean envoy just last week, and we're anticipating the letter from Kim Jong un and all the while our sanctions remain in place.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And do you think you need to cast the deciding vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, we hope not. I think the- I think what the American people--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not sure where you are on vote count yet?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: We'll see where we are. But I have to tell you that despite the embarrassing display by many Senate Democrats in the Judiciary Committee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh showed the intellect, the temperament, the judicial philosophy that- that I believe should generate broad-based support in the United States Senate. And we have every confidence that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will very soon be Justice Brett Kavanaugh and take a seat on the Supreme Court.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Margaret. One of the challenges of television interviews is going back and clarifying your words after the cameras have been turned off. We experienced that in our interview with the vice president Saturday. Here's what we asked at the beginning of the interview about who wrote the anonymous op-ed: MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think anyone on your staff -- since they're calling themselves the Trump appointee -- had anything to do with this? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I just -- I wouldn't know. And I would -- I really would hope not. And I was I was heartened to see so many of our colleagues make it very clear that they weren't involved in this in any way. Look, I can tell you serving alongside this president is is an incredible privilege for me and I know it is for for every member of our Cabinet and all the senior personnel in our administration. I mean this is a this is a president who literally gets up every day and works to keep the promises that we made to the American people and when you look at the record of success over the last 18 months it's truly been remarkable. After the interview, the vice president told us he had misunderstood the question and asked if he could clarify.\u00a0 So we turned the cameras back on.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Vice President, I asked you earlier if anyone on your staff wrote this op-ed. Have you asked your staff? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Oh, well, I thought you were speaking about the administration staff. Let me be very clear, I'm 100 percent confident that no one on the vice president's staff was involved in this anonymous editorial. I know my people Margaret. They get up every day and are dedicated, just as much as I am, to advancing the president's agenda and supporting everything the President Trump is doing for the people of this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you asked them? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well you know, honestly, I don't have to ask them because I know them. I know their character. I know their dedication and I am absolutely confident that no one on the vice president's staff had anything to do with this. But that being said, you know, whoever this was they should do the honorable thing and resign.",

            "article_content": "By Nicole Sganga, Ed O'Keefe and Caitlin Conant President Trump is enjoying a slight bump in his approval ratings. The economy continues to grow and unemployment rates are at their lowest levels in more than a decade. The president is making bold moves in foreign policy \u2013 ripping up the Iran nuclear deal while engaging North Korea in denuclearization talks and moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem \u2013 and polling suggests most Americans don't seem to mind. So what are Democrats to do? The midterm elections are less than six months away, and the party remains focused on retaking at least one chamber of Congress and eating into the GOP's dominance in state capitals. Several Democrats are also eyeing the 2020 presidential elections and making early moves to position themselves for what's expected to be a crowded race. On Tuesday, at least 10 potential presidential candidates \u2013 many of whom face reelection to their day jobs before then \u2013 gathered in Washington for the annual Center for American Progress Ideas Conference, a live laboratory to test-run ideas and politically palatable soundbites. The ideological divide that defined the 2016 primary between the more moderate Hillary Clinton and progressive Bernie Sanders still haunts the party, as it attempts to articulate what it stands for before the 2018 midterm elections -- and before 2020. While some midterm candidates have been calling for Mr. Trump's impeachment, that was not the case today.\u00a0 Rather than focusing on anti-Trump rhetoric, most of the speakers pitched policy proposals to move the party forward. Their policy prescriptions were far from uniform, though. While all of the potential 2020 hopefuls embraced progressive values, they each hold a different opinion of what embodies those values right now. To that end, they highlighted a variety of topics, including women's rights, pot legalization, economic justice and climate change. We attended the conference, and here's a breakdown of what we heard and observed. Last year, on the heels of his 2016 presidential bid, Sanders was noticeably missing from the Center for American Progress' annual ritual. The outspoken Vermont senator appeared Tuesday to address criminal justice, managing to tout his stalwart issues of corporate greed, economic inequality and the next generation. Though Sanders never strays too far from the political spotlight, his address evoked memories of his campaign. This time, though, his words were addressed to President Trump, not to the former business magnate and Republican candidate. \"Together \u2013 black, whites, Latino, Native American, Asian American, women and men, gay and straight, young and old - we must not allow Donald Trump or anyone else to divide us up,\" Sanders demanded. \"Because when we stand together, as one people, united, fighting for a progressive agenda there is nothing, nothing, nothing that we cannot accomplish.\" Sander's former campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Wednesday on MSNBC that Sanders may consider a presidential reboot run, \"if he believes he's the best person to do that.\" The senator has spent recent days stumping in the South and testing out his message to predominantly black audiences. With 2020 looming, the former presidential candidate wasted no time cautioning voters of the high stakes in future elections \u2013 and the price of not casting a ballot. \"We must end the disgrace of having one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth,\" he warned. \"Please do not forget because if you do, we will pay the price for that. Closing out Tuesday's conference, Warren did not sugarcoat her party's midterm prospects. \"The 2018 election will be a massive uphill climb,\" the Massachusetts lawmaker stated. \"And while we'd rather talk about great ideas, we can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican party have done to our democracy. We can't ignore it, and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\" And while many of today's featured speakers avoided rehashing the previous presidential election, Warren underlined Clinton's popular vote total. \"In 2016, nearly 3 million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump, but Trump took the presidency,\" Warren said. \"That is not exactly the sign of a healthy democracy. Democracy hangs on the idea that whoever gets the most votes wins. That's the central starting point and it's worth repeating every single day.\" Up for re-election this year, the Massachusetts lawmaker announced that she has donated $175,000 to organizations aimed at redrawing gerrymandered congressional districts. Though the senior senator's millions in campaign funds, town hall tour and \"nevertheless, she persisted\" rallying cry have all boosted her national profile in the age of Trump, Warren has stated as recently as March that she has no interest in tossing her hat in the presidential ring. Still, her closing pitch had a certain stump-speech familiarity as she reflected on her career: \"I am here today, the daughter of a janitor who got to be a public-school teacher, a lawyer and a United States Senator because America invested in kids like me.\" Alabama's own recently elected Democratic senator took the stage in a discussion with Slate's Jamelle Bouie. The southern lawmaker joked he had no doubts about the motivation behind his invitation. \"I realize I am the closest thing to a unicorn this country has,\" Jones quipped. Jones attributes to his success to sticking to \"the kitchen table issues\" voters care about. He recollected telling campaign staffers during his Senate run, if they ever tried pitching a campaign ad featuring guns or churches, \"I'm going to fire your ass.\" It's a strategy he feels can be replicated in 2018, with proper measure and discipline on the part of the candidate. On towing the line between his Democratic values and this Republican administration, Jones insisted he will not be a \"rubber stamp for the opposition.\" He added, \"I am not going to be a knee jerk, and say, 'No, no, no, this is Donald Trump, and I won't support it.'\" In evaluating cabinet nominees, the junior senator notes, that the needle \"is always in favor of the president,\" but he will do an independent review. \u00a0 For example, before announcing his endorsement of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Jones says he invited the then-CIA Director into his office. \"I had serious concerns about his political statements involving Muslims and the gay community, which in fact was personally disturbing to me and my family.\" Ultimately, Jones gave him his support. \"I felt he was straight with me.\" The alternative \u2013 a State Department with no appointed leader \u2013 was not an option. \"Tillerson was a disaster,\" he interjected. With an eye on 2020, the New Jersey firebrand paced the stage to discuss economic justice, sharing anecdotes about his corner bodega and reciting poet Langston Hughes' \"Let America Be America\" from memory. Booker is no stranger to the national spotlight, and while he's pushed off the prospect of a potential presidential bid until after midterms, the former Newark mayor is looking \u2013 and sounding\u2014more and more like a candidate. \u00a0 \"You want to see the truth of a country,\" Booker challenged the audience. \"Go to the prisons in the nation.\" He repeatedly argued marijuana is already legal among privileged populations in the United States. \"I watched growing up in an affluent neighborhood, how my friends did the same knucklehead stuff that teenagers do in every type of community,\" Booker said. \"Weed is legal in America if you are privileged, if you're at Stanford,\" the Stanford alumnus noted. \"But in my community, you see who we put in prison.\" \"While nations were building their infrastructure, we were building prisons,\" Booker continued, drawing a straight line from construction of prisons to increased poverty rates, appealing to the ethics of attendees. \"This moral country, the United States, who do we imprison,\" Booker asked, working up a sweat. \"We imprison overwhelmingly the poor.\" The 37-year old representative from Massachusetts \u2013 the youngest elected official to appear today \u2013 took the stage with one message. \"Healthcare is a right,\" he told audience members in a pitch that also spoke to much of America's approximately 27 million uninsured. Kennedy was quick to draw a political line between Democrats and Republicans. \"The Trump administration has made his vision exceedingly clear,\" he stated. \"Healthcare is a privilege to be earned, is a luxury to be bought and a commodity to afford.\" The former prosecutor recounted stories of his interactions with clients and constituents alike, highlighting what he called the shame overshadowing America's treatment of the mentally ill. \"The three largest institutions providing psychiatric care are jails,\" Kennedy said. With echoes of Sanders' and Booker's remarks on inequality, Kennedy's mention of cracks within the American criminal justice system underlined Tuesday's most consistent theme among speakers.\u00a0 Speculation about the future prospects of the great-nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Ted Kennedy heightened after the Massachusetts Congressman delivered the Democratic response to Mr. Trump's State of the Union address in January. But while youth is a coveted commodity in a greying Democratic Party, the young Kennedy has repeatedly shot down questions about a 2020 bid. New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio - the only current Mayor to speak at today's conference-touted his new 30-day mission to cut back on arrests for marijuana possession. \"We don't tolerate them. We don't accept them,\" the Mayor told CBS News in an interview following his remarks. \"Unnecessary arrests are not helping grow faith in the NYPD and are not a good use of officer time,\" de Blasio added, noting that his administration felt they needed to work their way up to this kind of reform. The mayor's comments mark a departure from his former defense of marijuana arrest tactics and trail a New York Times report detailing racial disparities on marijuana enforcement.\u00a0 From behind the podium, the Mayor also applauded a long list of grassroots efforts sweeping the country, tallying the movements that have shaped national conversations over the past year: \"What the teachers have done in West Virginia, and Oklahoma, and Arizona, and Kentucky, what the students in Parkland, Florida have done, what the Me Too movement has done, what the Black Lives Matter movement has done, the elections in Virginia for the House of delegates, the elections in Alabama for U.S. Senate. This all happened simultaneously.\"\u00a0 In a time often defined by the Trump agenda and those who oppose it, the progressive Democrat actively rejects resistance talking points. \"We tried that in 2016. It was all about what's wrong with Donald Trump,\" de Blasio shrugged. \"That's not speaking to people's everyday lives.\"\u00a0 Instead, the New York City mayor embraced a more optimistic tone. \"We are living in a time of miracles. We are living in a time we could not imagine,\" he exclaimed. \"We hold the keys. It is about us being bold and relentless.\" Inslee, a second-term governor, took the stage to discuss an issue often divorced from the reality of day-to-day politics: climate change. According to Inslee, environmental protection policy \u2013 often\u00a0stalled\u00a0and even\u00a0mocked\u00a0within the Trump White House \u2013 cannot be stopped on the state level. \"Donald Trump cannot stop us states\u2014governors\u2014from creating a clean energy future.\" The urgent task of fighting back, argued Evergreen state lawmaker, is evident to American people suffering the consequences of natural disaster. \"Climate change will no longer be on the back burner,\" Inslee stated. \"They have watched the hurricane \u2013 they have seen the forest fire.\" Inslee nodded along with fellow panelists, Tom Steyer, president and founder of NextGen America and senior vice president of Climate, Environmental Justice & Community Revitalization Mustafa Santiago Ali, who advocated for economic equality in environmental protection policy and solutions. In order to achieve success, Inslee said, economic equality and the fight against climate change must go hand in hand, \"so we don't get into a schism between the haves and have-nots in an economy that is already unequal.\" Asked about California's decision Wednesday to require that all new homes have solar panels, Inslee interjected, \"Washington has to figures out a way for everyone to do that.\" The two-term senator is the only Democrat holding statewide office in the Buckeye State, and he faces reelection this year in a state that Trump won by roughly 8 points. In the kickoff event at the conference, Brown shared how he plans to focus on a populist economic message during his reelection campaign. For Brown, it boils down to this: \"Are you on the side of Wall Street or are you fighting for the little guy? Whether she works in a diner, whether he works in an office, whether she's punching a time clock, whether he's working at a construction site?\" He added that there is too little focus on the economic success of the middle class and too much discussion of how well Wall Street is doing. \"We don't speak to small-town America, we don't speak to workers. I just think so much of this \u2013 from infrastructure to wages, to tax policy \u2026 we're not there yet,\" he said. \"We very much can be.\" Despite Mr. Trump's popularity in Ohio, Brown said he will call out the president if he believes the White House is working counter to the needs of Ohio voters. Brown said he's especially upset by Trump's decision to help Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. Over the weekend the president unexpectedly tweeted\u00a0that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were \"working together\" to give ZTE \"a way to get back into business, fast,\" saying too many jobs in China were at stake after the U.S. government cut off access to its American suppliers. Brown disagreed, saying it's wrong that the president is \"fighting for a Chinese company that's broken international laws.\" He also blasted Mr. Trump for passing up an opportunity during a White House meeting last week to confront General Motors CEO Mary Barra about some of the company's recent jobs cuts \"after GM's gotten hundreds of billions of tax cuts. You call out that kind of hypocrisy.\" The senior senator from the Land of 10,000 Lakes is up for reelection this year, but eagerly seeks to be part of the conversation about 2020. She joined Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in a panel discussion about democracy and the rule of law. They agreed that President Trump is undermining the work of the Justice Department by frequently speaking out about active criminal investigations on Twitter or by trying to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Klobuchar's strongest moment came in response to an audience member who asked how Democrats can try to spark more visceral reactions from voters. She said she's already seen evidence of such reactions in the come-from-behind victories of Democrats Doug Jones in an Alabama U.S. Senate special election and Conor Lamb, who was able to narrowly win in a Pennsylvania congressional district that supported Trump by more than 20 points in 2016. As she campaigns for reelection, voters are asking about \"health care premiums\" \u2013 not necessarily about the latest Trump scandal, Klobuchar said. \"They're not asking me about Russian bots -- they're asking me about soybean exports,\" she said, adding later, \"All of that doesn't mean that we just ignore this assault on our democracy.\" \"We're not going to succeed if we spend all our time bemoaning that he's there. He's there. And we have to present an alternative,\" she added. The former secretary of Housing and Urban Development is putting the finishing touches on a book due out this fall, teaching at the University of Texas at Austin \u2013 and preparing for a possible 2020 presidential campaign. Castro told us in a separate interview that he's likely to make a decision about whether to run after November's elections. Until then, he's leading a super PAC that is supporting younger, mostly minority candidates running for governor and Congress across the country. His brief remarks to the conference focused on a universal message of \"meaningful opportunity\" for all Americans \u2013 a society that supports and rewards hard work, but also bolsters government aid programs. \"The only reason I can stand here is because I worked hard. My family worked hard,\" he told the crowd. \"We invested in ourselves but America also invested in us. I believe that is when our country has been at its greatest,\" the secretary said, adding later: \"In the United States, we don't have a single person to waste. We need everyone's talent to succeed.\" The remarks earned a polite, if tepid response from attendees. But Castro isn't on the ballot this November \u2013 he's merely looking to stay involved in the conversation. The junior senator from the Empire State faces re-election this year. While the Democratic lawmaker is expected to win handily in her deep blue home state of New York, her tougher challenge will lie in a possible presidential bid in 2020, if she decides to run. The senator from New York has not backed down from taking on Mr. Trump both in political and personal spats. After the president tweeted last year, calling Gillibrand a \"lightweight\" and \"and someone who would come to my office 'begging' for campaign contributions,\" the legislator fired back. \"I will not be silent on this issue, neither will women who stood up to the president yesterday and neither will the millions of women who have been marching.\" Gillibrand echoed those sentiments today in a \"Women's Power\" panel alongside former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, National Women's Law Center president and CEO Fatima Goss Graves, Voto Latino president and CEO Mar\u00eda Teresa Kumar and Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. \"A year and a half after our generation's own women's march the grass roots energy is growing, it is not fading,\" Gillibrand declared. \"And women are holding our democracy together in these dangerous times. It is women who are taking their outrage and running for office, volunteering, protesting, resisting and persisting.\" Playing to the audience, the senator took direct aim at Republicans, vowing Democrats will work to \"take back\" the House and Senate. \"The reason we don't have a credibly accused pedophile in the U.S. Senate is because black women in Alabama stood up and said no, not in my state,\" she said, referencing fmr. Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, inspiring a round of enthusiastic applause.\u00a0 Arthur Jones II contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Michael Cohen, President Trump's longtime personal attorney, arranged a $130,000 payment to a leading porn star in return for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, say that Cohen arranged the payment in October 2016 to Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels. Clifford was one of the most popular adult actresses in the country when she met Mr. Trump in 2006 at a golf championship in Nevada. She was 27 years old at the time, and Mr. Trump would have just turned 60. \"These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,\" a White House official said in response. Cohen didn't comment on the alleged pay-off, although he did tell the paper that \"President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.\" \"This is now the second time that you are raising outlandish allegations against my client,\" Cohen added. \"You have attempted to perpetuate this false narrative for over a year; a narrative that has been consistently denied by all parties since at least 2011.\" Cohen also released a statement signed by \"Stormy Daniels\" denying that she has a \"sexual and/or romantic affair\" with Mr. Trump, who married his wife Melania in 2005. \"When I met Donald Trump, he was gracious, professional and a complete GENTLEMAN to me and everyone in my presence,\" the statement says.\u00a0 Clifford had been in talks to discuss Mr. Trump with ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in the weeks leading up to the election when Cohen arranged the payment to her, according to the Journal.  The payment, the Journal reports, was made through Clifford's attorney, Keith Davidson. Davidson declined to comment on the story, citing \"attorney-client privilege.\"  On Friday night, the website The Daily Beast reported they had planned to publish the story about Clifford and Mr. Trump before the election, but Clifford backed out of an interview. A friend of Daniels told The Daily Beast that Clifford told her she and Mr. Trump were \"more than just friends.\" \"Stormy said she met Donald Trump and then tells me about the golf tournament and how she's supposed to hang out with him later that night, and she invited me,\" said fellow porn star Alana Evans. \"Stormy said Donald knew exactly who she was and wanted to meet her.\" \u00a0 Evans told The Daily Beast Clifford told her \"'All I'm going to say is: I ended up with Donald in his hotel room' ... \u00a0I was like, 'Oh I really didn't need to hear that!' Then she said he offered her keys to his condos in Florida, and I was like, 'Wow guess you had a good night,' and that was the last we ever spoke of it.\"   After the golf outing in Nevada in which he met Clifford, Mr. Trump was accused by adult-film actress Jessica Drake of kissing her against her will. Drake told the paper she did \"not receive any money for coming forward\" and was not subject to a non-disclosure agreement. The White House dismisses Drake's claim as \"totally false and ridiculous.\"  Clifford reportedly entertained the idea of challenging then-Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, in 2010. At the time, she said she was a Republican.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina that aired Sunday, Nov. 25, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin today with Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy who leads the main investigative- investigative committee of the House of Representatives. He joins us this morning from Greenville South Carolina. Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. You've been busy over the holiday. REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We know that Congressman. A subpoena was sent to fired FBI Director James Comey calling for him to testify before your committee. He's objecting to the format saying this has to be in public. It can't be in private because information will be selectively leaked. I know on this program in the past you have said that Congressional investigations, \"leak like the gossip girls.\" Do you think that comes right to object? REP. GOWDY: You know, Margaret, I don't get a chance to say this very often, but I do think Jim Comey is right. Leaks are counterproductive whether Jim Comey is doing it, whether the FBI is doing it, or whether Congress is doing it. The remedy for leaks is not to have a public hearing where you are supposed to ask about 17 months worth of work in five minutes. I think the remedy is to videotape the deposition. Videotape the transcribed interview. That way the public can see whether the question was fair. They could judge the entirety of the answer. But there is no fact finder on- on the planet that tries to discover the truth in five minute increments. And I can't think of one that does it on national television. So we have to do it the same way we've handled every other witness which is a transcribed interview a deposition. I am sensitive to leaks. I hate leaks. I think they undercut the- the authenticity of the investigation but the remedy is not to have a professional wrestling- type carnival atmosphere which is what Congressional public hearings have become. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well how would a tape deposition change that? I mean his concern is that he's implying that this is just be political grandstanding. REP. GOWDY: Well, people act differently when there aren't cameras in the room. Trust me when I say that. There are very constructive interviews when there is no camera. What I would propose - and Bob Goodlatte is the chairman he- he can decide - what I would propose is videotape that interview from pillar to post. Scrub it for classified information in case somebody inadvertently asks or answers and then release it to the public. Release the entire interview but do not make members of Congress question someone that Democrats think cost Hillary Clinton the election. And Republicans have a lot of questions for. Do not ask us to limit 17 months worth of decision making to five minutes of questions no other serious fact finder tries to do it in five minutes. So I don't know why Congress thinks it can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a formal offer to Mr. Comey? REP. GOWDY: Oh if I were the chairman of Judiciary it would be a formal offer. I- I think Bob Goodlatte- Bob Goodlatte hates leaks every bit as much as I do which is why he doesn't do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REP. GOWDY: But he also is not going to let Jim Comey who by the way the FBI has never conducted an interview in public. Never. And he wasn't interviewed by Mueller in public. So the notion that Jim Comey all of a sudden loves public interviews he hadn't done it his entire career. So Bob Goodlatte will decide and it won't be Jim Comey. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also put in a request this week to the White House for more information about why Ivanka Trump, a presidential adviser and obviously the president's daughter, was using private email for government- government business. People remember you well from the probe you lead into Benghazi that helped to uncover Hillary Clinton's use of private email. At the time you said that there should be prosecution of her for divulging classified information or in any way mishandling it. Would you similarly call for that kind of prosecution of the president's daughter? REP. GOWDY: Well I will defer to whatever tape may exist but I have assiduously tried to avoid ever calling for the prosecution of anyone including Hillary Clinton. And I'm pretty sure that's true because I've had a lot of Republicans upset with me. They're two separate issues, the divulging of classified information is a crime using personal email upon which to conduct public business is not a crime. You're not supposed to do it. It's not best practices. It actually violates statutes and regulations. Pub- Public work is-is a privilege and-and part of that is you give up the right to use your private email to conduct government work. So you should keep record. Ms. Clinton should do it, Eric Holder. Everyone throughout government who conducts official business should use official email. If you don't then you should take other steps to safeguard it. And- and that's what we need to know from Mr. Trump but I've never called for Hillary Clinton to be prosecuted and I couldn't possibly have done it for using private email because it's not a crime. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mishandling classified information. I think some have interpreted your past statements about that to have called for further actions but in this case the president has already said for Ivanka Trump that he thinks there is nothing to see here. Are you concerned that he is saying that at this point before there is an investigation by your committee? REP. GOWDY: I am concerned anytime any president prejudges the outcome of an investigation. Whether it's President Obama, whether it's President Trump. I've already talked to Ms. Trump's attorney. I've already talked to Mr. Cummings. We've already written a letter to the White House. Congress has a responsibility to make sure that the records and the Presidential Records Act is complied with and that is true no matter-no matter who the person is, whether it's Secretary Clinton or whether it's Tom Perez or whether it's Ivanka Trump. So we've taken steps, we've done more in the last week than in some of my house Democratic colleagues did the entire time we were looking into Benghazi. So I'm at peace with what we've done but we need the information and we need it quickly. And then the public can judge whether or not those two fact patterns are similar. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you before you go. You're an attorney, you're a former federal prosecutor. Do you agree with the very unusual public statement that we heard this week from Chief Justice John Roberts who rebuked the president in many ways saying, \"we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges Bush judges or Clinton judges.\" Do you share his concern that the judiciary is being politicized? MARGARET BRENNAN: Margaret, I wish Chief Justice Roberts were right. I wish there were not a politicization of the judici-judiciary. But it's not just politicians. Every print article that you will go find this afternoon refers to judges based on the president that put him or her in office. And you see terms like conservative and ultra conservative and liberal and moderate which are political terms but they're used to describe judges. So I wish Chief Justice Roberts were right. I wish that we did not refer to judges based on which president put them in office as if that is somehow going to inextricably lead us to the conclusion. But it's been happening since I was a kid. It's been happening for 50 years that we have used political terms to describe judges. I wish we would stop. But President Trump is not the first person to do it. I think President Obama criticized the Supreme Court to their face in the State of the Union. So I wish everyone would stop including the media referring to judges based on which President put them in office. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman Gowdy, good to talk to you. Thanks for joining us today. REP. GOWDY: Yes ma'am. Thank you.",

            "article_content": "LONDON \u2014The Moscow lawyer said to have promised President Trump's campaign dirt on his Democratic opponent worked more closely with senior Russian government officials than she previously let on, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press. Scores of emails, transcripts and legal documents paint a portrait of Natalia Veselnitskaya as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghostwriter for top Russian government lawyers and received assistance from senior Interior Ministry personnel in a case involving a key client. The data was obtained through Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky's London-based investigative unit, the Dossier Center, that is compiling profiles of Russians it accuses of benefiting from corruption. The data was later shared with journalists at the AP, the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, Greek news website Inside Story and others. The AP was unable to reach Veselnitskaya for comment. Messages from a reporter sent to her phone were marked as \"read\" but were not returned. A list of questions sent via email went unanswered. Veselnitskaya has been under scrutiny since it emerged last year that Mr. Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., met with her in June 2016 after being told by an intermediary that she represented the Russian government and was offering Moscow's help defeating rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya has denied acting on behalf of Russian officialdom when she met with the Trump team, telling Congress that she operates \"independently of any government bodies.\" But recent reporting has cast doubt on her story. In an April interview with NBC News, Veselnitskaya acknowledged acting as an \"informant\" for the Russian government after being confronted with an earlier batch of emails obtained through the Dossier Center. The new documents reviewed by AP suggest her ties to Russian authorities are close \u2014 and they pull the curtain back on her campaign to overturn the sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russian officials. The source of the material is murky. Veselnitskaya has previously said that her emails were hacked. Khodorkovsky told AP he couldn't know where the messages came from, saying his group maintained a series of anonymous digital drop boxes. The AP worked to authenticate the 200-odd documents, in some cases by verifying the digital signatures carried in email headers. In three other cases, individuals named in various email chains confirmed that the messages were genuine. Other correspondence was partially verified by confirming the nonpublic phone numbers or email addresses they held, including some belonging to senior Russian officials and U.S. lobbyists. Veselnitskaya's role in the drama over the Trump campaign's Russian connections is rooted in her fight against Bill Browder, the American-born British businessman who has become a leading critic of the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Browder's decade-plus crusade against the Kremlin has so enraged Russian officials that Putin demanded his extradition to Moscow during his press conference with President Trump in Helsinki earlier this month. The feud took off in 2009, when a lawyer working for Browder, Sergey Magnitsky, died in a Moscow prison under suspicious circumstances. Magnitsky had been investigating a multimillion dollar embezzlement scheme allegedly involving Russian tax officials when he was arrested, and Browder turned his death into a cause celebre, successfully lobbying Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that slapped the officials implicated in the scandal with visa bans and asset freezes. Moscow has responded with a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian orphans and by an unrelenting campaign against Browder, who says he's been the subject of more than a half-dozen attempts to extradite him to Russia through Interpol. Browder has refused to back down, pushing for copycat legislation across the world. Veselnitskaya has taken the counteroffensive, battling him in court across Europe and the U.S. and organizing a media and lobbying campaign to undercut his credibility in Washington. Veselnitskaya told Congress last year that her interest in Browder was \"all part of my job defending a specific person\" \u2014 her client Denis Katsyv, who Browder accuses of laundering money through the company Prevezon. But the documents obtained through the Dossier Center show she both received Russian government support and provided assistance to high-level authorities in Moscow. When Swiss officials investigating Prevezon arrived in Moscow on September 2015 to interrogate Katsyv, for example, they were met not just by Veselnitskaya but by Lt. Col. A. V. Ranchenkov, a senior Interior Ministry official previously known for his role investigating the Russian punk band Pussy Riot. Ranchenkov devoted a chunk of the interview to questions about the legality of Browder's actions, according to a transcript of the interrogation reviewed by email. The Russian Interior Ministry did not return messages seeking comment. Two years later, the emails show, Veselnitskaya was mixed up in the Russian government's attempt to extract financial information from Browder's former law firm in Cyprus. An Oct. 31, 2017, email shows Veselnitskaya's office preparing a draft version of Russian Deputy General Prosecutor Mikhail Alexandrov's affidavit to Cypriot authorities. \"This is needed by tomorrow,\" she wrote a subordinate. Two weeks later, a finalized version of the same document was sent by a Russian diplomatic staffer to a Cypriot counterpart, the Dossier Center's files show. Browder said this reinforced the idea that Veselnitskaya was enmeshed with Russian officialdom. \"If her office is drafting replies for Russian-Cyprus law enforcement cooperation, in my opinion that effectively shows that she's an agent of the Russian government and not an independent lawyer as she claims,\" he said in a telephone interview. In a written statement, the Russian Embassy in Cyprus called the AP's questions a \"provocation\" and that it had \"no idea who is Nataliya Veselnitskaya and what she sends or doesn't send to the Cypriot Officials.\" Alexandrov, reached at the prosecutor-general's office, refused to speak to the AP. Veselnitskaya tried to extend her influence to the United States. The emails obtained through the Dossier Center show her at the center of a multipronged lobbying operation aimed at halting Browder's momentum in Washington. One prong was aimed at building a grassroots support for the effort to overturn the Magnitsky Act, or at least create the illusion of one. A potential ally in this effort was the Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption Including Neighboring Countries, or FRUA, a charity that supports families who adopt children from former Soviet bloc nations. Jan Wondra, the organization's chairman, said she attended a meeting in Washington on June 8, 2016, that with a group of people including Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who was working with Veselnitskaya to overturn U.S. sanctions against Russia. The group told her they had evidence that the Magnitsky Act had been propelled by bogus claims spread by Browder and his allies, Wondra said, a revelation the group said could lead to the overturning of the Russian adoption ban. Wondra told the AP she was suspicious and feared that the lobbyists wanted FRUA's endorsement for their own purposes. 'My antennae were out. I looked at this as an attempt to put public pressure on Congress to rescind all or a part of the Magnitsky Act,\" she said, emphasizing that she spoke only for herself, not her organization. \"The conclusion I drew was that FRUA should not participate. And we didn't.\" Akhmetshin, who would join Veselnitskaya at the Trump Tower meeting the next day, declined comment. While the lobbyists were wooing Wondra, Veselnitskaya was overseeing the creation of a new organization called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, or HRAGI, which billed itself as a grass-roots group devoted to overturning the Russian adoption ban. A Bloomberg report shows the organization was in fact funded by Russian friends of Katsyv \u2014 something Veselnitskaya appeared eager to keep secret. \"Is it possible to open a Fund account here in Russia, so we can collect money from donations and then pay them into an account anonymously in the U.S?\" she wrote Mark Cymrot, a lawyer at the U.S. law firm BakerHostetler, in a March 17, 2016, email. Cymrot represented Prevezon, the Katsyv-owned company accused by Browder of being a conduit for the ill-gotten money Magnitsky was tracking before he died. But Cymrot did more than just fight Veselnitskaya's corner in American court; he also helped her undercut Browder's crusading image in the American media. For this, Cymrot turned to Fusion GPS, a private intelligence firm that prepared a 660-odd page media dossier on Browder for circulation to journalists. Fusion also was tasked with background research for Veselnitskaya's work convincing elected representatives to push back against Browder's campaign in Washington, where the Global Magnitsky Bill, an enlarged version of the 2012 law, was wending its way through Congress. The emails capture Cymrot writing to Fusion to ask for damning material on Browder to send to a senior staffer on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. \"Any articles critical of Browder,\" Cymrot told Fusion, saying the staffer had asked for \"anything we have that could be helpful.\" \"Time is of the essence,\" he added, noting that the global bill was only two days from the beginning of the amendment process. Cymrot said his work did not constitute lobbying. \"You're misinterpreting what occurred,\" he said in a telephone interview. When pressed for details, he asked for questions in writing. When these were provided, he did not respond. BakerHostetler also did not respond to written questions. Whatever Cymrot's role, Veselnitskaya's modest American lobbying effort came to naught. The Global Magnitsky Act cleared the Committee on Foreign Affairs amid overwhelming bipartisan support. It was signed into law on Dec. 23, 2016. The campaign to knock the wind out of Browder's sails began to draw blowback as the political climate changed. On July 16, 2016, Browder filed a formal complaint with the Justice Department accusing Cymrot, Akhmetshin, Fusion founder Glenn Simpson and many of their colleagues of acting as unregistered agents for Russia. In October 2016, a judge threw BakerHostetler off the Prevezon case on the grounds of conflict of interest, since the firm had previously represented Browder. It eventually was replaced by Los Angeles-based Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. After Mr. Trump's election in November, the once-discreet Fusion was thrust into the white-hot center of Mr. Trump's Washington when it was revealed that the private intelligence company had commissioned the dossier containing explosive claims about the future president's behavior in Russia. Republican politicians seized on Browder's 2016 complaint about Fusion to try to undermine the dossier's authors, accusing Simpson, for example, of secretly working on behalf of the Russian state, or of letting his work for Prevezon overlap with his opposition research on Mr. Trump. Simpson denied the charges in his testimony before Congress. In a statement Thursday, Fusion's lawyer Joshua A. Levy said the company had provided litigation support \u2014 not lobbying \u2014 and that its Trump research had survived determined Republican efforts to discredit it. Others in Veselnitskaya's orbit took a little time to get their story straight, a document obtained through the Dossier Center suggests. The April 2017 document initially has Robert Arakelian, the owner of the HRAGI organization working to overturn the adoption ban, explaining that he is exempt from the requirement to register as a foreign agent and saying he created the organization \"at the request of Denis Katsyv.\" The document's tracked changes suggest a BakerHostetler lawyer rewrote the charity's origin story wholesale, deleting the reference to Katsyv and saying instead that the adoption group was established after Arakelian met Akhmetshin, the lobbyist, and \"learned that the law is unjust and based on false information provided to members of the United States Congress.\" The BakerHostetler lawyer then inserted a sentence explaining that there were no agreements between the adoption group, Katsyv, Prevezon \"or any other foreign persons or principals from the Russian Federation.\" The only foreign link, the document said, was an \"informal representation\" by Veselnitskaya. Arakelian didn't return an email seeking comment. As the rewriting of the document shows, BakerHostetler was still involved with Prevezon and its entourage despite the judge having ordered the firm off the case months before. Faith Gay of Quinn Emanuel told Veselnitskaya on May 1, 2017, that she was still in touch with BakerHostetler even though the firm couldn't officially participate in trial preparations. \"We have been trying to talk with them informally as much as possible,\" she wrote. Gay no longer works for the firm and declined comment when approached by the AP. But several emails show her former colleagues copying counterparts at BakerHostetler on trial-related matters, as well as BakerHostetler lawyers offering their feedback throughout the first half of 2017. Cymrot defended his continued work on Prevezon, saying the lawyers at Quinn Emanuel needed help navigating the complex case they had taken on right up until the moment Prevezon settled with the government on May 19, 2017. \"It was all under the transition period,\" he said in his interview. Cymrot refused to divulge whether he or others at BakerHostetler were paid for their work, calling that information privileged. Worries about the behind-the-scenes assistance becoming public would prove a source of concern after news of Veselnitskaya's meeting at Trump Tower became public. Within weeks, she, Akhmetshin, Simpson and others were called before Congress and investigators subpoenaed their emails. Quinn Emmanuel warned Veselnitskaya that the email exchanges could be damaging and urged her to declare them off-limits. Releasing the messages could result in \"a question being raised about BakerHostleter representing Prevezon's interests well beyond the district court's disqualification of them as Prevezon's counsel,\" one lawyer wrote. Veselnitskaya initially shrugged off the issue. \"I can see no reason to worry,\" she wrote on Aug. 18. But five days later, senior Quinn Emanuel lawyer Faith Gay reemphasized the point, arguing that the documents should be kept secret \"as it seems to us that it could be your friends at BakerHostetler in a bad light.\" Quinn Emanuel did not respond to a list of questions. Veselnitskaya's final response isn't captured in the messages obtained through the Dossier Center, but she appears to have relented. The emails between BakerHostetler, Fusion and congressional staffers were never made public. Instead, a two-page email log was produced labeling the material \"confidential communication performed at the direction of counsel in anticipation of litigation.\" The emails obtained by AP leave some unanswered questions. In particular, the Dossier Center's investigation turned up almost no messages about the Trump Tower meeting, its lead-up or its aftermath. The group said it received only a few messages dealing with the media queries when the meeting became public in mid-2017. That could lend credence to arguments by the Trump campaign and Veselnitskaya that both sides quickly realized the get-together was a waste of time. \"I wanted to go away as soon as possible,\" she told Congress. \"And I felt Trump Jr. wanted the same too.\" The messages also carry no hint of the Trump dossier, and nothing in the material challenges Simpson's testimony that Fusion's work for Prevezon was kept separate from its work on Mr. Trump. Finally, there's no mention in the documents of the Russian hack-and-leak operation that began rattling the Democrats immediately following Veselnitskaya's visit. The only hints of cyberespionage in the documents appear to revolve around concerns that Veselnitskaya or members of her entourage might have their messages hacked by others. About a week before the Trump Tower meeting, for example, Veselnitskaya's translator warned Arakelian, the owner of HRAGI, the adoption group, that their emails were vulnerable and suggested switching to more secure channels. \"We need to think about how to send files via Telegram, Signal or PGP,\" he said.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These are not the actions of a man. They are a crimes of a monster instead.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: President Trump said the strike was perfectly executed and that the mission was accomplished.   But some in Congress say the strikes didn't go far enough. Either way, the question remains, what exactly is the strategy in Syria and the conflict that's now in its seventh year?  Ambassador Nikki Haley has been leading the diplomatic effort at the United Nations.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.   When our president draws a red line, our president enforces the red line.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: We will talk with Ambassador Haley, then with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. He called the strikes illegal and reckless, since the president did not seek the approval of Congress before the attack.  Plus, the president's legal problems intensify after the FBI raids his personal attorney's office and home. Michael Cohen is now the subject of a criminal investigation into his business, which may impact his sole client, President Trump.  And another headache for the president, as former FBI Director James Comey's tell-all book is released. We will have analysis on all the news and what's next in Syria coming up on FACE THE NATION.   Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.   Friday night's strike in Syria was launched by British, French and U.S. aircraft, ships and a submarine. Over 100 missiles were fired at three sites in Syria that the U.S. identified as chemical weapons facilities.   Syrian attempts to shoot them down failed and Russian forces held their fire, avoiding the escalation that U.S. officials had feared.   Defense Secretary Mattis called it a heavy strike, but a one-time shot that set the Syrians' chemical weapons program back for years.   CBS News foreign correspondent Seth Doane and his team are in Damascus under the supervision of the Syrian government.   Seth, what's the latest?   SETH DOANE, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Margaret.   The advances here that the Syrian forces have made going into Douma is the big news this morning, remaining control of that area that had been held by the rebels. And that is quite significant because it likely gives chemical weapons inspectors access to that site.  BRENNAN: Now, you did get access to one of the sites that was hit in that allied show of force on Friday. What did you find?   DOANE: We got into one of the areas that had been a research facility here in Damascus, a sort of university. We were there as it was still smoldering and firefighters were still putting out the fire.   These buildings had been completely destroyed. Now, this is a site that the U.S. government, the Pentagon says is key to the development of biological and chemical weapons here in Syria.   We met a scientist who was there on the site who told us he had worked there for 38 years. And he said they were not developing chemical weapons there. It is just another example here in Syria where you are hearing very different facts or allegations from both sides of this conflict.   BRENNAN: The Trump administration says it's not going to intervene in the civil war. Will Friday's strike any impact on the course of the conflict?   DOANE: There is a real defiance that we have seen on the ground here in Syria. But what we have seen from the Syrian government is a determination to move forward and make it appear as though it is business as usual.   You saw those pictures that were released right away by the Syrian presidency and the propaganda wing here showing Bashar al-Assad walking into buildings appeared unfazed following these airstrikes.   BRENNAN: Seth Doane, than you for your reporting there from the bustling capital of Damascus.  Very different images from what we saw in that area hit by alleged that chemical attack just nearby.   We're joined now by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. She's in New York this morning.  Good morning to you, Madam Ambassador.   The White House said they have been reports that since April of last year, there have been at least 30 continued chemical weapons attacks in Syria, some involving sarin.   Why did this particular attack last week warrant military action, but the others didn't?   HALEY: Good morning, Margaret.   Well, I think that obviously this was cumulative. He -- Assad had been using chemical weapons multiple times. But more so, this was about the Security Council resolutions. We had up until this point had six different resolutions that would have dealt with investigative mechanisms for chemical weapons, and Russia had vetoed all of them.   And so we felt like we had gone through every diplomatic measure of talking that we could, and it was time for action. And I think one thing that we hope Assad got the message on is the international community will not allow chemical weapons to come back into our everyday life, and the fact that he was making this more normal and that Russia was covering it up, all of that has to stop.   BRENNAN: Are there any consequences for Assad's patrons, Russia and Iran, who continue to protect him?   HALEY: Absolutely.   So, you will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down. Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday, if he hasn't already. And they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons used.   And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message, and our hope is that they listen to it.   BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. strikes, while they hit their targets, they still left Assad regime in place, along with all those instruments of Russian and Iranian backing.   Senator Lindsey Graham, who you know well, has said he fears this is a weak military response. So what is the U.S. plan for follow-up?   HALEY: Well, make no question about it. This was a very strong response.   I mean, first of all, we went after their storage facilities where they kept components. We went after their massive research facility, which was the heart of their chemical weapons program. And we went after their production facility.   So, this was very strong attack on the chemical weapons program. We were not looking for war. That's the last thing the president wanted was war. We were not looking to kill people. That was not something that in our American values we would want to do.   We wanted to send a strong message that they needed to stop the chemical weapons program. We wanted -- with the political and diplomatic actions that we're taking now, we wanted their friends Iran and Russia to know that we meant business and that they were going to feel the pain from this as well.   But our goal is not to start war. And our goal is not to kill people. Our goal is to send a very strong message to Assad and his friends that we are not going to watch them continue to use chemical weapons on their people.   BRENNAN: But there is concern that there's a risk, without diplomatic follow-up, this just looks like muscle-flexing. In your assessment, has Assad won this war?   HALEY: This was not muscle-flexing. We sent their chemical weapons program back years.   So from that standpoint, when we look at threats to national -- our American national interests, we definitely did exactly what we wanted to do.   (CROSSTALK)  BRENNAN: But Assad's military has reclaimed the area where these chemical weapons were used. He's declaring victory there.   HALEY: Look, Assad has made inroads in terms of taking back property and land and all this. But that's what the Geneva process is for.   We're very involved in the political process of trying to get to a constitution, of trying to allow the people to elect who is going to lead them. Our job was never to take Assad out. Our job was never to start a war. And so what we have done is, we have continued to stay involved diplomatically. We will see that through in terms of the political solution.   From a military standpoint, we felt like along with our allies we needed to make a strong message towards them that Russia can cover up in the United Nations, but Russia cannot cover up when it comes to military strikes on Syria.   And I think that message was heard loud and clear around the world. And so, we feel very good about the message that was sent. It is now up to Bashar al-Assad to see if he's smart enough to receive that message.  BRENNAN: When you say the Geneva process, that's the Obama era U.N.-led process that's been stalled for years that would have Assad eventually negotiate.   Are you open to direct talks with the Assad regime between the U.S. and the Assad regime?   HALEY: Well, let's be clear. That is a process that's being handled in the United Nations that has been ongoing and constant.   So these talks, they come together. What has happened up until now is, Syria has refused to come to the table to negotiate. But Russia and all of the other actors involved are coming to the table. And now it's Russia's turn to deliver Syria to the table for that political process.   So it's moving. It's not moving near as fast as any of us want it to move. But this is a political process that needs to happen. This is not something that we need to militarily go and do regime change. This is something that we have to make sure a political process goes through.   The United Nations is the right place to facilitate that, because they do bring on all of the actors to the table. And we all hope for a political solution for the sake of the Syrian people.   BRENNAN: So, no direct talks between the U.S. and Syria at this point?   HALEY: No. And we would never want to have direct talks with Syria at this point. They're not worthy of talks with the United States. They have done nothing but brutalize their people and destroy their land, all in the name of power.   And so our goal is that, yes, we will be at the talks ,as we have been, related to the Geneva process. The United States is always there and we will continue to be there.   But, no, we are not going to have any one-on-one talks with Assad.   BRENNAN: President Trump intends to bring U.S. troops home from Syria.  If he does that in the next six months, as he said he has wanted to do, doesn't that cede the battleground to Iran?   HALEY: Well, we haven't said that we're going to bring them home in six months.   What we are saying is, at some point, we want to see our military come home. That is obviously the end goal. But there are three things that we have to do to get there. First of all, the president's made it very clear we cannot have chemical weapons usage anywhere. And we will continue to combat that in any way we need to protect American interests.   Secondly, we want to make sure that they understand that ISIS has to be defeated completely and wholly, in a way that we know that we have stabilized the region. We have made fantastic progress on that front.   But we're not going to stop until we know that that area is free of ISIS. And then, thirdly, we want to make sure that the influence of Iran doesn't take over the area. They continue to cause problems throughout the region, and we want to make sure that there is a hold.   The president has asked allies to step up and do more when it comes to Syria. And so all of these things are being done in the name of bringing our military home.   BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president called the FBI raid on his personal attorney's home an attack on our country in a true sense.   He's fired off number of tweets this morning about the fired FBI director, calling him a slime ball, suggesting he should be jailed. What is the president's state of mind?   (LAUGHTER)  HALEY: Well, I have spent multiple times with the president at the White House and on the phone this past week.   And his state of mind was very much focused on Syria, chemical weapons, getting the options that were there, making sure we were not doing anything to cause casualties of human life, whether it was our allies or of the Syrian people.   His focus was very much on making sure we knew all of the information so that we didn't make a misstep and waiting it out to make sure that, if we were going to do this, we were willing go to do it right.   (CROSSTALK)   BRENNAN: But is it right to consider this an attack on our country?   HALEY: Well, first of all, I have been drowning in all things Syria, North Korea and Iran. So I can't -- I'm sorry, I don't have enough information on anything related to Comey or all of those things.   I just -- I haven't watched TV to watch that. I have been very focused on foreign policy. I think the president's been focused on foreign policy, from the meetings I have been in. So I can only talk about those issues.   BRENNAN: All right, Ambassador, thank you very much.   HALEY: All right, thanks so much, Margaret.   BRENNAN: We want to go now to Richmond, Virginia, and Senator Tim Kaine.  Good morning to you, Senator.   You called these strikes illegal and reckless. The Trump administration says Article II of the Constitution gave the president clearly the powers to take this action.   Why do you think they're wrong?   SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: Margaret, I was interested to hear Ambassador Haley talk about our hope that we would to get to a Syrian constitution.   I hope President Trump will follow the American Constitution. It's very, very clear Congress has power to declare war, and only Congress. So if you are initiating war against a sovereign nation like Syria that hadn't declared war on United States, it's only Congress that can do it.   President Trump is not a king. He's a president. He's supposed to come to Congress to seek permission to initiate a war. As Ambassador Haley said, they had been following these chemical weapons attacks for months. They clearly had time to come to Congress to seek our permission.   And this is really important, Margaret. It's not just about the Constitution. It's about the value underlying the Constitution. The framers basically said, if we're going to order our troops to risk their lives, put them in a situation where they can kill others, be killed or wounded themselves, then there has to be a debate and vote by Congress to say, this is in the national interest.   The president flouting this and saying, I can do it without Congress, what's to stop him from starting a bombing campaign against Iran or North Korea or some other nation and saying, well, I think it's in the national interest?  It's illegal because he didn't come and ask permission. Moreover, it's reckless because, as you pointed out, there isn't a strategy. We need to defeat ISIS, but we hear different things from the administration. Are we staying there now to topple Assad, to counter Iran, to check Russia, to help the Kurds, to buttress Israel, to rebuild our relationships with Turkey?   They haven't laid out a strategy. And military action shouldn't be taken as a one-off. It should be taken as part of a strategy.   BRENNAN: So, do you not think U.S. should have taken action in the wake of a chemical attack?   KAINE: Margaret, when President Obama came to Congress on exactly the same instance in 2014, saying, Syria has used chemical weapons against civilians, Congress should give authority for us to take military action, I voted for that as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.   But the president was doing it the right way. He came forward with a plan and a strategy. And we voted yes.  BRENNAN: Well, he wasn't going to get the full support of Congress on that one.   KAINE: Well, look, we got a resolution out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It was on the floor of the Senate. And then Syria said, we will give up our weapons stockpile.   But, as you know, in 2014, at that point...  BRENNAN: They did not, clearly.   KAINE: ... citizen -- citizen -- citizen Donald Trump said the president can't constitutionally do this without coming to Congress.   Mike Pompeo, as a House member, currently being considered as secretary of state, said, the president needs Congress.   I'm very troubled that this is a president who seemed to understand what the Constitution required when President Obama was in office, but now he thinks he's a king and he can do whatever he wants without Congress.   BRENNAN: You mentioned Mike Pompeo. The CIA director was before your committee this week testifying as he sort of auditions for this role of secretary of state.   You voted for him as CIA director. Will you vote for him to be the next secretary of state?   KAINE: Margaret, I have decided to vote against him to be secretary of state. I did vote for him as CIA director. He has an intel background that I thought suited him for the position.   But, look, we have a president who is anti-diplomacy. And I worry that Mike Pompeo has shown the same tendency to oppose diplomacy. He was not just against the Iran deal when he was a House member, but he spoke about the relative ease of wiping out Iran's nuclear capacity with a bombing run. He has supported regime change.  BRENNAN: Well, Senator, that's significant that you're saying that you're not going to vote for him, because this would mean he's the first nominee to be secretary of state to not get a favorable recommendation by that committee.   But this still doesn't stop him from becoming America's top diplomat. He can still get confirmed.  KAINE: Well, you're right. We're going to have a floor vote. And I'm telling what you my vote is. I don't want a secretary of state who is going to exacerbate the -- President Trump's tendencies to oppose diplomacy.   You have seen Donald Trump try to underfund State Department and USAID, not appoint key ambassadors, tweet out insults about foreign leaders, back the United States out of international agreements and organizations.   We do not need a secretary of state who is going to exaggerate those tendencies. We need a secretary of state who is going to stand up for strong diplomacy. And I don't believe that is Director Pompeo's inclination.   BRENNAN: Sir, I also want to ask you, because you were, of course, the running mate in the 2016 election on the Hillary Clinton ticket. You have harshly criticized former FBI Director James Comey for his decision to make it public that he was reopening that investigation into the Clinton e-mails.   He spoke to ABC News about his justification for doing so. And I want to play that for you now.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I was operating the world where Hillary Clinton was be going to beat Donald Trump. And so I'm sure that it was a factor.  Like I said, I don't remember spelling it out, but it had to have been, that she is going to be elected president. And if I hide this from the American people, she will be illegitimate the moment she's elected, that moment this comes out.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: What do you make of that explanation?   KAINE: Margaret, the FBI has two real clear rules. Don't talk about a pending investigation and don't inject controversy right before an election.   They followed those rules with respect to the ongoing investigation into Donald Trump at the time. They didn't follow the rules with respect to Hillary Clinton. There was a clear double standard.   But, look, I have so much on my plate to worry about today and tomorrow, that I'm not spending time thinking about two years ago. I'm trying to get a president to follow the Constitution. I'm trying to make sure that if we are putting our military troops in harm's risk -- I got a kid in the military. And Virginia is very, very connected to the military mission.   There's got to be a strategy. Those are the things that I'm focused on.   BRENNAN: Well, your voice and face are in some RNC ads with your criticism of the director, so I thought it was important to have you comment directly on that. You still stand by your criticism of him?  KAINE: Jim Comey, in my way of thinking, is a good man who made a very consequential blunder.   Good people make mistakes all the time. It just so happened that the double standard blunder that he made had a huge consequence.   BRENNAN: Senator, thank you very much.   And we will be back in one minute to talk about the legal problems ahead for the president's personal attorney.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   BRENNAN: It was a very busy week for investigations into President Trump and his associates, from the FBI's raid on Michael Cohen, to the blockbuster new book out by former FBI Director James Comey.   Joining us is CBS News correspondent Paula Reid to help us break it all down, because it has been overwhelming.   Michael Cohen is set to appear in Manhattan court tomorrow. The president was very upset made clear that he thought this was an assault on our country, the fact that his offices were raided.   Is this truly damaging to attorney-client privilege?   PAULA REID, CBS NEWS JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: No.  Attorney-client privilege is alive and well. And the fact is that attorney-client privilege only protects conversations you have seeking legal advice. It doesn't protect other conversations that you have with your attorney. And it certainly doesn't protect any kind of communication about a possible crime.   What is tricky about Mr. Cohen is, he's a lawyer sort of small L. He mostly works as a fixer for the president. And that is why the Justice Department was arguing in court that they're not really focused on his work as an attorney.   And it also seems that a lot of hysteria about attorney-client privilege almost seems like it could be pretext to set up the firing of the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing this investigation as the number two at the Justice Department. He oversees all the U.S. attorney's offices.   BRENNAN: And you're connecting those dots for us there.   The president was tweeting this week about the special counsel, Robert Mueller. He said he doesn't have the intention to fire him. But the White House says he does have the power to do so.   And that added to the scrutiny not just about Mueller, but Rosenstein himself. Where should we be focused?   (LAUGHTER)  REID: This was quite a revelation, that the White House believes the president can fire the special counsel, because, up until that point, most of us believed that only the deputy attorney general could fire special counsel Robert Mueller.  He could of course refuse. And Rosenstein has said multiple times he will not fire the special counsel without cause. So, if he won't do it, the president could fire the deputy attorney general. And then you get into this very unusual line of succession right now at the Justice Department.   You have just a few Justice Department officials, and then you have U.S. attorneys, because Rosenstein's immediate success, Rachel Brand, she vacated her position. She left the Justice Department. And there's a lot of Senate-confirmed positions that haven't been Senate-confirmed.  So, it's a very unusual line of succession if Rosenstein won't follow those orders. Now, on the question of can the president fire special counsel Robert Mueller, this revelation has set off a whole discussion here in Washington. I talked to a lot of legal experts.  And the prevailing theory is that the president could try to dissolve the regulation under which Mueller was appointed. Exactly. It's an internal regulation. You wouldn't need notice and comment.  But that would absolutely probably see some legal challenges. And Mueller himself could even have standing to sue.   BRENNAN: So, is there a need for that legislation that Congress is dancing around to protect him?   REID: There is certainly a cry from both sides of the aisle to try to bolster protections for Mueller and perhaps insulate him from being fired, either through dissolving the regulations or being fired without cause.   BRENNAN: Now, James Comey, who was fired as FBI director by President Trump, has put out this book. And it's got a lot of personal, very colorful descriptions of the president. Compares him to a mafia don, criticizes his skin color and his tanning, perhaps, booth goggle marks around his eyes.  It's personal. Are you surprised that this is the kind of atmospherics and language that the former FBI director is using here? Does this matter? It's clearly getting reaction from the president.   REID: Absolutely, it does matter. Words matter, right?  I mean, this is very personal. And it seems at times very petty. And the problem with that is that it bolsters the president's claim that there's a disdain for the president among top federal law enforcement law officials in this country, and it's that disdain or that contempt that drives these investigations into Cohen or the Russia probe, and not the facts.   The other important thing is, is that these petty jabs, they distract from other really important tidbits in that books, for example, the lack of focus on the Trump administration's part on preventing foreign interference in our elections.   It's very surprising that he chose to use those pages for this purpose.   BRENNAN: All right, Paula Reid, thank you for breaking it down for us.  We will be back in a moment.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   BRENNAN: Next Sunday on FACE THE NATION, we will speak with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He's leading a push for America to meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement, despite President Trump pulling out of that pact.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We will be right back with lot more FACE THE NATION, including our political panel and a discussion about just what the U.S. strategy is in Syria.   So, stay with us.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BEN STILLER, ACTOR, \"SNL\": That's right, it's Michael Cohen, attorney at law. And also sometimes not at law.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, ACTRESS, \"SNL\": Mr. Cohen, this situation is out of hand.  STILLER: I know. Can you believe what they're doing to poor Mr. Trump. It's a disgrace. This whole raid was a complete violation of attorney-criminal privilege.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE, ACTOR, \"SNL\": Well, if you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to worry about.   STILLER: Is that a joke? Look, we've got a real problem here, Jeff. You know how much evidence I have in my office? I'm Donald Trump's lawyer. I got a whole hard drive that's just labeled \"yikes.\"   (END VIDEO CLIP)  MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS ANCHOR: BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.  That was Ben stiller playing the role of President Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, from last night's \"Saturday Night Live.\"   We turn now to our panel for some analysis of it all.   Ed O'Keefe is a familiar face. As you know, he's been at this table before, but today we're welcoming him in new role, CBS News political correspondent. So you're going to be seeing a lot more of him here.   Margaret Talev is the senior White House correspondent for \"Bloomberg News\" and a CNN political analyst. Ben Domenech is the publisher of \"The Federalist.\" And Molly Ball is a national political correspondent for \"Time\" magazine, which had a cover this week that really said it all. If the \"SNL\" skit didn't, perhaps this does.  And, Molly, let's start off with that where we've also learned Michael Cohen is due in a Manhattan court tomorrow. Apparently now Stormy Daniels will also be appearing, according to her attorney.   Does -- what -- what do you make of all of this? I mean the -- it clearly irritated the president because he sat in the cabinet room at the beginning of a meeting on Syria and called this, you know, an assault on our country.   MOLLY BALL, \"TIME\": It has clearly gotten to him in a way that few other things about this investigation have. And, this morning, tweeting about Comey, which also seems to be very much under his skin.   But the -- the -- the Michael Cohen raid on Monday was a big surprise. It was a surprise to Cohen. It was a surprise to the White House. This is someone who, obviously, has a very long history with Trump and so it's been very alarming to the president to see this happen. So, you know, all of these things, and as referenced by our cover, are swirling around the president in this sort of constant cloud that envelopes him. And it's hard to know even what to emphasize because there are so many things sort of hanging over his head. We really don't know how any of them are going to end.   BRENNAN: Ben, you know, this is a criminal investigation into Michael Cohen that was made clear in court filings. And a lot of it has to do with his business. Why is the president taking it personally? How should we understand that?   BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Because it is personal to the president. It's -- that's the most personal thing that you can possibly deal with.   I mean the thing to understand about this context in terms of the southern district of New York doing this raid and engaging in this behavior is that it does definitely strike to the core of what the president thinks about himself and his own personal activities prior to becoming president. And, you know, the fact of the matter is that this -- while it started a year ago under the auspices of an investigation into Russian collusion, at the end of the day this looks more like a convincing case for collusion with \"The National Enquirer,\" which is something that will always, I think, get to the personal core of a person.   I think in -- in terms of the president's attitude towards this, this actually could be a more significant development in terms of the investigation than we might have initially given it -- it credit for. This actually could cut to significant decisions on the part of -- of Michael Cohen, whether at the -- at then citizen Donald Trump's behest or it not decisions that could lead to questions about his, you know, potential bank fraud or -- or campaign finance issues that could come up. How much that directly affects the president, we don't know that yet and we'll have to learn that in the coming weeks.   BRENNAN: Well, another thing that has personally affected, or at least provoked the president, is this book by James Comey. And the RNC has also taken up this -- this cause of attacking him with these series of ads that play clips from Democrats and Republicans alike criticizing the former FBI director and really not mincing words here.   Ed, were you surprised at this kind of ad or is this just the -- the competition's devolved into name calling at this point.   ED. O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, I don't think it should surprise anyone that they're working as hard as they can to discredit Comey. This is going to be a huge week for him, certainly for his bottom line. The book's number one. It's probably going to remain there for a little while. He launches his incredible national book tour and media tour tonight and, you know --  BRENNAN: We've got six tweets from the president about him today.   O'KEEFE: Right. Which, again, just probably helps things for Comey.   What's telling, though, you look at a new \"Washington Post\"/ABC News poll out this morning. They asked about impressions of Comey. A plurality of people in that survey, 38 percent, have no opinion of him. So there actually is space for the RNC and the president to try to discredit him.   While, at the same time, there are plenty of Democrats out there, as you saw from Tim Kaine, who don't necessarily think totally favorably of him because of the role he played in the 2016 election. And let there be no doubt that there was a role played by him.   So, you know, from a crass political perspective, it probably makes sense to do what you can to discredit him. But, again, I've got to believe all of this will help book sales.   DOMENECH: But -- but, frankly, James Comey is only discrediting himself by some of the decisions he's made with this book. The fact is that there is not a significant news bombshell in this book. Everything that he could have told us news wise has already been leaked, it's already been published. And the biggest headline coming out of it actually have more to do with the petty ways that he refers to the president or that the president referred to him. It's much more sort of high school mean girls-esque burn book than it is anything else.   MARGARET TALEV, \"BLOOMBERG\": And yet I think when you take a look and -- step back and look at the week in totality, until now we've been talking about whether or not the president would take some action to shake the special counsel's investigation. Is Mueller in trouble, be able to keep his job? Is Rob Rosenstein going to get fired?   And with the release of Comey's book and publicity tour, and the case against Michael Cohen that exists outside of Mr. Mueller's channel, you -- what you see, I think, and what may have the president so upset is that even if he could force Mueller out, even if he were to pursue removing Rosenstein, there are these two completely separate channels, one through the justice system and the other through the court of public opinion, where no matter what these questions and the pursuit of this investigation are going to continue. And I think that's part of what has him so rattled.   And the other part of it is, for most American presidents, they're either very old when they leave office or their political career was there their career. And so when they're doing being president, they go back to that legacy.   For President Trump he was a businessman and an image maker for so many years before that whether his presidency ends in 2020 or four years after that, he has that that he has sought to preserve. It's a lot of money and a lot of connections and networks and that is what Jim Comey is shaking right now.   BRENNAN: Margaret, I want to also ask you, though, about the decision to strike in Syria. You heard the U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, say she didn't have time to worry about James Comey and what the president's thinking is on that because she's been so focused on this.   Do we have a sense of what it was like inside this situation room, because it was really the first time that Defense Secretary Mattis was there without his wing man, Rex Tillerson.   TALEV: Yes. And that's a really good point. But what Mattis had this time was the U.K. and France to help temper the president's thinking on this. And I think that is what you saw in terms of the way this strike was measured. In the Middle East, a lot of people were saying, we thought it would be much worse. But, actually, what the president has done here, and part of the reason he may not have gone after equipment, Russian equipment, that sort of thing, is to do a very measured sort of strike that the U.K., France, the international community, most of the U.N. could go along with. And so both in Theresa May and in Mr. Macron, Jim Mattis has found partners with whom to work to help the president make a case for moderation.   BRENNAN: OK. We have so much more to talk about, but we're going to quickly take a break and come back. Take a breath.   We'll be right back.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: And we're back now with our political panel for some analysis on a week we're still reeling from in many ways.   Ben, we haven't even talked about the fact that Speaker Ryan decided on a timeline that surprised many to step away from public life and -- and go home to Wisconsin. The timing surprised many people. What does this do to the horse race?   DOMENECH: Well, in terms of -- in terms of the horse race, I don't think it changed at all that much. It's certainly a sign, though, that Speaker Ryan was not that optimistic that the -- November would be very good for House Republicans. The race to replace him looks to be pretty decidedly in favor of Kevin McCarthy. But that's something that could definitely be for the minority leader position, as opposed to speaker of the House after November.  Ryan leaving is really a tale of a politician who had a moment in time when everyone in Washington thought that he was going to be the next clean cut, wonky leader of the Republican coalition for decades to come.   BRENNAN: You call him a young gun.   DOMENECH: Yes. Well, that's -- that was his branding at the time, along with the -- with the departed Eric Cantor and McCarthy himself.   It was one of those things, though, where I think that Ryan was very much -- as much as he was a significant player in terms of charting the policy future for the GOP in -- from the sort of post-Obama moment on, he was also someone who was out of step, I think, increasingly with the culture warrior mindset of a lot of the Republican base. And his focus on telling stories through histograms and through Excel sheets was not something that actually connected with the Republican base in (INAUDIBLE).  BRENNAN: But is that marketing or is that actually the death of fiscal conservative? I mean you had Bob Corker, the senator out there saying that, you know, this Congress and this administration are going to go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible in history.   DOMENECH: Fiscal --  O'KEEFE: Right.  DOMENECH: Yes, fiscal conservatism, I think, is -- is dead until the point when a Democrats return to the White House. Ed may -- may disagree (ph).  O'KEEFE: Maybe.   I mean, look, he -- he -- he accomplished all he could. And I think he knew that at this point it's only going to get worse for him. Usually in the modern era speakers don't get to leave on their own terms. By doing it now, that far out, he essentially gets to set the table for his departure. And by anointing his preferred successor, sort of leaves it to Republicans to say, you will sort this out later.   But I think he's correct in saying what whoever is in charge of the Republican conference will have no bearing on results in November. And the message he kept sending I think to his colleagues was, get out there and win your race. Do everything you need to do to get reelected. And if you can't do it, well, you know, that's on you.   The head winds are certainly not in the -- you know, they're going against Republicans and it's going to be a bad year for them it looks like if you believe the forecasting. And he knows that. But we should also give him some credit. He's been in Congress for 20 years. He's only 48. So think about that, a 28 year old. All of his kids have been born since he got into Congress. Family considerations were a legitimate part of this. I think, you know, that -- that is -- that is true.   But, again, he gets to do what so few speakers have done in the last 30, 40 years, and that is get out when he can.   BALL: Well, and think -- you did hear some angst -- I heard some angst from some Republicans on The Hill that he was leaving right now and not after the election.   BRENNAN: Right.  BALL: And he was asked about that and he said it would have felt dishonest for him to know he was going to step down. But there was this feeling that he was sort of the general abandoning his troops in the middle of a fight. And so I think that's part of the reason he rushed to anoint McCarthy was to prevent there being a very messy leadership fight in the middle of a very difficult election cycle for Republicans.   And, you know --  BRENNAN: Is it that clean or will the Freedom Caucus have their say in this? Is it -- is Kevin McCarthy, does he have this on lock?   BALL: I don't know. But I think probably so. I think, you know, with Ryan, if Trump goes along with this, and Trump likes McCarthy very much, and we believe that McCarthy is probably Trump's referred speaker. You know, McCarthy had problems last time. There were doubts about his ability to lead. But I think things that have changed a lot since then.   And what was a very difficult job for Paul Ryan might actually be an easier job for McCarthy because we won't have this hamlet act with regard to Trump, right? Ryan was so clearly always fighting his own demons and he was getting asked in every press conference to -- you know, this hand wringing about Trump, it was very clear that he didn't like the guy, but that he had to be allies with the guy. McCarthy's been buddies with Trump from the beginning. And to the extent that, you know, Republican in Congress basically want to do whatever Trump wants them to do, I think that will be much easier for McCarthy to -- to bring them together around that.   DOMENECH: The benefits of being a Californian instead of a Midwesterner.   TALEV: And yet I think, Ed's right, the message -- part of the message that Paul Ryan is sending is, save yourself. Don't wait for the president to save you.  BRENNAN: Are there more Republican departures? I mean -- on the (INAUDIBLE)?  O'KEEFE: We -- we -- I mean there are, what, I think there's 19 states that haven't had their filing deadlines yet. In the wake of the speaker's decision, a guy named Dennis Ross from Florida announced he, too, is retiring. You ask Democrats, they've got a list of about another two dozen that could conceivably do it. We'll see if they do.  You know, Democrats need to come up with 23 seats to retake it. It look like, at this point perhaps they could do that. The question will be whether they get many more after that.   And -- and -- and backfilling retirements, resignations, promotions from Republicans is a big part of their problem. Ryan being \"exhibit a\" at this point. There's, you know, some forecasting now that thinks that his seat is in play.   BRENNAN: Margaret, one of the things that's been uncomfortable for some Senate Republicans, particularly from states that produce agricultural products, the president's announcements on tariff. And this week you had him after this meeting with some senators from those states say, well, let's take another look at the Asia Pacific trade deal that he had already said he was going to exit. They took that as a sign of hope. The president then tweeted the next day a little bit of a walk back.   Is this -- is this just to settle the room? Is this a policy shift? I mean what does the president walk into this meeting with the Japanese prime minister with this week and tell him his position is on TPP?  TALEV: Yes, this is a truly fascinating new turn. The president has hinted for some months that there some was potential in theory to talk about reentering the TPP, but it seemed that he had taken it to a new level this week. He emerged from that meeting with the western leaders. Ben Sasse made it a point to lay down a marker and say, he told Lighthizer and Larry Kudlow, he tapped them to figure out if and how we should reenter the TPP. And I think Sasse put down that marker on purpose to put it out there.   But here's what's happened. The -- getting out of the TPP and the Trans-Pacific Partnership was one of the first things President Trump did in office. The tariff thing has not played well on the stock market and it has not played well with some of Trump voters, some of the Trump base. And this seems to be a testing, a floating of the idea of reentering. Everyone in the TPP says they would welcome the U.S. back, but many in this --  BRENNAN: They don't want to renegotiate it.   TALEV: Many in the TPP says, the terms are set. You guys missed your window. We are not cracking this thing open. But we think it's good for you and good for the rest of the world and good for, to some extent, countering China to have the U.S. back in. And now the president has a real decision to make.   DOMENECH: The president ran in 2016 on a platform that sounded frequently protectionist and isolationist. The fact is that as president his policies have not been as protectionist or isolationist as you might have predicted based on what he was saying at the time. I think this is another example of how he kind of wants to play both sides of these things. He -- he likes the idea of protectionism and tariffs in certain respects, but he really doesn't like the idea of Wall Street's reaction to that.   BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much, to all of you.   We'll be back in a moment to talk about what's next for the U.S. in Syria.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at the situation in Syria with retired Navy Admiral James Winnefeld, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and now a CBS News military and homeland security analyst. Also with us is Ambassador James Jeffrey, the former U.S. envoy to Turkey and Iraq under President George W. Bush and under the Obama administration as well.   Thank you both for coming on the show.   Admiral, this attack in Syria hit three locations. The Pentagon says its set the chemical weapons program back at least a few years. How do you assess its efficacy?   RET. ADM. JAMES WINNEFELD, FORMER JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF VICE CHAIR: Well, first of all, we have to understand that more than anything else this attack was about the international community standing up one more time to prevent the normalization of the use of chemical weapons. Remember, it's not too long ago that the community did this as well when Russia made an assassination attempt in Britain and the -- and many countries ejected Russian diplomats. Well, this is yet another example of that community standing up and pushing back saying we're not going to allow this to happen.   BRENNAN: Do you see that -- would this have happened were it not for what you just described happening in the U.K. with that poisoning of that former Russian agent?   WINNEFELD: Yes, I think it would have happened. And it's a question of how much accumulated misbehavior on the part of Assad regime using chemical weapons is enough to stack up where the international community says, you know, it's time to do something about this. Whether or not it results in Assad not using chemical weapons again is certainly going to be open for debate. We'll see whether that happens. But the important thing is that the community has stood up and said, we are not going to tolerate the normalization of the use of chemical weapons.   BRENNAN: Ambassador, what is the Assad regime take away from this? This is the second time they've been hit by a U.S. strike.   AMB. JAMES JEFFREY, FORMER U.S. ENVOY TO IRAQ AND TURKEY: I think, Margaret, that the assessment on their part is, the Trump administration is concerned about dealing with the symptoms of the underlying problem, the Syrian civil war. And as Nikki Haley mentioned, Iran's expansion into the vacuum, such as ISIS, such as the chemical weapons, but is not going to do very much against the underlying problem that is destabilizing the whole region.   BRENNAN: That sounds a lot like some of the criticism of the Obama administration's strategy in Syria, or (INAUDIBLE)?  JEFFREY: It's very similar. Again, it's dealing with the symptoms. The Trump administration a bit more with military force, which is not a bad thing and could have results at least on the chemical weapons front, but it's not, again, tackling what the problem is. And turning to the Arab states and expecting them to stand up, not just to Iran but to Russia, is no way to get out of this mess.   BRENNAN: Admiral, is there a takeaway that we can learn in terms of how this strike was decided? You know, Aaron David Miller, you know, a long time diplomat, said that the key takeaway is not what happen in Syria but what didn't. That Mattis was able to deescalate.   WINNEFELD: Right. I think --   BRENNAN: Is that your read?  WINNEFELD: It is. And I think that, you know, when you consider that a strike like this really is on the ragged edge of international law. When that happens, it's very important to have a very tight target set and to have a coalition behind you. And that's exactly what happened. And that's one of the reasons why it took a while to get this thing together. It didn't happen a day after the chemical attacks occurred. You not only have to bring the coalition together, you have to very carefully examine the policy implications of what you're about to do. And it was a very, very complex strike that was very well executed. It takes time to get that together.   BRENNAN: And Russia held its fire. What do you make of that?   WINNEFELD: I think Russia understands that they're on the wrong side of history here. They're on a roll.   BRENNAN: Do they? They've been on the right side in terms of who's winning the war for the past seven years.   WINNEFELD: Well, they're on a roll here. They've illegally annexed the Crimea. They've interfered in our elections. They have tried to assassinate somebody in Great Britain. And now they're backing a monster who is using chemical weapons against his own people.   So I think it was -- it was -- the writing was on the wall in the Kremlin. Certainly they're going to push back publicly. No question about it. But I think they realized that even if they could have interfered with the strike, which is debatable, I don't think that they were going to do too much.   BRENNAN: Ambassador, President Trump again, in his announcement of these strikes, reiterated his intent to not stay in Syria. A gesture to bringing those U.S. troops home. But you've said that's actually not a bad decision. What do you think that would mean if you bring those boots who are there, the 2,000 or so, and pull them out?  JEFFREY: Pulling the ground troops out, Margaret, because I think they're doing, at this point, a peripheral mission of dealing with the remnants of ISIS is not a bad idea because Americans are very nervous about this. But Maintaining overall military pressure, no fly zones, action against chemical weapons, essentially what Israel is doing and what Turkey is doing in other parts of Syria would be the building blocks of a real strategy if we could unite everybody behind one.   BRENNAN: You don't see that as vacating the battlefield to Iran?   JEFFREY: No, because I think that we would have to continue to provide, as we did with the Iraqi Kurds after 1991, air cover and some kind of liaison capability so that that terrain becomes denied to Assad and the Iranians.   BRENNAN: And that would require the Trump administration agreeing to protect some of these areas in the south, and they haven't necessarily said they would do that if Assad's forces go into these so-called cease fire zones.   WINNEFELD: True. And I think it's really important to remember that the actual reason why our forces are there in the first place, under international law, and that is to defeat ISIL, not to overthrow the Assad regime or -- or some other ambition. There are probably peripheral sides to that -- that idea, but legally the reason why we're there is collective self-defense with our partners in the region against ISIL.   BRENNAN: Ambassador, in the next few weeks we're going to see a lot of potential flash points. You've got the Iraqi elections. You've also got President Trump needing to make a decision on the Iran nuclear deal. What do you think is going to happen here? I mean can you put those pieces together for us?   JEFFREY: They all circle around a central point, which is, a shift in the geostrategic structure of a critically important region in the Middle East by Iran, enabled by Russia, and helped by its proxies, such as Assad. There's an Iraq aspect to that, a Yemen, and also a nuclear agreement aspect to it. The president wants to pull out of the nuclear agreement. For my money, that's not a good idea. He should focus more on putting together that kind of alliance that can deal across the board with what Iran is doing and then put some military and economic muscle behind what Nikki Haley told you earlier is the Geneva political process. Diplomacy is fine, but as a former diplomat, it doesn't work without pressure.   BRENNAN: All right, ambassador, admiral, thank you very much for joining us.   And we'll be right back.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching.   Next week, in addition to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, John Dickerson, a pretty familiar face here at FACE THE NATION, will be joining us to talk about the cover story he's written for next month's \"Atlantic\" magazine on the presidency.

            "article_content": "President Trump and his lawyers likely won't decide whether he will answer questions from Russia probe investigators until after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un next month, according to the president's legal team. Rudy Giuliani, the president's new attorney, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday that any preparation with Trump for a possible interview with federal investigators would likely be delayed until after the June 12 summit in Singapore because \"I wouldn't want to take his concentration off something far, far more important.\" Giuliani, who also suggested that special counsel Robert Mueller's team had indicated it would not attempt to indict Mr. Trump, said he had hoped to resolve the question of a possible interview by May 17, the one-year anniversary of Mueller's appointment, but that was no longer feasible. \"Several things delayed us, with the primary one being the whole situation with North Korea,\" Giuliani said. \"The president has been very busy. It really would be pretty close to impossible to spend the amount of time on it we would need.\" White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said President Trump is \"somewhat embarrassed\" by the special counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Giuliani later clarified that comment to say \"distracted\" would be a better description. The president's lawyers have not decided whether it would be in Mr. Trump's best interest to sit for an interview. Giuliani warned that it could be a \"perjury trap\" and suggested that \"lies told by others\" could land the president in legal trouble, though he said that Trump himself would not close the door entirely on an interview. \"The president would probably like the resolution,\" the former New York City mayor said. \"If we were convinced it would speed up the process, we may do it. If we believed they would go into it honestly and with an open mind, we would be inclined to do it. But right now, we're not there.\" Mueller's investigation has operated largely in secrecy, with the public getting only glimpses into its operation through witnesses who are questioned or when indictments and guilty pleas are unsealed. But Giuliani suggested that a recent conversation with Mueller's team led him to believe that the special counsel, citing a Justice Department opinion, had ruled out the possibility of trying to indict a sitting president. Mueller has floated the idea of issuing a grand jury subpoena for Mr. Trump to answer questions, former Trump attorney John Dowd has said, though it is unclear how serious prosecutors were about such a move. Even if Mueller's team decided to subpoena Mr. Trump as part of the investigation, the president could still fight it in court or refuse to answer questions by invoking his Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination. Giuliani said Friday that if a subpoena were issued to get Mr. Trump to appear, the president's legal team would oppose it unless they could \"reach agreement on the ground rules.\" He argued that Mr. Trump could invoke executive privilege, and the team would point to Justice Department opinions in fighting a subpoena and \"on both law and the facts, we would have the strongest case you could imagine.\" He noted the handover of 1.2 million documents as evidence of cooperation. He also indicated that the president's lawyers may be \"more likely\" to agree to an interview if Mueller's team narrowed the scope of what it was investigating. Though Giuliani would not provide an exact date for when a determination would be made about the interview, he said it probably \"would be silly to make a decision\" much before the highly anticipated summit. He said that the demands on Trump's time meant that his legal team had \"not done a lot\" in terms of preparing the president for a possible in-person interview. \"It would take a while and he's focused on North Korea,\" said Giuliani. A number of Trump allies, including Vice President Mike Pence this week, have stepped up calls for Mueller's investigation to wrap up, suggesting it was interfering in the president's ability to do the country's business. Mueller's team is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Mr. Trump's associates as well as whether the president obstructed justice. So far, the special counsel's office has charged 19 people \u2014 including four Trump campaign advisers \u2014 and three Russian companies. Both Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, have pleaded guilty and are now cooperating with the probe. A number of other former White House and campaign staffers, including Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, as well as Inauguration Day committee chairman Tom Barrack, have been interviewed. Mr. Trump's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had his office and home raided by federal agents and, this week, was revealed to have been selling his insight into Trump to corporations. Giuliani said the arrangement \"looks bad\" but insisted there was no crime. Giuliani demurred when asked if Mr. Trump would consider it a \"red line\" for his children to be interviewed. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared, Kushner, both worked on the campaign and are senior advisers at the White House, while Trump's adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, were also leading figures on the campaign. Giuliani said he did not expect those interviews with Mueller to take place. \"Our understanding is that he's pretty much finished,\" Giuliani said. \"As far we know, we're basically the last witness.\" The special counsel's office has not outlined the duration of the probe. Some of Mr. Trump's recent tweets revealed the president's anxiety about how the investigation could sway voters as they decide whether to keep congressional Republicans in power or force him to face an aggressive Democratic majority. Giuliani repeated his call for the probe to end soon but suggested that if it lasted until November's midterms, \"it would be helping Republicans.\" \"It makes the campaign feel it it's about impeachment,\" the former mayor said. \"I think the Democrats would be making the same mistake we did back during Clinton.\" In 1998, months after Clinton was impeached, voter backlash cost the Republicans' chance to pick up seats in both Houses of Congress. ___ Associated Press writers Chad Day and Eric Tucker contributed reporting from Washington.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Lanny Davis, an adviser to Michael Cohen, that aired Sunday, Dec. 16, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" Last week President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison. Joining us now is his former attorney Lanny Davis who now because of the sentencing is no longer serving as attorney but as a friend as a spokesperson and counselor. The president tweeted this morning about your former client, \"Remember Michael Cohen only became a rat after the FBI did something that was absolutely unthinkable and unheard of and they broke into an attorney's office.\" What is your response to that? FORMER ATTORNEY TO MICHAEL COHEN LANNY DAVIS: This is the top law enforcement officer in our system of government calling somebody who decides to tell the government the truth, \"A rat.\" That's the language of a mobster not of the president. But Michael Cohen took ownership and personal responsibility for lying and he's going to jail as a consequence and he authorized me, several times, to say he wouldn't take a pardon from Donald Trump if it was handed to him. So he now- MARGARET BRENNAN: Was one ever discussed? DAVIS: Never. But he announced ahead of time, wouldn't take it even if it was handed to him. And let's remember that Michael Cohen has corroborating evidence for everything that he has said. Mr. Mueller certainly does on the issue of the purpose of the money paid to Stormy Daniels the same man who called Michael Cohen a rat denied on Air Force One to the American people that he knew anything about Stormy Daniels and Mr. Giuliani, who this morning was on television accusing Michael Cohen of lying, the very next day waived attorney client privilege and said no his client did pay Stormy Daniels. So Michael Cohen is now taking ownership in his statement to the court of his personal responsibility for his behavior when he worked for Donald Trump. Now that he saw Donald Trump as president he underwent a genuine transformation because he feared for his country and his family When Donald Trump was president. MARGARET BRENNAN: And just quickly to clarify, the president says the FBI broke into his office, I believe Michael Cohen said that it was a okay transaction with the FBI something he consented to. DAVIS: He not only consented to, he thanked them for their courtesy as they left. And you have a president denouncing the FBI, lying about a warrant in a legal search, and he's the top law enforcement officer of the country and who does he praise? He praises his people who have lied and refused to cooperate. The opposite of what a president should do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that Michael Cohen has evidence to back up his allegations here. DAVIS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: In the sentencing memo that the special counsel wrote that he provided useful information concerning Russia related matters core to its investigation. Does that mean- are you saying that Cohen actually has evidence of conspiracy with Russia. DAVIS: So the one thing I can't do, when I was his lawyer and now that I'm his adviser, is to get in front of Mr. Mueller's findings. So I can't answer your question, but I will tell you this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what did you mean by evidence, then? DAVIS: What did Mr. Cohen mean by evidence or Mr. Mueller mean by evidence? I can't tell you anything about what Mr. Mueller meant, let's wait. But I can tell you that when he used the words \"core issues,\" those words are about the Russian investigation. And Mr. Mueller is careful with his words. And he also mentioned that Mr. Cohen provided information regarding the Moscow Trump Tower and that he was contacted by a senior government official and the press secretary to Vladimir Putin. So there's a lot in the Mueller memo that tells you how forthcoming, for 70 hours in seven meetings, Michael Cohen was with Mr. Mueller. MARGARET BRENNAN: Prosecutors also said he provided information concerning contacts with persons connected to the White House during 2017 to 2018. Can you tell us who he was in contact with? DAVIS: Again, I can't tell you. I'll wait for Mr. Mueller to tell you, but just think about it. He publishes ahead of time, which Mr. Mueller criticized him for, his testimony that was a lie about the Moscow Trump Tower. He calls the White House and the president knows from the published testimony that he's about to lie. Not one person from the White House, I can tell you this, ever said, \"don't lie.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he need to be told that? DAVIS: Well, he- guess he did need to be tell- told that because he ended up lying and he was regretted it. And he's going to jail for it. And he said to the court in his heartfelt way, \"I take ownership and I don't blame anybody but myself,\" and apologized for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president's attorney Rudy Giuliani is defending his client and saying that Michael Cohen is just a liar, a serial liar. And he's pointing to the idea that there's no way he was ever loyal to President Trump since he surreptitiously recorded him. DAVIS: So I can see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did he do that? DAVIS: I can see why Mr. Giuliani mentions recordings because he flat out lied when he said that there was no mention of cash by President Trump on the tape recording that I went on CNN to play. It was Mr. Giuliani who lied about- that tape recording is evidence that the primary purpose of the payoff of the hush money to Miss Daniels was the election. It says so on the tape, Mr. Pecker from AMI corroborates it and others will corroborate it. Mr. Giuliani going on the air today ignoring the fact the FEC never ruled that what John Edwards did was appropriate, that's a lie. There was never a ruling. And we'll see what the facts, which is something alien to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump. Let's see what the facts show. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk about what all of this means for the president, thank you.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- The Manhattan District Attorney's office is investigating allegations of violence against women by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned just hours after accounts of abuse by four women. It was a swift and stunning fall for a Democrat who held himself out as a champion of women and a liberal foil to President Trump and who pledged to use his office to hold others accountable for abusing their power. The women described being slapped and choked, verbally abused and threatened by Schneiderman. Some also described him as a heavy drinker. The abuse often happened during what were supposed to be romantic encounters, but the women said the violence was not consensual. Schneiderman, 63, implied in a statement that his conduct was either welcomed by the women, or was not as they described. \"In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in non-consensual sex, which is a line I would not cross,\" he said. Statement from Eric T. Schneiderman: \"In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity.  I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in non-consensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.\" Danny Frost, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement late Monday that prosecutors would look into the claims. It's an unusual twist: Schneiderman's office had been tasked with investigating the Manhattan District Attorney's office over its handling of a 2015 sex assault probe involving Harvey Weinstein that resulted in no criminal charges. The NYPD has told CBS News that they have no complaints on file. They said if they receive complaints of a crime, it will investigate them thoroughly. The state's Solicitor General, Barbara Underwood, will serve as acting Attorney General. She has a long history of legal work including serving in the Eastern District of New York and in the Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens district attorney offices. Schneiderman, a prominent\u00a0#MeToo supporter, capitulated quickly after fellow Democrats in New York, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo and U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, called for his resignation. Schneiderman later issued the following statement: \"It's been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York. In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office's work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.\" Two women who spoke to The New Yorker on the record, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, both said the physical abuse escalated over time. The Associated Press is identifying the women because they agreed to tell their stories publicly. \"After the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not,\" Manning Barish wrote on Twitter after the story was published. Manning Barish said she was involved with Schneiderman from mid-2013 through the end of 2014. Selvaratnam said she was involved with him from the summer of 2016 until fall 2017. Manning Barish said Schneiderman became violent a few weeks after they began dating. She said she confided in friends, including novelist Salman Rushdie. Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, said Schneiderman started calling her his \"brown slave\" and made her say that she was \"his property.\" \"After I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney-General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, who's next, and knew something needed to be done,\" Selvaratnam said in a statement to the AP. Schneiderman has been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement. He filed a lawsuit in February against Weinstein and the Weinstein Co. following an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. Schneiderman said the company broke New York law by failing to protect employees from \"pervasive sexual harassment, intimidation and discrimination.\" He launched a civil rights probe into the New York City-based company in October after The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades. The company later fired Weinstein. The women accusing Schneiderman said seeing him speak out on these issues was part of what prompted them to come forward. The former state senator became attorney general in 2010 and had been running for re-election this year. He also has been a longtime critic of Trump, and has been part of several efforts to push back against some of his actions in the White House, like the rescinding of protection for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Last month, he urged state lawmakers to close a loophole that he said could be used to fight state charges by anyone who has received a federal pardon for similar federal charges. On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr. offered pointed commentary. He showcased one of Schneiderman's tweets from last year saying that he would remind President Trump that no one was above the law, with Trump Jr. adding, \"You were saying-?\" You were saying??? https://t.co/3eyzOml443",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on Tuesday refused to answer a broad array of queries from the House Intelligence Committee about his time working for President Trump, provoking a subpoena from the panel's Republican chairman. The ranking Democrat on the committee, U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), alleged Tuesday that Bannon refusal to answer questions came as an order from the White House.\u00a0 Bannon's interview was closed to the public. Video was captured of Bannon walking toward a vehicle following the hearing, Reuters reports.\u00a0 The development brought to the forefront questions about White House efforts to control what the former adviser tells Congress about his time in Trump's inner circle and whether Republicans on Capitol Hill would force the issue in light of the newly issued subpoena from the GOP-controlled panel.\u00a0 The congressional subpoena came the same day The New York Times reported that Bannon - a former far-right media executive and recently scorned political adversary of the president's - has been subpoenaed by special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before a federal grand jury.\u00a0 With the issuance of Mueller's subpoena, Bannon became the highest-ranking person who served in the Trump White House to be called before a grand jury as part of the special counsel's investigation.  By itself, the move doesn't confirm that Mueller is presenting evidence to support future criminal charges. But it does show that Mueller is still actively using a grand jury as he probes the actions of Trump, his family and his staff during the campaign, presidential transition and the early months of the administration.  Congressional officials declined to say whether Bannon disclosed Mueller's subpoena during an all-day, closed-door interview with members of the House Intelligence Committee.  The members grilled Bannon as part of the committee's investigation into Russian election inference. Lawmakers also wanted answers from him about Trump's thinking when he fired FBI Director James Comey.  But Bannon refused to answer questions about that crucial period, prompting the committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, to issue the subpoena, said Nunes spokesman Jack Langer.\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Jim Hines told CNN that Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the committee's Russia probe, decided \"expansive claim of executive privilege doesn't apply.\"\u00a0 Late Tuesday after the interview concluded, Schiff said Bannon was under a \"gag order by the White House.\" Schiff said the committee plans to call Bannon back for a second interview.\u00a0 Schiff said Bannon's attorney said he would not answer any questions \"concerning any discussions, meetings, conversations, that took place either during the transition or during his time in the administration,\" according to Reuters. A spokeswoman for Bannon did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday afternoon.  At the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said \"no one\" had encouraged Bannon not to be transparent during questioning but there's a \"process of what that looks like.\"  \"As with all congressional inquiries touching upon the White House, Congress must consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material. This is part of a judicially recognized process that goes back decades,\" Sanders told reporters.\u00a0 A White House official said the president did not seek to formally exert executive privilege over Bannon - a move that would have barred him from answering certain questions. The official said the administration believes it doesn't have to invoke the privilege to keep Bannon from answering questions about his time in the White House. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  The House committee had planned to press Bannon on \"executive actions\" taken by Trump that have drawn interest from congressional investigators prying into ties between Trump's campaign and Russian operatives, said another person, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record about the closed-door session and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Those key elements bear directly on the criminal investigation led by Mueller, who is charged with investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether the president obstructed justice by firing Comey or by taking other actions to thwart investigators.  The focus on Bannon follows his spectacular fall from power after being quoted in a book saying that he sees the president's son and others as engaging in \"treasonous\" behavior for taking a meeting with Russians during the 2016 campaign.  In Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury,\" Bannon accuses Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of essentially betraying the nation by meeting with a group of Russian lawyers and lobbyists who they believed were ready to offer \"dirt\" on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  More recently, Bannon has said he was not referring to Trump Jr. but rather to Manafort. Wolff stands by his account.  After the book's release, Trump quickly disavowed \"Sloppy Steve Bannon\" and argued extensively there was no evidence of collusion between his presidential campaign and operatives tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bannon apologized a few days later but was stripped of his job leading the pro-Trump news site Breitbart News.  Bannon last year had largely avoided the scrutiny of congressional investigators, who instead focused much of their energy on trying to secure interviews with top witnesses like Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  But Bannon played a critical role in the campaign, the presidential transition and the White House - all periods of time now under scrutiny from congressional investigators looking for possible evidence of a connection between Trump's operations and Russia.",

            "article_content": "One of President Trump's closest political aides is slated to appear before the House Intelligence Committee to testify behind closed doors in its ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, multiple sources say. White House communications director Hope Hicks was supposed to appear before the committee in January, but her interview was abruptly postponed while counsel for the White House and committee sorted out the scope of her testimony. Hicks' uniquely close and longstanding relationship with President Trump makes her an essential witness to many key moments in the Trump campaign, the transition period, and the presidency. Before she joined his campaign in 2015, Hicks handled public relations for Ivanka Trump at the Trump Organization.\u00a0 The committee will want to question Hicks about any and all contact Trump campaign members might have had with Russian intermediaries. However, one of the most charged issues likely to be addressed is Hicks' knowledge of the White House's initial statement, drafted aboard Air Force One, in response to press reports of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and Trump campaign officials. Committee members will presumably want to probe what role the president himself had in the process \u2013 which is also an area said to be of special interest to special counsel Robert Mueller. Hicks' own role in responding to reports of the meeting may also be scrutinized. According to a report in the New York Times, a former spokesman for President Trump's legal team, Mark Corallo, planned to tell Mueller's team that Hicks said on a conference call that emails written by the President's son, Donald Trump, Jr., about the Trump Tower meeting, \"will never get out.\" In a statement at the time, Hicks' lawyer, Robert P. Trout, strongly denied Corallo's allegation. \"She never said that,\" Trout said, \"And the idea that Hope Hicks ever suggested that emails or other documents would be concealed or destroyed is completely false.\" Hicks has already been questioned by the special counsel and the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of their respective investigations, according to multiple sources. It is still unclear what, if any, limitations the White House may have placed on Hicks' testimony. But the White House and the committee have been at loggerheads on the scope of witness questioning before, with the White House cordoning off any events or topics that took place after the conclusion of the campaign. When former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski appeared before the committee in January, he exasperated committee Democrats by saying he was not prepared to answer questions about the time following his departure from the Trump campaign. Though Lewandowski did not assert executive privilege, and though he has expressed a willingness to return before the committee, his return has not been scheduled, let alone compelled. In the case of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who appeared before the committee once in January and again on February 15, the White House presented the committee with a series of yes-or-no questions that ranking member Adam Schiff, D-California, said were \"literally scripted,\" in such a way that any attempts by the committee to move beyond them drew an unresponsive answer. Bannon told the committee in February that he had been instructed by the White House to invoke executive privilege. \"That is not how executive privilege works \u2013 that's how stonewalling works,\" Schiff said at the time, adding that the only course forward for Congress was to initiate contempt proceedings. As the House makes its return from a week-long recess, it is unclear what, if any, contempt proceedings have begun. While the Republican leading the committee's Russia probe, Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, did not rule out holding Bannon in contempt, he made clear the decision was not entirely in his hands. Following Bannon's appearance on February 15, Conaway said he believed Bannon should answer the committee's questions, but \"contempt is a big deal and I don't have unilateral control over that conversation.\" He indicated he would be consulting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and \"an awful lot of lawyers\" on next steps.",

            "article_content": "In negotiations over a possible interview by prosecutors, special counsel Robert Mueller's team has offered the White House format changes, perhaps willing to limit some questions asked of President Trump or accept some answers in writing, according to a person briefed on the proposal. Talks between Mr. Trump's lawyers and the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election have restarted in recent days, and it is not clear a deal will be struck, according to the person, who spoke Thursday on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Mr. Trump has publicly expressed a desire to be interviewed, but his lawyers have repeatedly objected to the investigators' proposals. Trump attorneys say both sides have exchanged proposals for conditions for such a Trump interview. The negotiations come amid a backdrop of Mr. Trump's escalating attacks on the probe, including his blunt declaration that his attorney general should terminate \"right now\" the federal probe into the campaign that took him to the White House, a newly fervent attack on the special counsel investigation that could imperil his presidency. Mr. Trump also assailed the trial, just underway, of his former campaign chairman by the special counsel's team White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders scrambled to explain that Mr. Trump's tweet Wednesday was \"not an order\" and the president was not directing his attorney general to do anything. \"It's the president's opinion,\" she said. But Mr. Trump's early morning tweetstorm again raised the specter that he could try to more directly bring special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia-Trump election-collusion probe to a premature end. And it revived the idea that the president's tweets themselves might be used as evidence that he is attempting to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has raged privately in recent days that both the forces of government and the media are trying to undermine him. That includes trumped-up charges against his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and distorting the outcome of the Helsinki summit to make it appear he was beholden to Russia, according to two Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak about private conversations. Mr. Trump was closely monitoring news coverage of the Manafort proceedings, which provoked the spate of incendiary tweets, according to the two Republicans and two White House officials. \"The president's not obstructing, he's fighting back,\" said Sanders, dismissing the idea Mr. Trump's tweets could be tantamount to obstruction of justice. The most inflammatory of Mr. Trump's tweets said, \"This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!\" The president's anger came the day after the start of the trial of Manafort, who is facing federal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion. And while Mueller did not bring any election-related charges against Manafort, the specter of the Russian investigation is hanging over the Alexandria, Virginia, courthouse. And Mr. Trump's White House. \"Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders,\" Trump tweeted. \"He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!\" Later the president invoked one of the nation's most notorious criminals, 1920s gangster Al Capone, and posed the question \"who was treated worse\" while airing his grievance about Manafort being held in solitary confinement ahead of a conviction. Manafort is in detention after having his bail revoked because of allegations that he was attempting to tamper with witnesses in his case. Federal prosecutors revealed last month that he was afforded unusual privileges while in detention. Mr. Trump has spent more than a year trying to distance himself from his one-time top political aide, and to minimize the role Manafort played in his campaign. Mr. Trump's protestations aside, Manafort worked on the campaign during a critical six-month period in 2016, during which he led the effort to ensure Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination. He oversaw the early days of the general election effort. Sanders said Mr Trump wants Mueller's investigation concluded swiftly without intervention, though Mr. Trump has publicly mused as recently as May about interfering in the Department of Justice's oversight of the probe. \"At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!\" he tweeted then. Mr. Trump has repeatedly belittled the probe as \"a hoax,\" as those close to him suggest he feels that any talk of Russian interference tarnishes his electoral victory and delegitimizes his presidency. One of the president's confidants deemed Mr. Trump in \"a dark place,\" seething about the longlasting probe and the media's depiction of his White House under siege. Though long antagonistic toward the press, Mr. Trump's anger toward the media has only grown over the past month, as he has berated coverage of his Singapore and Helsinki summits, the possible prosecutorial cooperation of his former legal \"fixer\" Michael Cohen and the Mueller probe. After complaining about the tough questions he received from American reporters in Finland, Mr. Trump has largely steered clear of the mainstream media, instead opting for safer spaces like an interview with ally Rush Limbaugh this week. From the White House briefing room podium on Wednesday, Sanders declined to denounce the harassment of a CNN reporter during a Trump rally in Florida on Tuesday. The president's social media outburst renewed discussion of the significance of his tweets. Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, stressed that Mr. Trump was just issuing an opinion, though he also said the White House believes \"the investigation should be brought to a close.\" \"I guess, if we were playing poker \u2014 we're not \u2014 put up or shut up, what do you got?\" Giuliani said. \"We have every reason to believe they don't have anything.\" When pressed by reporters on how she tells the difference between a presidential order or an opinion, Sanders said Mr. Trump makes his intentions \"pretty clear.\" But the line between registering an opinion or governing by tweet has bedeviled the White House from the start, even when former press secretary Sean Spicer declared tweets could be official White House statements. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump blindsided the Defense Department when he tweeted out a transgender ban for the military, prompting the Pentagon to slow walk the program. Mueller already is interested in some of Mr. Trump's tweets to the extent they raise obstruction of justice concerns. Though experts believe obstruction by tweet is possible, prosecutors have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular act got in the way of an investigation and that the person who did it intended to obstruct. The president's tweets on Wednesday were greeted warily on Capitol Hill, with most lawmakers, regardless of party, urging Mr.\u00a0Trump to let the probe run its course. No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said, \"The idea that they should truncate it doesn't make sense to me.\" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut went much further, declaring. There is now highly credible evidence that the president of the United States is committing obstruction of justice in real time, right before our eyes.\"",

            "article_content": "U.S. Rep. Martha Roby won Alabama's Republican runoff on Tuesday, fighting through lingering fallout from her years-old criticism of then-candidate Donald Trump in a midterm contest that hinged on loyalty to the GOP president. The four-term incumbent will now represent the GOP on the November ballot having defeated Bobby Bright, a former Democrat who tried to cast himself as the more authentic Trump ally in the low-turnout Republican contest. The Trump White House was on Roby's side. \"It's been a true privilege to have the support of the White House through this campaign,\" Roby told cheering supporters, her voice cracking with emotion at times. \"I am so humbled that the people of Alabama's 2nd Congressional District have again placed their trust and their confidence in me.\" Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence endorsed the four-term incumbent in recent weeks. The vice president went further over the weekend and recorded robocalls distributed on her behalf saying she's a reliable vote for the Trump agenda. Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress. My endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the \u201cflood gates\u201d opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. Enjoy! Mr. Trump even congratulated Roby early Wednesday morning, acknowledging that his endorsement for the candidate came \"appropriately late.\" The president also appeared to take credit for a wave of support for Roby, adding \"when it came the 'flood gates' opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. Enjoy!\" Some intervention was required after Roby angered Alabama Republicans in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election when she said Trump's lewd comments about women \u2014 captured on an \"Access Hollywood\" tape \u2014 made him unacceptable as a candidate for president. She spent much of the last two years trying to convince her constituents in Alabama's 2nd Congressional District that she was sufficiently loyal to Trump. Mr. Trump's support did not guarantee a victory, of course, even in a deep-red district that overwhelmingly backed him two years ago. The president has a mixed record this primary season, having backed a handful of Republican candidates in friendly districts who ultimately lost. The most noteworthy, perhaps, was Alabama's own Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who earned the president's strong backing but suffered an embarrassing loss just eight months ago. Voters indicated they were willing to move past Roby's criticism of Mr. Trump. Don Bascom, a retired mechanical engineer who lives in Prattville, said he generally supports the president, but he also shared Roby's concerns about him in 2016. He voted for the congresswoman on Tuesday. \"I think she has done a good job. She's an incumbent so to some degree she's proven herself,\" he said. \"One of the criticisms I've heard of her is that she simply couldn't vote for Trump when he ran, and to be honest, I couldn't either because of the way he treats people.\" Deborah Gilliam, a registered nurse from Millbrook, said she too was bothered by Roby's comments about Trump, but she ultimately voted for her. She said she felt uneasy with Bright's party switch. \"It was a toss-up,\" Gilliam said. \"I'll give her one more chance.\" Roby faced the runoff test because she earned only 39 percent of the vote in the first primary contest back in June. Bright was the second-place finisher. Despite her past criticism of Mr. Trump, the White House eventually emerged as Roby's most powerful backer. Mr. Trump called Roby a \"reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda\" on Twitter and bashed Bright as \"a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat.\" The president was referring to Bright's support of Pelosi's bid to become House speaker when he was a Democrat in Congress. Roby made clear she would return the favor should she win re-election in November, as widely expected in heavily Republican state. She'll face Democrat Tabitha Isner, a political newcomer. \"It has been a great privilege to be a part of the conservative momentum and to work alongside my colleagues in Congress and the Trump administration,\" Roby told supporters Tuesday night. \"I am ready to continue the fight.\"",

            "article_content": "Increasingly convinced that the West Wing is wholly unprepared to handle the expected assault from Democrats if they win the House in November, President Donald Trump's aides and allies are privately raising alarm as his circle of legal and communications advisers continues to shrink. With vacancies abounding in the White House and more departures on the horizon, there is growing concern among Trump allies that the brain drain at the center of the administration could hardly come at a more perilous time. Special counsel Robert Mueller's swirling probe of Russian election interference and potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump has reached ever closer to the Oval Office, and the upcoming midterm elections could grant his political adversaries the power of subpoena or, more worryingly, the votes to attempt impeachment. Nine current and former White House staffers and administration allies expressed concerns Thursday that the West Wing is simply unprepared for the potential troubles ahead. They spoke on the condition of anonymity over concerns about estranging colleagues. Attrition, job changes and firings have taken their toll across the White House, but their impact has been felt particularly in the communications and legal shops \u2014 two departments crucial to Mr. Trump staving off the looming threats. The upcoming departure of White House counsel Don McGahn has highlighted the challenges in an office that has shrunk by a third since last year. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, went so far as to tweet he hopes it isn't true McGahn is leaving, recognizing the hole that would leave in the White House. \"U can't let that happen,\" Grassley tweeted to Mr. Trump earlier this week.\u00a0 McGahn's deputy and chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, is also expected to leave soon after McGahn departs, two staffers said. Similarly, the White House press office is down to four press secretaries working on day-to-day White House matters, including Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and the regional and Cabinet affairs media teams in the communications office have been hollowed out. CBS News reported on Thursday that White House ethics lawyer Stefan Passantino, who has helped staffers with financial disclosure forms and ethics questions, is leaving this week, too.\u00a0 The staffing shortage and struggles to recruit top-flight talent have left the White House ill-prepared to handle the legal onslaught that may come when Mueller issues an expected report summarizing his findings and the flood of congressional investigations that could follow a Democratic takeover of the House. CBS News polling shows Democrats are more likely to seize the House than not.\u00a0 Former Fox News executive Bill Shine, who joined the White House earlier this summer as communications director and deputy chief of staff, is looking to rebuild a shrunken media affairs team in anticipation of the challenges ahead. Shine is said to be looking for seasoned communications professionals to handle both Mueller-related questions and congressional oversight requests. \"He's doing a lot of thinking about how to properly structure everything, not only for a Trump White House but for what the next couple of years will be like,\" said former White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But like other White House departments, the effort to fill jobs is proving difficult. Qualified candidates are steering clear of the volatile West Wing, ignoring pleas from Shine and others to join the administration over fears to their reputation and even potential legal exposure, according to current and former officials and one candidate approached by the White House. Those people and others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations and conversations. Others are wary of joining the team to defend the president, knowing full well he will often ignore their advice or could turn on them by tweet. A White House official disputed that the administration has had difficulty filling positions with talented people. Mr. Trump's allies have long boasted that he was his own political consultant during the 2016 campaign and serves as his own communications director inside the White House, but they are increasingly cautioning him that he can't be his own attorney as well. Indeed, his outside legal team reached out to some of Washington's most prominent attorneys, including Supreme Court litigator Ted Olson, before former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani \u2014 a longtime friend of the president whose erratic television interviews have defined his tenure \u2014 joined the team in April. Since then, Giuliani has been the primary public face of the defense team, along with Jay Sekulow, a lawyer specializing in constitutional law and religious liberties. A husband-wife duo, Martin and Jane Raskin, was also added to work behind the scenes. At the same time, the president is more unpredictable than ever, creating new challenges for both his communication and legal teams. Mr. Trump built much of his professional empire on a foundation of secrecy, enforced by fixers, lawyers, hush payments and non-disclosure agreements. Seeing that world collapse around him in recent weeks has yielded intense frustration in the president, who has angrily told confidants that he feels betrayed by a number of former allies, including attorney Michael Cohen and National Enquirer head David Pecker. Mr. Trump has denounced the \"sweetheart deal\" received by Cohen, fumed about the overzealous prosecution of former campaign chair Paul Manafort and seethed over the pressure on Pecker to agree to an immunity deal, according to two Republicans close to the White House but not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. The president signaled Thursday that he has settled on a successor for McGahn. \"I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Councel!\" Trump tweeted Thursday. He sent a later tweet that spelled \"counsel\" correctly.\u00a0 Trump also took a shot at reports that McGahn had threatened to resign last year if the president continued to press for Mueller's removal. \"I liked Don, but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much Fake Reporting and Fake News!\" Trump said, referring as well to his attorney general, who recused himself from the investigation, much to the president's annoyance. The president also mentioned his \"decision\" about McGahn, although a White House official clarified to CBS News that Mr. Trump was referring to his decision to accept McGahn's resignation.\u00a0 The widely expected pick to replace McGahn is White House is attorney Emmet Flood, who joined Mr. Trump's White House in May as in-house counsel for the Mueller probe and has McGahn's support in taking the role. Praise for Flood, a veteran attorney who defended Bill Clinton during his impeachment process and represented George W. Bush in executive-privilege disputes with Congress, poured in Thursday. \"His reputation is stellar and he brings the requisite skillset and pretty much unmatched experience, having been in both the Bush and Clinton White Houses and now serving in President Trump's counsel's office,\" said Mark Corallo, a former spokesman for the president's outside legal team. \"You couldn't ask for a more qualified and better-prepared attorney.\" \"I think Flood of all people seems to have clearly the experience that would be required if indeed it's needed,\" said Spicer. If the Democrats take the House, the president is expected to face not only possible impeachment hearings, but a bombardment of congressional subpoenas, inquires and hearings that Democrats hope will hobble his administration \u2014 giving it little room to do much else. \"At that point,\" said Corallo, \"the president's going to need some very skilled attorneys\" \u2014 Constitutional scholars who are familiar with the past impeachments of Clinton and former President Andrew Johnson, have dozens of Supreme Court arguments under their belt, are highly respected and understand the mechanics and the politics of impeachment hearings. But others were less concerned. \"Everybody wants to make sure he gets the best advice,\" former campaign adviser Barry Bennett said of the president. \"But battling is something he's very good at, so he's got some home turf advantage.\" Mr. Trump, too, dismissed the chatter in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg News. \"I don't think they can impeach somebody that's doing a great job,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Federal prosecutors said in a court filing Friday that the criminal probe that led them to raid the offices of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is focused on the attorney's \"personal business dealings\" and has been going on for months. In the filing with a court in New York, prosecutors blacked out a section describing what laws they believe Cohen has broken, but they said the \"crimes being investigated involve acts of concealment\" and suspected fraud. They also made clear that investigators have been gathering extensive evidence for some time as part of an ongoing grand jury investigation. Agents, they wrote, had already searched multiple email accounts maintained by Cohen after securing an earlier search warrant. None of those emails, they added, was exchanged with Mr. Trump. In a footnote, the prosecutors wrote that although the investigation was referred to prosecutors in New York by special counsel Robert Mueller, it was proceeding independently. The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan made the filing after lawyers for Cohen and Mr. Trump asked a judge to block the Justice Department from reviewing records seized Monday in FBI raids on Cohen's apartment, hotel room, office and safety deposit box. In a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, Cohen's lawyers asked to examine the seized documents and electronic devices. The lawyers said they should be allowed to identify which of the documents are protected by attorney-client privilege before prosecutors get to look at them. Michael Avenatti, who represents Stormy Daniels, spoke outside the courtroom. \"Clearly Michael Cohen was his longtime attorney and effectively knows where all of the bodies are buried as they say, and I think that in the event that Michael Cohen is ultimately charged that that could pose significant and very, very serious problems for the president of the United States.\" An attorney for the president, Joanna Hendon, appeared as well, telling the judge that Mr. Trump has \"an acute interest in these proceedings and the manner in which these materials are reviewed.\" \"He is the president of the United States,\" she said. \"This is of most concern to him. I think the public is a close second. And anyone who has ever hired a lawyer a close third.\" But Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom McKay told the judge that he believed the proceedings were an attempt to delay the processing of materials seized in the search. \"The issues here are straightforward,\" he said. Of Mr. Trump, McKay said: \"His attorney-client privilege is no greater than any other person who seeks legal advice.\" Federal agents seized records on a variety of subjects in raids Monday on Cohen's Manhattan office, apartment and hotel room, including payments that were made in 2016 to women who might have damaging information about Mr. Trump. The raid was authorized by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. On Monday evening, Mr. Trump called the raid \"a disgraceful situation and a \"total witch hunt.\"\u00a0 \"Here we are talking about Syria ... and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over twelve months,\" Mr. Trump said, describing the raid as as an attack on the country and on \"what we all stand for ... a whole new level of unfairness.\" The court hearing Friday didn't provide new insight into why agents seized the items, but the judge, prosecutors and the attorneys all spoke openly about an investigation that previously has been shrouded in secrecy. FBI and Justice Department officials have refused to say what crimes they are investigating, but people familiar with the investigation have told The Associated Press the search warrant used in the raids sought bank records, business records on Cohen's dealing in the taxi industry, Cohen's communications with the Trump campaign and information on payments made to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and a porn actress, Stephanie Clifford, who performs under the name Stormy Daniels. Both women say they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Ordinarily, documents or communications seized from a lawyer by FBI agents would be reviewed by a team of Justice Department lawyers not directly involved in the investigation to determine which documents were relevant to the probe, and which should be off-limits to investigators because of attorney-client privilege. The judge said prosecutors believed either a special \"taint team\" of government lawyers should decide what evidence can be properly viewed by criminal prosecutors. Or, they said, the court could appoint a special master for that purpose. Hendon asked for a delay in court proceedings until at least Monday, saying she needed to research the law. Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, was in the audience for the court session and asked the judge to be heard at 2 p.m. \"We have every reason to believe that some of the documents seized relate to my client,\" he said. Cohen has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Trump has called the raids a \"witch hunt,\" \u2033an attack on our country,\" and a violation of rules that ordinarily make attorney client communications confidential. Those confidentiality rules can be set aside under certain circumstances if investigators have evidence that a crime has been committed. Public corruption prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan are trying to determine, according to one person familiar with the investigation, if there was any fraud related to payments to McDougal and Clifford. McDougal was paid $150,000 in the summer of 2016 by the parent company of the National Enquirer under an agreement that gave it the exclusive rights to her story, which it never published. Cohen said he paid Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her silence about her claim to have had a one-night-stand with Trump. The White House has consistently said Mr. Trump denies either affair.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon's attorney relayed questions to the White House during a House Intelligence Committee interview of the former Trump chief strategist, CBS News has confirmed.\u00a0 During the day-long interview Tuesday, Bannon's attorney Bill Burck was asking the White House counsel's office by phone whether his client could answer the questions. He was told by that office not to discuss his work on the transition or in the White House. Two sources have confirmed to CBS News' Margaret Brennan that the calls were not made from the interview room during the Tuesday testimony \u2014 rather, Bannon's attorney stepped out to consult with the White House.\u00a0 That comes after the Associated Press reported the questions relayed to the White House in real time, which CBS News has learned is not the correct characterization, according to two sources. A source close to Bannon also told CBS News that Bannon's lawyer related topics about the transition and administration to the White House, and they told him that he was not authorized to answer questions on those topics unless the committee reached an accommodation with the White House on the proper scope of questioning.\u00a0 It's unclear who Burck communicated with or whether it was top White House lawyer Don McGahn. Burk is also representing McGahn in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, said on Fox News Wednesday the White House shouldn't exert executive privilege, and said Bannon began to answer one question before halting. Bannon began to address the comment he reportedly made that was published in Michale Wolff's \"Fire and Fury: Inside Trump's White House,\" claiming Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer was \"treasonous.\" \"He answered it initially and then apparently his lawyer didn't like the fact that he answered it, and then he clammed up,\" Gowdy said.\u00a0 Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the committee, confirmed the interaction with the White House when he spoke with reporters following the interview Tuesday night. Schiff said Bannon was served with a subpoena during the course of the interview, and his counsel then conferred with the White House and was instructed by the White House to refuse again to answer any questions. Bannon's interview marked a significant point as the committee continues its investigation into Russian election meddling any any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. Bannon was already interviews by Mueller's special counsel, which is conducting a separate investigation.\u00a0 President Trump has publicly split with his former chief strategist since Bannon left the White House last summer. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump issued a scathing statement saying that Bannon not only lost his job but \"lost his mind,\" compelling other Trump allies to also part ways with Bannon. Bannon left his role as executive chairman at Breitbart News.\u00a0 CBS News' Alan He and Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "White House communications director Hope Hicks will resign, the White House confirmed Wednesday afternoon. The New York Times first reported her impending departure -- it is unclear when exactly she will leave, although it will be soon. \"There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump,\" Hicks said in a statement. \"I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.\" Hicks' departure comes a day after she testified before the House Intelligence Committee, and a day after it was reported that White House deputy communications director Josh Raffel is leaving the White House. Hicks, 29, has been a central piece of the Trump operation since the beginning of the presidential campaign. Hicks entered the Trump campaign with no real political experience. Her family was friends with the Trumps, and she was once a model for Ralph Lauren. But her ability to navigate the unpredictability that comes with being a part of the Trump orbit made her one of the president's closest confidantes. Mr. Trump said he will \"miss having her by my side.\" \"Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person,\" the president said in a statement. \"I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future.\" Hicks' proximity to Mr. Trump has made her of particular interest to special counsel Robert Mueller and the congressional intelligence committees as they investigate Russian election meddling and any ties to Trump associates. Hicks provided limited information to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, when she sat before the committee for nine hours. Ranking member Adam Schiff, D-California, said Hicks' refusal to answer the committee's questions about her time in the White House made for \"a breathtakingly broad claim of privilege that I don't think any court would sustain, and I think the White House knows that.\" The media-shy Hicks was thrust into the spotlight last month after allegations surfaced that then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter had abused his ex-wives. Hicks, at the time, was dating Porter, and was involved in crafting an initial statement defending him. But as photos of the alleged abuse emerged, scrutiny on Hicks and White House chief of staff John Kelly intensified, and Porter resigned. Hicks is the fourth White House communications director to leave the post in barely a year. Her predecessors included Sean Spicer, Anthony Scaramucci and Michael Dubke. It's unclear at this point who will be the next communications director. It's likely an interim communications director will be selected in the meantime. While Mr. Trump said she is turning to other opportunities, it's unclear what that will be. The White House did not say.

            "article_content": "The FBI raided the home and office of President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen\u00a0on Monday, seizing materials and documents including content related to his payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that law enforcement agents conducted searches Monday at his New York office and the New York residence of Mr. Trump's long-time attorney. A court warrant authorizing the raid was obtained. It is unclear what investigation the raid stems from. CBS News' Paula Reid reports that this evidence was seized as part on an investigation into possible campaign finance violations and fraudulent business activity, according to a person familiar with the case. Further, the client communications seized included communications with Mr. Trump. Approval to give the information uncovered by special counsel to the U.S. attorney in New York City would likely have been approved by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Reid reports. The Justice Department declined to comment on Rosenstein's involvement. Cohen's attorney, Stephen Ryan, released a statement confirming the search, saying, \"Today the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients. I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.\" According to a knowledgeable official, the information used in Monday's raid originated with the special counsel but is a separate inquiry, CBS News' Andres Triay reports. Ryan went on to call the U.S. attorney's use of search warrants \"completely inappropriate and unnecessary.\" \"It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients,\" his statement continued. \"These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.\" Not all of Cohen's communications with President Trump would be protected by attorney-client privilege, Reid also reports, citing a former Justice Department official. Anything not related to seeking or receiving legal advice would be fair game, subject to the approval of a judge. Mr. Trump said Monday evening that he had \"just heard\" that the office of one of his personal attorneys was broken into, a reference to the FBI raid of Cohen's office. During a meeting with his military advisers at the White House, he called it \"a disgraceful situation\" and \"a total witch hunt.\" \"Here we are talking about Syria..and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over twelve months,\" Mr. Trump said, describing the raid as as an attack on the country and on \"what we all stand for...a whole new level of unfairness.\" He called the Mueller team \"the most biased group of people with the biggest conflicts of interest I've ever seen\" and complained that the special counsel was not investigating Hillary Clinton. The president also said Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"made a very terrible mistake for the country\" when he recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The president added that, had he known Sessions would recuse himself, \"we would have put a different attorney general in.\" \"The other side is where there are crimes,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to Clinton and the Democrats. When asked why he doesn't just fire Mueller, Mr. Trump said, \"Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens...many people have said you should fire him. Again, they found nothing.\" \"It's a pure and simple witch hunt,\" Mr. Trump said. The Justice Department did not comment on the president's renewed attacks on Sessions Monday evening. The New York Times first\u00a0reported the raid of Cohen's office Monday. Mueller's office declined to comment on the raid. Agents arrived at 9:15 a.m. at the 30 Rockefeller Center offices of Squire Patton Boggs, where Cohen had until recently been working, CBS News' Laura Strickler reports, according to a source familiar with the search. The firm was expecting the FBI -- two or three agents at first, without FBI jackets. A few others arrived later -- they were not FBI agents. They inconspicuously searched Cohen's office space over the course of a few hours. Squire Patton Boggs and Cohen announced last April that they had formed a \"strategic alliance.\" Cohen was helping Squire Patton Boggs land new clients, Politico reported in September 2017. The firm told Strickler Monday that its arrangement with Cohen had ended, in accordance with their agreement but also said in a statement from Angelo Kakolyris, of Squire Patton Boggs' New York office, \"We have been in contact with Federal authorities regarding their execution of a warrant relating to Mr. Cohen. These activities do not relate to the firm and we are in full cooperation.\" The Times reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained the search warrant after the special counsel in the Russia probe, Robert Mueller, sent a referral. The Times said that the search \"does not appear to be directly related to Mr. Mueller's investigation, but likely resulted from information he had uncovered and gave\" to New York prosecutors. Cohen has admitted paying Clifford -- whose stage name is Stormy Daniels -- $130,000 after she said she had an affair with President Trump over a decade ago. The Times also reported that Ryan said that Cohen has cooperated with authorities and turned over documents to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The FBI also took Cohen's emails, tax documents and business records from his office, The Times reported, citing a person familiar with the search.

            "article_content": "President Trump said Wednesday that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's replacement will come from a list of 25 possible nominees that was released by the White House in November. Kennedy announced his retirement\u00a0Wednesday, saying he will step down effective July 31. One of the possible nominees, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, tells CBS News he would \"of course\" accept an offer to serve on the high court. Mr. Trump released a list of 11 potential nominees after securing the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, one that was heavily influenced by the conservative Heritage Foundation. His campaign expanded the list in the fall of 2016, and it eventually grew to the list of 25 names released last year. CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett anticipates that the White House will be put forth a nominee within a week or two at most. \"As soon as the nominee is announced, the confirmation process will begin,\" Garrett reports. \"And you can be absolutely certain there will be a confirmation vote before the midterm elections to fill the seat ... just made vacant by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy.\"\u00a0 Speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would act quickly to vote on the eventual nominee. At the White House, Mr. Trump said he found out about Kennedy's retirement a half-hour before it was announced on Wednesday. Kennedy went to the White House to talk to Mr. Trump for about 30 minutes, and Kennedy offered recommendations about who might replace him, the president told reporters during a meeting with the president of Portugal. Mr. Trump did not answer questions about who Kennedy recommended. In a letter addressed to Mr. Trump Wednesday about his decision, Kennedy called it the \"highest of honors to serve on this Court\" and expressed his \"profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know, interpret, and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises.\" Kennedy's retirement gives Mr. Trump his second Supreme Court pick and the chance to swing the balance of the court to conservatives. Here's the list of potential nominees released by the White House last November:",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump was so incensed by the FBI's raid of his personal attorney's office and hotel room that he's privately pondered firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and publicly mused about ousting special counsel Robert Mueller. The raid, in which agents seized attorney Michael Cohen's records on topics including a $130,000 payment to a porn actress who alleges she had sex with Mr. Trump, left the president more angry than advisers had seen him in weeks, according to five people familiar with the president's views but not authorized to discuss them publicly. \u00a0Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday that \"Attorney-client privilege is dead!\" Nervous White House aides expressed new fears about the president's unpredictability in the face of the Cohen raid, which he viewed as an assault on a longtime defender and a sign that Mueller's probe into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign was \"going too far.\" \u00a0Mr. Trump also announced Tuesday he was cancelling plans to attend the Summit of the Americas over the weekend as well as an overnight visit to Colombia. The president had been telling confidants for weeks that he was not eager to make the three-day trip, which had already been shortened from original plans, according to two people who have discussed it with him in recent weeks but were not authorized to disclose the private conversations. His decision not to travel was publicly tied to the need to monitor the situation in Syria, but privately Mr. Trump said he didn't want to be away from the White House amid developments in the China trade dispute and in the Mueller investigation. Mr. Trump also expressed confidence in the loyalty displayed by Cohen, his longtime personal and professional fixer, who ascended to one of the most powerful roles at the Trump Organization not filled by a family member. Cohen has steadfastly denied wrongdoing in his $130,000 payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and has publicly defended \u00a0Mr. Trump, but he has confided in associates that he is fearful of being a fall guy, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions. Cohen has said he took out a personal line of credit on his home to pay Daniels days before the 2016 election and without Mr. Trump's knowledge. The raid of his office was overseen by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and based in part on a referral from Mueller. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made clear that White House officials have explored Mr.\u00a0 Trump's authority to fire Mueller. \"He certainly believes that he has the power to do so,\" she said at Tuesday's press briefing. Under Justice Department regulations, only Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia investigation, can fire Mueller. On Capitol Hill, a bipartisan group of four senators moved to protect Mueller's job. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey planned to introduce legislation Wednesday that would give any special counsel a 10-day window in which he or she could seek expedited judicial review of a firing, according to two people familiar with the legislation. They were not authorized to discuss the bill ahead of its release and requested anonymity. \u00a0Mr. Trump spent Monday evening calling associates to vent and gauge their reaction to the news. He bitterly complained that the raids were meant to ruin Cohen's life and expressed frustration that it was another front from which to attack his presidency, according to a person familiar with the conversations but not permitted to discuss them publicly. Mr. Trump also revived his broadsides on Rosenstein as well as Rosenstein's boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom he belittled to confidants for recusing himself from the investigation and, in turn, delivering him to Mueller. The White House insisted \u00a0Mr. Trump was focused on the response to Syria following the country's apparent use of chemical weapons on civilians over the weekend, killing more than 40 people. A military strike would mark \u00a0Mr. Trump's second retaliatory strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad's government at a time when Mr.\u00a0 Trump is seeking to reduce the U.S. footprint in Syria. The discussions come as Mr.\u00a0 Trump's newest national security adviser, John Bolton, stepped into the job this week. He encouraged \u00a0Mr. Trump to skip the trip to South America to manage the Syria strategy. Bolton, a seasoned bureaucratic operator, has been expected to put his stamp on the National Security Council staff. NSC spokesman Michael Anton resigned over the weekend, with two people familiar with the situation saying Anton resigned after learning he would be fired. Mr.\u00a0 Trump's homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, exited Tuesday. Bossert had overseen the administration's response to the 2017 hurricane season and was credited by his colleagues for leading the administration's efforts to bolster cybersecurity resiliency across government and private industry. Asked if Bolton forced Bossert out, Sanders said: \"I'm not going to get into specific details about the ongoings of personnel, but I can tell you that he resigned. The president feels he's done a great job and wishes him the best.\" The mood at the NSC this week was described as grim, with aides fearful over Bolton's plans. More senior-level departures are expected in the coming weeks, said two people familiar with the dynamic but not authorized to discuss it publicly. \u00a0Mr. Trump's administration has set records for turnover in his 15 months in office at all levels, with Bossert marking at least the 13th official who held the rank of assistant to the president at the start of the administration to depart. There is growing concern in Mr.\u00a0 Trump's orbit that the turmoil will only continue following the release next week of former FBI director James Comey's book, which promises to reveal new details about his conversations with the president and the Russia probe. An administration official said the White House would largely defer to outside surrogates to push back on Comey, but there was concern as to how the director's interviews could rile up the president.",

            "article_content": "White House communications director Hope Hicks spent nine hours testifying Tuesday behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee, a month after her initial appearance was abruptly postponed. Like at least two other witnesses before her -- including former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon -- Hicks initially relegated her testimony solely to events that took place during the campaign and refused to answer questions related to the transition or her time in the White House. Later in the afternoon, after it was revealed she had addressed some transition matters in an earlier, separate interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Hicks slightly broadened her testimony to answer \"some\" questions related to the transition, members said. In remarks at the conclusion of the committee's interview, ranking member Adam Schiff, D-California, said Hicks' refusal to answer questions constituted \"a breathtakingly broad claim of privilege that I don't think any court would sustain, and I think the White House knows that.\" \"This is not executive privilege, this is executive stonewalling,\" he said. Schiff said all of the committee's questions related to the drafting of a statement about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting \"went unanswered,\" and that he believed Hicks' responses to them should be compelled by subpoena. He said the minority moved, as it did in Bannon's case, to subpoena some of Hicks' testimony \"on the spot,\" but that the majority declined to do so. Earlier in the day, Rep. Denny Heck, D-Washington, summed up the testimony in three words: \"We got\u00a0Bannoned.\" Republicans expressed few reservations about what questions Hicks did not answer. \"I think she's been here for the last eight hours and she's answered questions for those eight hours based on the four parameters that our committee has laid out,\" said Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Florida, \"and I think that she's been forthright and open to all the questions that we've had.\" \"She's answered every possible question on the campaign,\" said Rep. Peter King, R-New York. A source familiar with Hicks' testimony tells CBS News she did answer a question about whether she had ever lied for Mr. Trump by saying she has told \"white lies\" for him at times.\u00a0The New York Times was first to report\u00a0the details of Hicks' response. The source confirmed Hicks also said she never lied about anything material to the ongoing Russia investigation. \u00a0 Bannon's refusal to answer the committee's questions beyond a list of 25 questions that was \"literally scripted\" by the White House, according to earlier remarks by Schiff, prompted a call by committee Republicans and Democrats alike to hold Bannon in contempt of Congress. That possibility did not arise in the aftermath of Lewandowski's testimony, during which he said he was not prepared to answer questions beyond the campaign. It is even less clear that it will be considered in Hicks' case. \"We'll cross that Rubicon when we get to it,\" said the Republican leading the Russia probe, Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, who also said he had not yet spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan about initiating contempt proceedings for Bannon. It was not immediately clear what next steps the committee as a whole was prepared to take in its ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. In order to bring the investigation to a credible close, Schiff said, the minority wanted to review more documents and bring in -- or, as in the cases of Hicks, Bannon and Lewandowski -- bring back more witnesses. Meanwhile, Republicans expressed an eagerness to wrap the matter up soon. Asked what steps the majority intended to take next in the investigation, Rep. Rooney said, \"Hopefully that we write a report based on the year-long investigation that we've done with the scores of witnesses that we've interviewed over the last year.\" But when asked if that meant the investigation would soon be brought to a close, Rooney said, \"I hope so -- but I doubt it.\"",

Wilkie is Mr. Trump's third pick for the job in 18 months. The longtime public official says he will \"shake up complacency\" at VA, which has struggled with long waits in providing medical treatment to millions of veterans. Mr. Trump selected Wilkie for the post in May after firing his first VA secretary, David Shulkin, amid ethics charges and internal rebellion at the department over the role of private care for veterans. Mr. Trump's initial replacement choice, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, withdrew after allegations of workplace misconduct surfaced. Wilkie, a former assistant secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, has received mostly positive reviews from veterans' groups for his management experience, but the extent of his willingness to expand private care as an alternative to government-run VA care remains largely unknown. Mr. Trump last year pledged he would triple the number of veterans \"seeing the doctor of their choice.\" Currently more than 30 percent of VA appointments are made in the private sector. Under repeated questioning at his hearing, the Air Force and Navy veteran said he opposed privatizing the agency of 360,000 employees and would make sure VA health care is \"fully funded.\" When pressed by Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the panel, if he would be willing to disagree with Mr. Trump, Wilkie responded \"yes.\" \"I have been privileged to work for some of the most high-powered people in this town,\" said Wilkie, currently a Pentagon undersecretary for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. \"They pay me for their opinions, and I give those to them.\" Wilkie's main task in the coming months will be carrying out a newly signed law to ease access to private health providers. That law gives the VA secretary wide authority to decide when veterans can bypass the VA, based on whether they receive \"quality\" care, but the program could face escalating costs. Some Democrats have warned the VA won't be able to handle a growing price tag, putting it at risk of budget shortfalls next year. Major veterans' groups want full funding for core VA medical centers, which they see as best-suited to veterans' specialized needs such as treatment for post-traumatic stress. As VA secretary, Wilkie also will have more power under a new accountability law to fire VA employees. Lawmakers from both parties have recently raised questions about the law's implementation, including how whistleblower complaints are handled and whether the law is being disproportionately used against rank-and-file employees rather than senior managers who set policy. \"The tone has been set by President Trump on the direction of VA reforms,\" said Dan Caldwell, executive director of the conservative Concerned Veterans for America. \"There have been a tremendous number of bills passed in the last year and half, and all will require a lot of work to make sure they are properly implemented.\" Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, praised Wilkie as \"eminently qualified,\" saying he will \"bring stability and leadership\" to VA. Wilkie served as acting VA secretary after Shulkin's firing in March, before returning to his role as Pentagon undersecretary. He will replace current acting VA secretary Peter O'Rourke, who clashed with the VA inspector general after refusing to release documents relating to VA whistleblower complaints and casting the independent watchdog as an underling who must \"act accordingly.\" Under pressure from Congress, the VA agreed last week to provide documents to the IG.",

            "article_content": "Lawyers for President Trump unleashed a blistering attack on former FBI Director James Comey in a confidential memo last year to the special counsel, casting him as \"Machiavellian,\" dishonest and \"unbounded by law and regulation\" as they sought to undermine the credibility of a law enforcement leader they see as a critical witness against the president. The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, provides a window into the formation of a legal strategy currently used by Mr. Trump's lawyers as they seek to pit the president's word against that of the former FBI director. Comey's firing in May 2017 helped set in motion the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, and one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump that Comey documented in a series of memos helped form the basis of Mueller's inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice. Mueller is looking broadly into Russia's meddling in the U.S. election and its contacts with people in Mr. Trump's campaign. The June 27, 2017, letter was written by Marc Kasowitz, then the president's lead lawyer, as Mueller and his team were in the early stages of their investigation into Trump associates and as they had begun examining whether the president, by firing Comey, had sought to stymie an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. The White House initially pointed as justification for the firing to a Justice Department memo that faulted Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, though Mr. Trump later said that \"this Russia thing\" was on his mind when he made the move. The document also could have new relevance in the aftermath of a Justice Department inspector general report that criticized Comey for departing from established protocol in the Clinton investigation. It's not clear to what extent, if any, the attacks on Comey have resonated with Mueller's team, which continues to seek an interview with the president on whether he had a corrupt intent when he fired the FBI director. And even in the face of withering criticism, Comey has been largely consistent in his telling of his interactions with Mr. Trump in his memos, his book and numerous press interviews he's given in recent months. The 13-page document aims to identify for Mueller what the lawyers believe are grievous errors both in how Comey handled the Clinton investigation and in his early, and limited, encounters with the president. In it, Kasowitz argues that Comey cannot be trusted as a witness because he repeatedly embellished his testimony before Congress, put his \"own personal interests and emotions\" above FBI protocol and left a cloud of undue suspicion above the president's head. \"Over the last year, Mr. Comey has engaged in a pattern of calculated unilateral action unbounded by governing law, regulation and practice, and plainly motivated by personal and political self-interest,\" wrote Kasowitz, who has since stepped aside as lead lawyer. Lawyers for Comey declined to comment Saturday. Kasowitz and Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow did not immediately return messages, and former Trump attorney John Dowd declined to comment. The document does not focus on questions of Mr. Trump's guilt or innocence. Instead, it casts in a negative light actions that Comey has said he carefully reasoned and that he has vigorously defended in his book and interviews. Those include the decision to announce on his own without Justice Department consultation the conclusion of the Clinton investigation, and the decision months later to brief Mr. Trump \u2014 then the president-elect \u2014 on allegations about him in a salacious dossier. \"Mr. Comey continued his Machiavellian behavior after President Trump was elected,\" Kasowitz wrote. Among the principal lines of attack are Comey's acknowledgment that he provided his lawyers with contemporaneous memos about his interactions with Mr. Trump and authorized one of them to share details with the news media. In one such encounter, Comey said the president asked him at a private dinner for his loyalty and that Comey offered him \"honest loyalty\" instead. \"There is no 'honest loyalty' in an FBI Director surreptitiously leaking to civilians his privileged and confidential conversations with the president, or misappropriating and disseminating his confidential FBI memos or their contents about those meetings,\" Kasowitz wrote. \"There is no 'honest loyalty' in using those civilians as surrogates to feed stolen information and memos to the press to achieve a personal, political, and retributive objective of harming a sitting president.\" Like Mr. Trump, the lawyer also complains about Comey's refusal to state publicly to Congress that the president was not under investigation even though he said so privately. \"Despite his repeated assurances to the President over the prior three months that he was not under investigation, the President's repeated pleas to make that fact public, and Mr. Comey's testimony that he had DOJ (Department of Justice) approval to make this 'extraordinary' announcement, Mr. Comey not only declined to clarify that there was no investigation of the President, but he used broad language that only reinforced the inaccurate perception that the President was under investigation,\" Kasowitz wrote. The New York Times earlier reported that Kasowitz had written two letters to Mueller in June 2017 and published one in which he categorically rejected the idea that Comey's firing could constitute obstruction of justice. The AP obtained a copy of the other document, in addition to a two-page memo from September in which Trump lawyers lament to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller was \"inexplicably\" not investigating Comey's \"misconduct\" they had earlier raised. Kasowitz says Comey stonewalled the president's request to clear his name in order to \"sustain an investigative cloud\" over his head that would make it hard for Mr. Trump to fire him. Comey, for his part, has said he had already told congressional leaders who was and was not under investigation, and that he was reluctant to make public statements in case something changed and he needed to correct the record. The letter castigates Comey for usurping the authority of his Justice Department bosses by announcing the conclusion of the Clinton investigation without seeking their approval, a criticism echoed by the inspector general last month. Comey has said he made the announcement alone because of concern that Justice Department leadership was seen as politically compromised. The letter says Comey \"confronted\" the president-elect in a January 2017 Trump Tower meeting \"with phony but highly embarrassing allegations concerning his personal life\" from a dossier compiled by a former British spy. It was the first in a series of conversations that Comey documented in writing, something Trump lawyers say he did with the ultimate goal of harming the president. Comey has said he told Mr. Trump about the dossier allegations because they were widely known in Washington, including by the media, and that he kept his memos because he was concerned that Trump might lie about their conversations. In the September memo obtained by AP, Dowd, who left the legal team in March, expressed dismay to Rosenstein that there's no grand jury investigation into \"the obviously corrupt conclusion\" of the Clinton investigation, suggesting it was improper that Comey had begun drafting a statement closing the probe even before Clinton was interviewed. \"Today, you are faced with a terrible blight on our Department of Justice which must be addressed to restore and inspire confidence in the Department,\" Dowd said in calling for the grand jury investigation.",

            "article_content": "The nonprofit named for the late Sen. John McCain is looking for \"mavericks\" to vote in the Nov. 6 midterm election and fight for human rights around the world. The plea comes as President Trump pursues his \"America first\" foreign policy. \"The ideals that John spent his life fighting for weren't just his, they are American values \u2014 and it's time to fight for them again,\" McCain's widow, Cindy, says in a video that's part of the \"Mavericks Needed\" nonpartisan campaign to be announced Tuesday. The rollout, previewed by The Associated Press, comes about two months after McCain's Aug. 25 death at 81 from brain cancer. The Arizona Republican was honored at a memorial service that was widely seen a bipartisan rebuke of Mr. Trump by official Washington. The service came after a cross-country funeral procession that McCain planned himself, including its themes of preserving freedom and serving a greater cause. Forming the backdrop was his life story: The scion of a Navy family, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and returned to serve in Congress for more than three decades. He never became president, but after two campaigns he returned to the Senate to burnish his brand as a party-bucking \"maverick.\" McCain at the end of his life made clear his disdain for Mr. Trump and his sense that the United States was losing its way on human rights. The issue is especially relevant amid the international outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. The controversy has raised questions not just for the Trump administration, which is closely aligned with the Saudis, but also for American institutions that have accepted the country's money. The McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, the entity launching the \"Mavericks Needed\" campaign, is among the recipients of Saudi cash. The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia donated $1 million to The McCain Institute Foundation in 2014, the largest single gift listed on its tax filings since its creation in 2012. The nonprofit also gets large donations from other sources. It was established with about $8.7 million from the McCain-Palin Compliance Fund, a political account used to pay for legal and other fees related to McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Kurt Volker, executive director of the McCain Institute, said Monday that the Saudi gift was a one-time donation. He said the nonprofit would not accept any more Saudi funds. He and other McCain acolytes said the institute has, from its inception, advocated for human rights as part of its broader agenda. In March, they presented the idea that became \"Mavericks Needed\" to McCain. Volker said younger Americans, age 18 to 35, don't think about the term \"human rights\" \u2014 and when they do, they think of social justice issues like racial and gender-based discrimination. \"They tend not to think in terms of fundamental freedoms, such as freedom from arbitrary arrest,\" he said. Mark Salter, McCain's biographer, said the campaign is aimed at building a constituency. Both he and Volker said the effort is not about Mr. Trump. \"We've lost an important voice in human rights,\" Salter said of McCain. \"We're trying to encourage other people who have a collective voice that was as potent and influential as his was. Even more so.\" Developed in detail after McCain's death, the \"Mavericks Needed\" campaign features a centerpiece ad that includes McCain's voice from his speech to the Munich Security Conference in 2017. It will run on digital and social media platforms across five U.S. markets: Austin, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; and Phoenix, in McCain's home state. \"We stand for truth against falsehood, freedom against tyranny, right against injustice, hope against despair,\" McCain's voice can be heard saying in the ad. \"I believe we must always stand up for it. For if we do not, who will?\" In the version running between now and the midterm election, the one-minute spot closes with text on black background: \"Vote on November 6.\" A building-sized banner is expected to be unfurled Tuesday on ASU's Fulton Center in Tempe, Arizona. A second version of \"A Call For Mavericks\" will run through March. The whole campaign is expected to run through 2020.",

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh emailed his White House colleagues in June 2003 with an alert: The U.S. Supreme Court was about to release opinions on the University of Michigan's use of race as a factor to admit students. It was an issue of great interest to his boss, President George W. Bush \u2014 who favored race-neutral admissions \u2014 and one Kavanaugh had followed for years. Staff prepared a response anticipating the practice would be struck down, saying, \"We must be ever mindful not to use means that create another wrong and thus perpetuate our divisions\" in the pursuit of diversity. But the next day, justices released a 5-4 opinion written by Reagan appointee Sandra Day O'Connor that upheld the university's law school admissions policy, a disappointment that prompted then-Bush policy adviser Joel Kaplan to email Kavanaugh, then a White House attorney: \"What's going on???\" In a separate 6-3 opinion, the court said race could be a factor in undergraduate admissions, but not the deciding factor. There is no evidence of a reply from Kavanaugh among the tens of thousands of pages of emails released by the Senate Judiciary Committee from his time in the White House counsel's office. But as President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, his views on affirmative action, along with voting rights and discrimination, are coming under intense scrutiny by civil rights organizations as the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares to begin confirmation hearings Tuesday. \"We are confident that if he's confirmed to the court, he would undermine the court's integrity and would prove a grave threat to civil rights, racial justice and the marginalized communities that the Legal Defense Fund represents,\" Janai Nelson, associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said Thursday as the organization officially opposed Kavanaugh's nomination and asked the Senate to place its consideration on hold until more documents from his career were made available. Civil rights organizations that have been combing through Kavanaugh's 300-plus decisions during 12 years as a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C., his work as a lawyer and his time inside Bush's White House say there are red flags. He co-wrote a brief as a private attorney in a case involving native Hawaiians that they fear signals his personal opposition to affirmative action, and he wrote the appellate court opinion upholding South Carolina's voter ID law. Kavanaugh's record also includes opinions that civil rights advocates would praise in other candidates \u2014 including that a single utterance of a racial epithet toward a black employee could create a hostile work environment under federal law, and a suggestion that federal courts should make it clear that discriminatory actions by employers violate the Civil Rights Act. That contrasting record underscores the challenge facing groups that already opposed Kavanaugh because he was on a list of potential nominees put forward by the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, essentially certifying them as appropriately conservative for Mr. Trump, who has vowed to move the high court to the right while replacing retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. The White House had no comment for this story but referred The Associated Press to a former Kavanaugh law clerk, an African-American, who said Kavanaugh is attuned to civil rights and racial justice issues. \"In my experience with him, he's someone who approaches cases fairly and with an open mind,\" said Luke McCloud, who clerked for Kavanaugh from 2013 to 2014 and is now in private practice. He praised Kavanaugh's efforts to recruit and mentor minority lawyers, adding that Kavanaugh \"acknowledges the history and current reality of race in this country and takes it into account as he can within the confines of his role as a judge.\" Kavanaugh's keen interest in affirmative action is evident in the released White House emails. Although he appeared careful to withhold his own opinion, he clearly was interested in Bush's anti-affirmative action views, often emailing and receiving articles and opinion pieces on the issue. Also, while in private practice a few years earlier, Kavanaugh wrote a brief along with failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork challenging a law banning non-native Hawaiians from voting in Office of Hawaiian Affairs elections. He also wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal sharply criticizing the policy, but during confirmation hearings for the appeals court post, he said he wrote the piece to advance his client's position and refused to say whether he agreed. The case involved a $300 million public trust fund set up by Congress to compensate ancestors of native Hawaiians whose land and cultural heritage were taken by the U.S. The state said only blood relatives could vote in board of trustees elections, while Kavanaugh challenged that as discriminatory to non-indigenous residents. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that the law amounted to racial discrimination. Kavanaugh's brief and other comments around the case indicate that he thinks government will ultimately end up race-blind, which \"could signal where his own thinking is\" on affirmative action, said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who also opposes Kavanaugh. \"His record is deeply disturbing ... but there is a lot we don't know.\" Opponents point to other issues that trouble them, especially his 2012 ruling on South Carolina's voter ID law. Kavanaugh said the statute was legal because those who had difficulty getting a photo ID still could vote by signing an affidavit. The law had been blocked by the Justice Department, which sided with those who said such laws make it more difficult for minorities to vote and are pushed by conservatives to dampen minority turnout. Critics also question his record on employment discrimination, citing an appellate court case in which Kavanaugh disagreed with the majority of judges, who said that a black woman fired from a job as House of Representatives deputy budget director could pursue claims of racial discrimination and retaliation in federal court. \"We're mostly concerned about whether Judge Kavanaugh, if confirmed, would approach civil rights issues with the appropriate understanding and respect for the history of racial discrimination in this country,\" said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.",

            "article_content": "Among the many issuers of municipal bonds in the U.S. are institutions of higher education. And while all these schools pay underwriting fees to issue their securities in the capital market, some pay notably more. New academic research found that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in particular pay much higher fees than their peers to issue their bonds. The economists argue in their report that this is the result of racism. Scheduled to be published in an upcoming edition of The Journal of Financial Economics, the economists found that borrowing costs for HBCUs were about 20 percent higher than non-HBCUs, placing HBCUs at a financial disadvantage in raising money to fund their operations. For example, an HBCU borrowing $30 million pays about $299,000 in fees, roughly $57,000 higher than other colleges and universities. These costs add up quickly. Other factors including state tax breaks and the credit ratings of individual school issues were considered in the paper, which examined 4,145 tax-exempt bond issues from 1988 to 2010. These securities were worth $150 billion, and were issued by 965 colleges and universities, including 102 HBCUs.\u00a0 However, the paper concluded that racial discrimination was the primary reason for the higher costs borne by HBCUs, half of which are public and supported by taxpayers. Those steeper fees appear \"to reflect higher costs of finding willing buyers,\" the researchers said. Furthermore, HBCUs in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi -- which rank highest in racial resentment and opposition to affirmative action as measured by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study survey -- pay underwriters municipal bond fees three times that of HBCUs in other states. \u00a0 The authors of the paper, Paul Gao of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, Casey Dougal of Drexel University, William J. Mayew of Duke University and Christopher A. Parsons of the University of Washington, propose several solutions to the fee disparities. Among the fixes they envision are boosting incentives to investors, such as making the HBCUs' bonds exempt from all income taxes. Muni bondholders typically don't pay any federal taxes and are usually exempt from state taxes if they buy from entities in states where they live. The paper's findings ring true for Alvin J. Schexnider, management consultant and a former chancellor at Winston-Salem State University, an HBCU. \"There are instances where HBCUs present profiles similar to [predominantly white institutions], yet must pay more to borrow,\" he wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"What can be done? Discrimination must also be called out.\" Unfortunately for many HBCUs, such as Pennsylvania's Cheney University, they face serious financial challenges. Cheney, the oldest HBCU, averted\u00a0a potential shutdown\u00a0last year when the Middle States Commission on Higher Education extended the .the probationary period for its accreditation to give it more time to get its financial affairs in order. The institutions, many of which were founded during the Reconstruction Era when African Americans had no other higher education options, have seen their enrollments dwindle over the decades as other colleges diversified their student bodies. As a result, experts predict that a quarter of them may close their doors within the next two decades, which may result in the merger of some institutions. \"We will be sending a formal letter to U.S. Secretary of Education DeVos to request that she look into these findings and work with us to find solutions for HBCU sustainability and higher education equality,\" writes wrote Harry L. Williams, CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The findings that this study makes also helps to reemphasize the importance of the HBCU Capital Finance Program, which is a lower-cost alternative to existing bond markets, and about the work that the Department of Education needs to undertake to further educate and engage more HBCUs in the Cap Finance program.\"\u00a0 Jonathan Berr is an award-winning journalist and podcaster based in New Jersey whose main focus is on business and economic issues.",

            "article_content": "In January 2018, former Democratic Senator Al Franken resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. On Tuesday, Minnesotans will choose who will compete in a fall special election to complete the remainder of Franken's Senate term through 2020. Depending on Tuesday's results, this could shape up to be a race between two female candidates -- incumbent Democratic Senator Tina Smith, who Gov. Mark Dayton appointed to fill Franken's seat after he resigned, and Republican State Senator Karin Housley. A CBS News analysis finds that out of the approximately 400 U.S. House, Senate, and gubernatorial primaries so far this cycle, 161 female Democratic candidates have advanced to the general election, compared to 50 Republican women candidates. In Minnesota's very competitive 2nd District in the suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, incumbent Republican Rep. Jason Lewis is facing a slew of controversy over comments he made on a radio show he hosted prior to serving in Congress, including\u00a0complaining that women could no longer be called \"sluts\" and\u00a0equating gay marriage to rape. Lewis also wrote a\u00a0book\u00a0in which he calls for any state to be able to \"peaceably leave the union,\" and equated slavery with taxing rich people. Lewis won the district in 2016 with 47 percent, beating Democrat Angie Craig by less than two percent. They will face off again in the fall. Some, but not all, of his controversial comments were public during the last race and Democrats attempted to use them against him at the time. The group to watch this election is educated suburban women -- will they turn out to vote and how their votes swing this fall? And the place to keep a close eye on is Minneapolis, where #MeToo looms over the political landscape.\u00a0 Two-term Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty launched an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2012 cycle, running as a self-professed commonsense \"Sam's Club Republican.\" He later endorsed Gov. Mitt Romney, was on the top of his vice presidential shortlist, and was a frequent surrogate on the campaign trail. Although Pawlenty was in the private sector during the 2016 cycle, he was a vocal critic of then-candidate Trump.\u00a0 Following the release of the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, Pawlenty\u00a0rescinded his endorsement\u00a0and called Donald Trump \"unsound, uninformed, unhinged and unfit to be president of the United States.\"\u00a0 Yet after launching his campaign to win a third term as Minnesota's governor earlier this year, Pawlenty said he did indeed vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And despite his past criticism of Mr. Trump, now Pawlenty and his primary challenger, former member of the Minnesota House Jeff Johnson, are trying to out-Trump each other. Both Pawlenty and Johnson said they would welcome an\u00a0endorsement from Mr. Trump\u00a0and the race has been described as a test of\u00a0who can be more conservative\u00a0and embrace Trump's policies the most. Meanwhile in Wisconsin, former 2016 presidential candidate and Trump opponent Republican Gov. Scott Walker is seeking reelection to a third term in a state that Trump won by 1 point in 2016. Walker, like many others in the GOP, is walking the fine line between embracing the president and his policies and trying to hold onto more moderate voters.\u00a0 Walker asked Mr. Trump to revisit his steel and aluminum tariffs that would adversely affect Wisconsin companies like Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson, which announced in June it would outsource some production overseas to avert those tariffs.\u00a0 In addition, the\u00a0Trump administration recently approved\u00a0Walker's plan to lower Obamacare premiums in Wisconsin, even though the president has yet to endorse Walker's gubernatorial bid. A recent NBC News/Marist College\u00a0poll\u00a0from July shows Wisconsin schools Superintendent Tony Evers, the Democratic frontrunner, leading Walker by 13 points in a head-to-head match-up. But Walker is the only governor to survive a recall election, and he also enjoys the support of the Koch brothers, who recently expressed dismay with Mr.\u00a0 Trump. This race is sure to be competitive as Walker tries to appeal to two different bases - Trump supporters and moderates. In Wisconsin, incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin is running for re-election. She will run in the general election against state Senator Leah Vukmir or veteran and first-time candidate Kevin Nicholson. Baldwin is one of 10 Democratic U.S. senators trying to defend their seats in states that Trump won in 2016. Hillary Clinton expected to win the state, but according to the\u00a0New York Times' count, \"Mr. Trump won the state by just 27,000 voters.\" The Times went on to point out that turnout in the lowest-income neighborhoods had dropped dramatically -- 19.5 percent from 2012. A Sunday\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 82 percent of blacks disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of race relations and racial issues, and 73 percent of Hispanics disapprove. \u00a0As Democrats strive for a Blue Wave, they are vying not only to bring Obama-Trump voters back to the fold but also to mobilize non-white voters who stayed home in 2016. Turnout in Milwaukee this fall could be a good indicator of their progress. If Democratic gubernatorial first-time candidate Christine Hallquist wins the Vermont primary on Tuesday, she will be one\u00a0step closer\u00a0towards becoming the nation's first transgender governor. As the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0points out, \"The country is seeing an increase in potentially historic candidacies across many demographics, including the LGBTQ community.\"\u00a0 In Hawaii's primary election this past Saturday night, Kim Coco Iwamoto, another transgender candidate, lost the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Hawaii. But Alexandra Chandler, Massachusetts' first openly transgender candidate for Congress, is vying for the Democratic nomination in the crowded primary election for Massachusetts' third district on September 4. According to the\u00a0Boston Globe, \"Chandler says she intends to put another voice to the ballot measure that asks voters whether to keep the state's anti-discrimination law on transgender rights on the books.\" Vermont's gubernatorial primary also features 14-year-old candidate Ethan Sonneborn. Vermont has no age requirement for gubernatorial candidates. Although he is taking the campaign seriously and hopes to win,\u00a0Sonneborn told the Washington Post\u00a0that he hopes his campaign inspires his peers: \"It's on us to build our own future,\" he said. \"You've got to get involved, you've got to vote, you've got to knock on doors. It's how we're going to make the changes we want to see in the state, in this country, in this world. When we get involved, we make our democracy stronger.\" On Saturday, Rep. Chris Collins, indicted for insider trading, announced that he would suspend his re-election campaign in his reliably Republican 27th District in western New York. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u00a0issued this statement\u00a0Saturday calling Collins' announcement \"insufficient:\" \"Speaker Ryan must call on Congressman Collins to resign. \u00a0No person is above the law, not the President nor his first supporter in Congress. This insufficient and overdue announcement does little to drain the toxic cesspool of self-enrichment, special interest deals and corruption that has proliferated in Washington under GOP control.\" National Republicans are worried that if his name stays on the ballot they could lose this heretofore safe Republican seat, so they are looking into options to get his name off the ballot. But the process to get off the ballot in New York this late is burdensome, and the Republican party will have to appoint or elect him to another office in the state. They are trying to move him to a town clerkship race, and that would allow GOP county officials to handpick a new candidate for the race since the federal primary passed. There are four primaries on Tuesday, August 14: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held districts to take control of the House of Representatives this fall, and CBS News rates 4 of the House districts facing primary elections on Tuesday as \"very likely\" or \"probably\" competitive in November (MN-1, MN-2, MN-3, and MN-8). On Tuesday, Minnesota has two Senate primary elections, and Connecticut, Vermont, and Wisconsin each have one Senate primary election. In Minnesota, both Senate seats are currently held by Democrats, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Tina Smith. Klobuchar is expected to win re-election. Jim Newberger has emerged as the top Republican contender to challenge Klobuchar this fall. Smith was appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton to fill Al Franken's seat after he resigned. She is running in a special election in November to fill the remainder of Franken's term, which was set to end in 2020. Five Democrats are challenging Smith in the primary: Ali Chehem Ali, Gregg Iverson, Nick Leonard, Richard Painter, and Christopher Seymore. On the Republican side, State Senator Karin Housley is the frontrunner in the primary and won the party's endorsement to compete in the special election to fill Franken's vacated seat. In Wisconsin, incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin is running for re-election. She will run in the general election against state Senator Leah Vukmir or veteran and first time candidate Kevin Nicholson. Baldwin is one of 10 Democratic U.S. Senators trying to defend their seats in states that Trump won in 2016.\u00a0In Connecticut and Vermont, incumbent Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and incumbent Independent Senator Bernie Sanders are expected to easily win re-election in the fall. There are gubernatorial primaries in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin on Tuesday. In Connecticut, Democratic incumbent Governor Dannel Malloy is not seeking re-election. The Democratic primary race is between Ned Lamont and Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim. Ganim served a seven-year prison sentence for corruption charges but voters still elected him\u00a0mayor. Ganim also ran for governor in 1994, but he dropped out of the race. Similar to Ganim, Lamont ran for governor in 2010, but lost to Malloy. He also defeated Sen. Joe Lieberman in the primary, but lost to Lieberman in the general election when Lieberman ran as an independent. Lamont was also a businessman as he started his own company in the telecommunications industry. Lamont said that if Ganim won the\u00a0primary, he would not support him. Ganim portrayed Lamont as an established millionaire candidate. The Republican primary race includes Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, Tim Herbst, veteran Steve Obsitnik, former DFC Global executive Bob Stefanowski, and hedge fund founder David Stemerman. Boughton ran for governor in 2010 and 2014, but lost each time. The two favorites in the\u00a0race\u00a0are Lamont and Boughton as they each won their party's nomination. In Minnesota, State Representative Erin Murphy, Rep. Tim Walz, and state Attorney General Lori Swanson are vying for the Democratic nomination. Murphy has been endorsed by the Minnesota DFL, EMILY's List, National Nurses United, Our Revolution Minnesota, and the Sierra Club, among others.\u00a0 Walz, who currently represents Minnesota's first district, is vacating his seat to run for governor. He defeated his Republican challenger by less than 1 percent in 2016. He was first elected in 2006, when he defeated a six term Republican incumbent to win the seat. Mr. Trump won his district in 2016 with 53.3 percent to Clinton's 38.4 percent, but in 2012 and 2008 the district went to Obama, who won with 49.6 percent to Romney's 48.2 percent, and 50.8 percent to McCain's 46.7 percent.\u00a0 On the Republican side, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and Jeff Johnson are competing to progress to the general election. Johnson is a former member of the Minnesota House and Hennepin County Commissioner. He has previously run for governor and attorney general. In Vermont, Republican incumbent Phil Scott is running for re-election. Scott's competitor is Keith Stern, a Springfield\u00a0businessman. There are\u00a0four\u00a0Democratic candidates running in the primary. They include: James Ehlers, Christine Hallquist, Brenda Siegel and Ethan Sonneborn. Ehlers, the executive director of Lake Champlain International, was a former advisor to Sen. Sanders. If Hallquist, a former executive at a utility company, wins the primary, she will be a\u00a0step closer\u00a0towards becoming the nation's first transgender governor. Siegel is the Executive Director of the Southern Vermont Dance Festival and has been involved in her local Democratic committees. The Washington Post wrote a\u00a0profile\u00a0about 14-year-old candidate Sonneborn. In Wisconsin, incumbent Governor Scott Walker is running for a third term. He is the only governor to survive a recall election. The Democratic field is crowded with eight contenders vying for the Democratic nomination. In a recent debate in mid-July, eight Democratic candidates mostly agreed on policy issues and all but one\u00a0vowed to support\u00a0the Democratic nominee. The eight Democratic candidates who participated in the debate were: activist Mike McCabe, attorney Matt Flynn, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers, former state Rep. Kelda Roys, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, fire fighter Mahlon Mitchell, State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout and attorney Josh Pade.\u00a0 Based on the polling, Evers seems to be the favorite among the Democratic candidates. He has been touting his ability to\u00a0win a statewide election, which he has done three times. Mitchell, Vinehout and Roys could make\u00a0history\u00a0if elected governor. Mitchell would be the first black governor of Wisconsin, while either Vinehout or Roys would be the first female governor of Wisconsin. Roys received national attention for a\u00a0campaign video\u00a0that showed her breastfeeding and she has also received\u00a0support\u00a0from EMILY's List. Correction: A previous version of this story said that 162 female Democratic candidates have advanced to the general election, compared to 43 Republican women candidates. The correct numbers are 161 female Democratic candidates and 50 Republican women candidates.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "In this excerpt from his new book, \"Faith: A Journey for All,\" published by Simon & Schuster (A division of CBS), former President and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jimmy Carter writes about the importance of faith to help man meet today's challenges and evolve a future of peaceful coexistence.\u00a0 Don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with President Carter on \"Sunday Morning\" March 25! INTRODUCTION Living faith always involves love. \u2014Richard Niebuhr  Faith without works is not faith at all, but a simple lack of obedience to God. \u2014Dietrich Bonhoeffer The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. \u2014Galatians 5:6 The issue of faith arises in almost every area of human existence, so it is important to understand its multiple meanings. For many of us, a question that needs to be answered is \"Am I a person of faith?\" The answer is almost always affirmative. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. I also emphasize the religious aspects of faith since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my own faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God. Faith, in both its religious and broader dimensions, influences our individual and communal lives, our lives in religion, and our lives in government and in secular affairs.  The most important element of faith ever imposed on me, and on another person simultaneously, involved the threat of the total elimination of human life on earth by a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. My ultimate responsibility as President of the United States was to defend my country against a military attack, and I learned soon after my election that we and the Soviets had enough atomic weapons in our arsenals to destroy each other and that the resulting radiation and other collateral damage would kill most of the rest of the world's population. This was a constant haunting realization that dominated my conscious hours during my term in office \u2014 and I shared the responsibility with Leonid Brezhnev, President of the Soviet Union. Our common goal, of course, was to avoid a nuclear war. Brezhnev and I had to have faith in ourselves, and in each other. Every decision I made was affected by this threat, and it still exists, as the same responsibility is passed on from one president to the next.  We face many issues within which religion, politics, and private matters tend to mix, sometimes explosively, creating sharp divisions among us, in our private and public lives and between and within religious denominations. It is increasingly difficult to keep issues of religion and government separate, as even the purely religious issues are routinely addressed by politicians \u2014 and vice versa. I have confronted the separation of government and religion from both directions. I think often of the strong reaction of our visiting revival preacher in my mother's home when I decided to run for the state senate back in 1962. He asked me, \"How can you, as a Christian, a deacon, and a Sunday School teacher, become involved in the dirty business of politics?\" Without thinking, I gave him a smart-aleck response: \"I will have 75,000 people in my senate district. How would you like to have a congregation that big?\"  I believe now, more than then, that Christians are called to plunge into the life of the world, and to inject the moral and ethical values of our faith into the processes of governing. At the same time, there must be an absolute prohibition against granting any control by government over our religious freedoms. More recently, since our years in the White House, I have tended to move away from politics and toward religion, but the two are still related. There is no doubt that my having been a national political leader is what attracts most visitors to my Bible classes, and it is clear to me that many of these worshippers are eager to help shape our nation's political agenda.  In a speech to my fellow Baptists in 1978, I tried to explain the duality of my personal responsibilities as a president and a Christian:  Thomas Jefferson, in the original days of our country, said he was fearful that the church might influence the state to take away human liberty. Roger Williams, who created the first Baptist church in America, was afraid that the church might be corrupted by the state. These concerns led to our Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the establishment of any official state religion and, in the same sentence, prohibits the passing of any laws that might interfere with religious freedom.  Separation is specified in the law, but for a religious person, there is nothing wrong with bringing these two together, because you can't divorce religious beliefs from public service. At the same time, of course, in public office you cannot impose your own religious beliefs on others.  In my office at the White House I have to deal with many domestic and international problems: peace, freedom, nuclear explosives, the sale of weapons, terrorism, rapidly expanding populations without adequate food. But this is more than a list of political problems. These are also moral problems for you and me, because they violate the very precepts of God in which we believe.  I want our country to be strong enough in all elements, military and otherwise, so we never have to prove we are strong.  Reinhold Niebuhr, in his book Moral Man and Immoral Society, pointed out the difference between a society and a people. The expectations from a person are a much higher standard. A person should have as our goal complete agape (self-sacrificial love). The most we can expect from a society is to institute simple justice. So, we as people have to do better, particularly if we are blessed with the opportunity to demonstrate our worth. Leaders also must be careful not to be too timid. ...  A country will have authority and influence because of moral factors, not its military strength; because it can be humble and not blatant and arrogant; because our people and our country want to serve others and not dominate others. And a nation without morality will soon lose its influence around the world.  What are the goals of a person or a denomination or a country? They are all remarkably the same: a desire for peace; a need for humility, for examining one's faults and turning away from them; a commitment to human rights in the broadest sense of the words, based on a moral society concerned with the alleviation of suffering because of deprivation or hatred or hunger or physical affliction; and a willingness, even an eagerness, to share one's ideals, one's faith with others, to translate love in a person to justice.  I was brought up in a family that was stable, cohesive, and remarkably isolated from the outside world, except for the small community of Plains, Georgia. Home was our unchangeable haven, in times of pain or pleasure. There was no doubt that my father made the final decisions, but we all knew that Mama's influence and opinions were always major factors in the management of our family. There were certain aspects of life, particularly in the running of the household and the raising of my sisters, that were almost exclusively my mother's purview. Together, our parents were dominant, and we children respected and obeyed them. In fact, I never deliberately disobeyed either of them. It was my mother, then my father, in whom I had absolute faith.  Nowadays, most Americans move around frequently and are exposed to many influences, and our environments and customs are multifaceted. But for me as a child, there were just a few sources of knowledge about myself or any other people. Our contacts with the world beyond our community were limited. We didn't have running water or electricity in our house, so time on the battery radio was restricted, even on the rare evenings when we stayed up after dark. On special nights, keeping our eyes fixed on the radio, we listened as a family to The Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie, Fibber McGee and Molly, and Amos 'n' Andy. My parents would sometimes let me stay up until 8:00 p.m. to hear Glenn Miller's band playing the current musical hits for fifteen minutes. That was all the outside world I knew. In addition to my family and our close neighbors, all African-American, I encountered other people just through school and the church in Plains. Our prom parties, which parents would support for entertainment and primarily to let boys and girls get acquainted in preparation for future marriages, were orchestrated by the church.  Sunday mornings were for Sunday School and preaching at Plains Baptist Church, where Daddy was a teacher and a deacon. I remember vividly that after church we always had the best meal of the week, usually fried chicken, mashed potatoes, hot biscuits, and vegetables from our big garden, followed by pies made from sweet potatoes or fruits of the season. Afterward, our activities were severely limited. There were no stores open, movies in the county seat were out of the question, and shooting a gun or playing cards was prohibited. Fishing in the nearby creek or pond was a close call, but eventually it came to be permitted if done discreetly. It would not have been appropriate, however, to walk down a public road with a fishing pole. My mother and father played cards, mostly bridge, but certainly not on Sunday. At the age of twelve, when I was deemed old enough to drive a car by myself, my sisters and I went back to the church on Sunday evenings for meetings of the Baptist Young People's Union (BYPU). This was very important, because it was the BYPU that sponsored most of the teenage social events. I need not go on, since the picture is fairly clear. It was a simple, family-centered, deeply religious, working existence, with interracial labor and play on the farm with my black neighbors. All the farmwork was done by humans or mules, and we grew corn as the common fuel for both. I imagine that, except for the radio, automobile, and a hand-cranked telephone, our lives were quite similar to those of our great- grandparents.  During those early years, I witnessed the racial discrimination that still survived almost a hundred years after the end of the Civil War. Mandatory segregation of black and white citizens was supported and enforced, at least in the Southeastern United States, by state and federal laws, and was not questioned by anyone of influence that I knew. The only person who paid no attention to these racial customs was my mother, and she treated everyone the same because, I presumed, she was a registered nurse and a member of the medical profession. When I was a child, all my friends and playmates were African- American, and the one who was preeminent at any time was whoever had caught the biggest fish, killed the most rabbits, or could run faster, jump higher, or pick the most cotton in a day. When I rode to our county seat with one of my playmates, we always sat in different railroad cars and at separate levels in the movie theater, attended different schools and churches, and I knew that white students rode in buses and black students walked to and from school. I do not remember knowing that only white adults were permitted to vote and to serve on juries.  My first awareness of how segregation affected me and my friends was when my playmates and I were about twelve years old, when we were leaving the field and approaching the barn through what we called the \"pasture gate.\" The two black boys stood back to let me pass, and I presumed there was a trip wire there or some other reason for them to want me to go through first. Only much later did I realize that their parents had probably told them it was time for them to defer to me in some way. In a poem I wrote as an adult, I said,  We only saw it vaguely then,  but we were transformed at that place.  A silent line was drawn between  friend and friend, race and race.  The next event that affected me directly was when I was a submarine officer and President Harry Truman ordained as commander in chief that all our military forces and the U.S. Civil Service end racial segregation. There was no trouble in implementing this command, and all of us on the ship saw the advantages gained by both black and white members of the crew. When our family returned home from the navy in 1953, this commitment to racial equality had become a part of our lives.  My father taught me that there should be a strict divide between religion and politics, and he also resented very deeply any intrusion of state or federal laws into our private affairs. I remember that Daddy opposed changing our clocks from \"God's sun time\" to \"daylight saving time,\" and although a staunch Democrat in other elections, he never voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt after 1932, because the New Deal agricultural program provided, to stabilize farm prices, that half-grown pigs (shoats) should be slaughtered and that part of our growing crops of cotton and peanuts had to be plowed up. For many years afterward, Daddy recalled how difficult it was to force a trained mule to walk on top of a planted row to plow it up instead of in the middle to cultivate. I guess that today he would be known as a libertarian.  When I look back on my life, I can see how startling the changes have been. Eric Hoffer (1902-1983), the self-educated longshoreman and philosopher, described the years during my childhood as a time of hope, and the time of my adulthood as a time of desire. I knew the Great Depression years to be a time of hope, when the economic situation in America was so bad that everyone believed it could only improve; when things became plentiful, we tended to want not only what we already had but also what everyone else had.  Both at my presidential inauguration and when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, I quoted my favorite teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, who summarized her advice on how to accommodate the uncertainties in our future: \"We must welcome changing times, but cling to principles that never change.\" I would say that \"cling to\" meant \"have faith in.\" I have thought often about Miss Julia's advice over the years, and especially during some of the most trying times of my life, when I had to decide which enduring principles should be applied to a particular event or situation, and sometimes I use it in my church and college classes and in counseling people who are distressed about current crises that we have to face.  Today, of course, family life even in the small Plains community is quite different. Some activities that were once strictly concealed in our \"proper\" society are probably no more prevalent but are now out in the open. Divorce has become acceptable, even for active church members. Without trying to analyze it too deeply, I see that one of the most significant changes is the relationship between young people and their parents. My siblings and I had an intimate and subservient relationship with our parents until we left home, but now the ties are substantially broken during the early teen years, no matter how much parents want to retain a strong influence over their growing children. The outside world is a much more powerful factor in life, with the availability of rapid transportation, television, social media, and particularly a broader circle of friends (and possibly rivals or adversaries), whose influence often exceeds that of immediate families. But perhaps just as many in today's world would still like to have certain faith in a core of principles that do not change. Where do we turn now when there is a moral question to be answered? What things in the twenty-first century are the same as they were eighty years ago? We still need a permanent foundation on which our lives can be fashioned. Without a central core of beliefs or standards in which to have faith and by which to live, we may never experience the challenge and excitement of seeking a greater life. We will have ceased to grow, like Jesus, \"strong; he was, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him\" (Luke 2:40).  We must accommodate life's challenges, some welcome and others quite painful, but we don't want the verities of our lives to change. We need to have something unshakable in which to have faith, like a mother's love \u2014 something that can't be changed or destroyed by war, political events, the loss of a loved one, lack of success in business, a serious illness, or failure to realize our own ambitions. We need some foundation on which we can build a predictable and dependable existence.  This cannot always be found in either our nation's laws or our social customs. I would like to say as an American who has been president that the cherished values of our country are constant, but they are not. There are always powerful forces that work against the idealistic principles of peace, truthfulness, equality, justice, and even hospitality, freedom, and friendship. There is a lot of secret maneuvering that is never understood or even known by the public, and a great deal of unpublicized change in the interpretation of laws or the passage of new ones. Some laws violate what seem to be accepted principles and create serious divisions within our society. Also, almost every major religious faith \u2014 Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Islamic \u2014 is divided over controversial secular issues like abortion, gay rights, the role of women in society, or even female clothing. But despite the confusion and controversy in secular affairs and among religious organizations, the basic principles I've just mentioned have never changed. These are the foundation for our faith.  People have always tried to improve their own lives, through communal living and the evolution of secular laws and rules considered to be beneficial, at least to a dominant portion of them. So far as I know, a concerted worldwide effort to encapsulate high ideals into a common agreement has been made only once, and included the nations who had been victorious, or at least neutral, in World War II. This common agreement is known as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I remember that I followed the United Nations proceedings in San Francisco very closely as a member of the U.S. Navy, either as a midshipman at Annapolis or from a battleship in the Atlantic Ocean. The key nations that founded the U.N. in October 1945 were the \"Big Four\" \u2014 China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States \u2014 and they were joined by forty-seven others. The overriding objective was to prevent further armed conflicts after more than 60 million people had been killed in the war, and to agree on a set of peace incentives that could prevent warfare among future potential disputants. For many complex reasons, the United Nations's primary goal of preserving peace has not been reached.  Since that time, the military forces of our own country have been involved in conflict with more than twenty other nations, in wars that cost the lives of 10 million people, and the potential for further military engagements remains. As of November 2017, the United States military forces were actively engaged in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Niger, Somalia, Jordan, and Thailand. Andrew Bacevich, a retired colonel who lost a son in Iraq, made an accurate comment: \"A collective indifference to war has become an emblem of contemporary America.\" One major reason for our citizens' lack of concern about warfare is that most families are not directly affected by these conflicts, since the burden of combat now falls on just the 1 percent of Americans who serve in the military.  To live in peace is only one of the key human rights, and in December 1948, when the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it described these principles in thirty brief articles. To the best of their ability, those who drafted this declaration extracted the highest moral and ethical ideals of the world's great religions and expressed them in secular terms that could be understood by lawmakers and private citizens of all nations. The Universal Declaration promised to all people the economic, social, political, cultural, and civic rights that underpin a life free from discrimination, want, and fear. As with the United Nations's promise of sustained peace, these promises of human rights have not been realized. It seems that there is a steady reduction in the number of things in which we can have faith.  We know that evolution is a global process, usually progressive, that results from the adaptation of living organisms to natural selection and sudden mutations. I believe it has been God's plan to evolve human beings, and that after thousands of centuries we now find ourselves uniquely endowed with an understanding of who and what we are and have the knowledge and freedom to help shape our own destiny. This freedom to help in affecting our future evolution is a great challenge and opportunity, and it is our inherited duty to contribute to moral and spiritual advancement.  It is sobering to realize that the average human intelligence has probably not changed appreciably during the last ten thousand years. In fact, the total capacity of the brains of Neanderthals has been found to be greater than that of modern humans. We also know that the process of learning has greatly accelerated during recent times with our improved ability to share information rapidly. For the first time, we have become aware that our own existence is threatened by things such as nuclear weapons and global warming. These recognized threats are, perhaps, already an ongoing test of our human intelligence, our freedom, and our ability to shape our own destiny. The human challenge now is to survive by having sustained faith in each other and in the highest common moral principles that we have spasmodically evolved, and through mutual understanding and peaceful cooperation in addressing the discerned challenges to our common existence.  It is urgent that humans take a new look at the rapidly growing need for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Koran, or the teachings of Jesus Christ and to see if these visions of improved human interrelationships might be used to meet the challenges of the present moment and evolve a future of peaceful coexistence, based on faith in each other.

But Carter attempted to approach the matter less as a partisan who has endorsed Abrams and more as the former president who's spent the decades since he left the Oval Office monitoring elections around the world.\r\n \r\n\t\"One of the key requirements for a fair and trusted process is that there be a nonbiased supervision of the electoral process,\" Carter wrote, adding that stepping aside \"would be a sign that you recognize the importance of this key democratic principle and want to ensure the confidence of our citizens in the outcome.\"\r\n \r\n\tIt was not immediately clear whether Kemp has read the letter or responded. A spokeswoman in Kemp's office, where the letter was addressed, referred questions to Kemp's campaign, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\r\n \r\n\tAddressing calls for his resignation during a recent debate with Abrams, Kemp noted that bipartisan panels of local officials run much of the elections process. He also noted that one of his Democratic predecessors ran for governor without resigning, although Cathy Cox failed to win the Democratic nomination in 2006.\r\n \r\n\tDisclosure of Carter's letter comes with Kemp under scrutiny from multiple fronts, chief among them 53,000 voter registrations being held up by Kemp's office. Under the state's strict election laws, mail-in registrations must match exactly a voter's records on file with the Social Security Administration or Georgia's driver's license agency.\r\n \r\n\tRepublicans have returned fire, with Kemp alleging that Abrams and her backers want to give ballots to immigrants who are in the country illegally. That attack also is featured in a Republican ad being broadcast statewide.\r\n \r\n\tCarter sidestepped that back-and-forth in his letter, mentioning only \"the undeniable racial discrimination of the past\" and a federal court's recent criticism of the touchscreen voting machines used in some Georgia counties.\r\n \r\n\tU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in September cited \"a mounting tide of evidence of the inadequacy and security risks\" involved in Georgia's system. She agreed with voting integrity advocates who sued last year and argued that the touchscreen voting machines Georgia has used since 2002 are vulnerable to hacking and provide no way to confirm that votes have been recorded correctly because there's no paper trail.\r\n \r\n\tBut she sided with Kemp in denying the advocates' request to force the statewide use of paper ballots for the 2018 midterms. Kemp, who has been secretary of state since 2010, has recently joined calls to move to paper ballots but said it would have caused too much upheaval to make the change this year.\r\n \r\n\tKemp insists he's fairly applying Georgia law and that those would-be voters can cast ballots if they present acceptable identification \u2014 like any other Georgia voter \u2014 that clears up any questions. But Abrams and voting rights advocates have assailed the move \u2014 and sued \u2014 as part of a pattern Democrats say is intended to make it harder for minorities and other Democratic constituencies to vote.\r\n",

            "article_content": "Historian and best-selling author Jill Lepore found herself wishing there was a book that covered the history of the U.S. and reminded readers that the political polarization of today is really nothing new. So she wrote it. \u00a0 In her new book\u00a0\"These Truths,\"\u00a0Lepore takes on the task of tracking the nation's story starting with Christopher Columbus's voyage and continuing to the Civil War, the Civil Rights Era and President Trump's election in 2016. \"It's worth pulling back and trying to look across the centuries at the origins of these patterns and how people got out of similar jams in the past. So, that's one of the reasons I wanted to try to cover the whole sweep of American history, in all its contradictions and complexities,\" Lepore told \"CBS This Morning\" on Thursday. Partisanship and congressional in-fighting has been going on for centuries. As \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell pointed out, congressmen were fighting each other with canes in the 1800s. But, as Lepore explained, there is a reason today's polarization feels different.  \"I think what's different about our contemporary moment of polarization is that the polarization we're experiencing now was very particularly built by political consultants in the 1970s and 1980s really trying to get people out to vote over these emotional issues, guns and abortion,\" Lepore said. \"That was the work that was done by political consultants, for short-term, let's win this election next week.\" The practice of building momentum around emotional issues reached a new level with the advent of the internet. It meant that what political consultants once built by hand could now be automated.  \"Especially after the rise of social media, that polarization really is now done by automation. It's very difficult to figure it. I think so many people of great good will would like the country to be less polarized, would like to have conversations across partisan divisions \u2026 But it's very difficult to do because of the way the internet was opened up in a wholly unregulated way,\" she said.  Lepore also sought to write a history of the United States that integrated women's roles and contributions that are often excluded from books about political history. \u00a0 \"If you don't pay attention to women in the history of American politics, what you miss is a really crucial part of our political style which is the female crusade, the moral crusade. Because women were denied the vote for so long that the way that they acted politically was to crusade,\" she said. \"They brought that Evangelical fervor to the abolitionist movement and slavery, a moral crusade that women and men won. They brought it to the women's rights movement. In the 20th century, though they also brought it to Phyllis Schlafly's campaign against the ERA [which] was a moral crusade. It's actually, in the 20th century, been often conservative.\" Lepore's original intent was to end her book with the inauguration of Barack Obama. Then Donald Trump got elected.  \"It's really tough because the inauguration of Barack Obama \u2013 it's dramatic, it's a great ending. Whoever you voted for \u2026 something is solved about the American agony of racial bondage and discrimination, segregation there or seems to be solved at that moment ... But when the election happened in 2016, it just seemed to me a dereliction of duty to not cover that election.\"",

            "article_content": "LAS VEGAS -- Former first lady Michelle Obama held a campaign-style rally Sunday in Las Vegas to urge Nevadans to register to vote and cast ballots this fall, warning them that sitting out means someone else will make decisions for them. The event was the first of two rallies the former first lady is scheduled to headline for the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization she co-chairs, When We All Vote. \"We get the leaders we vote for. We get the policies we vote for. And when we don't vote, that's when we wind up with government of, by and for other people,\" Obama told about 2,000 people inside a high school gymnasium. She has long been one of the most popular draws among Democrats. But she has kept a low profile since leaving the White House in January 2017. Obama has limited her political commitments for now to helping When We All Vote, which says it encourages participation regardless of political affiliation. It's unclear whether she will stump for Democratic candidates this year, but former President Barack Obama has made appearances in California and Ohio to support Democrats. He has also endorsed more than 80 Democrats up and down the ballot in more than a dozen states.  Michelle Obama did not make any overtly partisan appeals Sunday, telling people she didn't care who they vote for as long as they participate. She drew loud cheers and applause from the crowd when she mentioned her husband and when someone in the crowd suggested she seek the presidency herself.  Obama laughed and shook her head, saying, \"Stop this.\"  You can watch Obama's speech in the video provided here by CBS affiliate KLAS-TV. Other speakers at Sunday's event did not mention partisan politics. But they spoke about issues that are particularly key to Democratic electoral wins, like harnessing the political power of Latino communities and ensuring voter participation even in off-year, midterm elections, when Democratic turnout tends to lag behind Republican participation.  Actor and comedian Keegan-Michael Key came closest to delivering a partisan message, telling the crowd that America is at \"a very, very interesting time.\"  \"I'm sure many of you out here have been experiencing, let's call it, 'mild frustration,' \" he said.  He then urged the crowd to \"translate our outrage and our passion\" into change.  Other speakers included actress Kelly McCreary of ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy;\" actress Lana Parrilla of ABC's \"Once Upon a Time;\" journalist Maria Elena Salinas; and local first-time voters.  Mrs. Obama is scheduled to appear at another When We All Vote rally in Miami on Friday, while other celebrity co-chairs like country singer Faith Hill and actor Tom Hanks are scheduled to headline similar events around the country.  When We All Vote is holding the events to mark the 53rd anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. ",

            "article_content": "ALBANY, Ga. -- Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention are expelling a Georgia church that was accused of racial discrimination. The denomination's media office tweeted Monday that members of the executive committee had voted to withdraw fellowship from Raleigh White Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. The tweet says the church is being disassociated over \"clear evidence\" of racism. The church's local association severed ties earlier this year. The EC has voted, on behalf of the SBC, to withdraw fellowship from Raleigh White Baptist Church in Albany, Ga., based on 'clear evidence' of racial discrimination. #sbcam18 A phone message left at the church wasn't returned immediately. News reports say the majority white Raleigh White Baptist agreed in 2015 to share its building with the majority black New Seasons Church, which outgrew it in size. Reports say Raleigh White members blocked members of the black church from entering one Sunday in March, prompting action. The SBC has struggled to overcome its history as a denomination formed in defense of slaveholders. Southern Baptists' annual national meeting in Dallas opens Tuesday in an anxious mood as the denomination's all-male leadership grapples with the fallout of multiple sexual misconduct cases. One order of business is a draft resolution co-signed by dozens of SBC leaders calling on the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. to repudiate any rhetoric or behavior that dishonors women. The resolution denounces those who commit or cover up such actions, and urges congregations and ministers to abide by all laws mandating the reporting of sexual abuse and assault. In a late addition to the program, the SBC announced that Vice President Mike Pence would address the meeting on Wednesday. Not on the agenda in Dallas is any reconsideration of the SBC's doctrine of \"complementarianism,\" which espouses male leadership in the home and in the church and says a wife \"is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband.\" However, numerous SBC leaders are saying the doctrine needs to be observed in a way that's respectful of women and encourages them to play an active role in church affairs. In a recent video posted on Facebook, the Rev. J.D. Greear, one of two candidates to become the SBC's next president, said the church has hurt itself by excluding women from top leadership posts. Complementarianism \"is biblical and we need to honor that ... but at the same time recognize that God has gifted women with spiritual gifts,\" he said. \"We need to be as committed to raising them up in leadership and ministries as we are to our sons.\" Greear, 45, a megachurch pastor from North Carolina who sometimes preaches in jeans and shirts with no sport coat, faces pastor and former seminary president Ken Hemphill, 70, in the presidential election. Greear narrowly lost the election for president in 2016, and has been viewed by many Southern Baptists as the inevitable winner this time. Hemphill was nominated by some veteran SBC leaders who view him as less likely to propose potentially divisive changes. As the two-day meeting gets started, advocates of a greater role for women in the SBC plan a protest rally outside the convention center. Rally organizers want the SBC to create a database of clergy sex offenders and require all pastors and seminarians to undergo training on how to address domestic abuse and sexual assault. Paige Patterson, the central figure in the most prominent of the SBC's #MeToo cases, had been scheduled to deliver the featured sermon at the national meeting. However, he withdrew from that role Friday, heeding a request from other SBC leaders. Patterson was recently dismissed as president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas because of his response to two rape allegations made years apart by students. He also was accused of making improper remarks about a teenage girl's body and contending that women who are in abusive relationships should almost always stay with their husbands. SBC leaders say there are many more cases - adding up to a humiliating debacle for the 15.2 million-member denomination. \"The avalanche of sexual misconduct that has come to light in recent weeks is almost too much to bear,\" the Rev. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote in a recent blog post.",

            "article_content": "JOHANNESBURG -- Several thousand mourners gathered at Soweto's Orlando Stadium on Wednesday for the official memorial service for anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who died on April 2 at the age of 81. The death of Madikizela-Mandela, often called the \"Mother of the Nation,\" has triggered widespread soul-searching in South Africa over the legacy of one of the nation's most important fighters against racial discrimination, yet who was dogged by scandal. During the decades of imprisonment of her husband, Nelson Mandela, Madikizela-Mandela helped keep the plight of the political leader and the gross injustices of the apartheid system in the global spotlight, her own face and voice becoming synonymous with the anti-apartheid struggle. In the week since her death in a Johannesburg hospital, there has been an outpouring of support for a woman whose fearlessness and defiance helped bring end to the apartheid system, but whose public image was also tarnished by controversy. In a social media campaign \"Winnie has not died she has multiplied,\" scores of young women have posted pictures of themselves wearing doeks, the traditional head wrap that Madikizela-Mandela frequently wore. The ruling African National Congress, with which Madikizela-Mandela had a rocky relationship over the years, has held memorial events across the country, including Wednesday's ceremony and an official funeral scheduled on Saturday. \"She was a symbol of hope to many of us,\" President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a memorial in her hometown on Tuesday. The young Madikizela-Mandela grew up in what is now Eastern Cape province and came to Johannesburg as the city's first black female social worker. Not long after, she met ANC activist Nelson Mandela and the couple married in 1958, forming one of the most storied unions of the 21st century. After Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island, Madikizela-Mandela embraced her own leadership in the freedom struggle with steely determination and at great personal sacrifice. For years, she was routinely harassed by apartheid-state security forces, imprisoned and tortured. She was often away from her two daughters with Mandela, and in 1977, she was banished to a remote town in the middle of the country to separate her from the heart of the movement she led in Soweto. \"You decide to choose between the nation and your young children and it was a very difficult choice to make,\" Madikizela Mandela said in 2013. \"Even to this day, a parent like me still feels that guilt.\" Those years of harassment and stress were not without their toll. When Madikizela-Mandela returned from exile to Johannesburg, she became involved with a group of young men known as the Mandela United Football Club, who were widely blamed for violence in Soweto, where she was living. They were accused of the disappearances and killings of at least 18 boys and young men and the group's leader was convicted of killing a 14-year-old boy, nicknamed \"Stompie,\" who was accused of being a police informer. In 1991, a court found Madikizela-Mandela guilty of the boy's kidnapping and assault and sentenced her to six years in jail. She appealed and was found guilty of being an accessory in the assault, and the sentence was reduced to a fine and a suspended prison term. Madikizela-Mandela steadfastly denied any knowledge of any killings. Mandela divorced her in 1996, claiming infidelity and saying that after his release from prison, his wife made him \"the loneliest man.\" Though she fought fiercely for democracy, the political career that Madikizela-Mandela embarked on after the first free elections in 1994 floundered. Mandela sacked his wife as one of his deputy ministers in his first cabinet, and her stints as a lawmaker, a post she held until her death, were lackluster.",
