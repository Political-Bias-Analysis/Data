Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.<br> Joe Biden is touting his Catholic faith as groups are hitting him on issues held near and dear to the faithful and opposed by the church, including religious freedom for nuns and abortion. In an op-ed for the Christian Post, Biden wrote that\u00a0his Catholic faith guides his policies, including wearing masks to defeat the coronavirus pandemic, rooting\u00a0out systemic racism, ending the \"evil of poverty,\" welcoming immigrants, and doing \"everything in our power to ensure that all God\u2019s children have the hope and future they so rightfully deserve.\" In the vice-presidential debate, Kamala Harris said Biden would be the second practicing Roman Catholic president since JFK, as both campaigns seek to reach the key voting bloc in swing states. BIDEN LAUNCHES ADS TOUTING HIS FAITH AFTER CARDINAL SAYS HE'S 'NOT A CATHOLIC IN GOOD STANDING' Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association,\u00a0told Fox News Biden's candidacy has been confusing to Catholic voters \"who believe that being Catholic is more than just another label.\" \u201cJoe Biden has campaigned on his Catholic faith while promising policies that contradict Catholic teaching and even threatening the Little Sisters of the Poor,\"\u00a0McGuire said. \"The Bishops Conference has warned of the devastating consequences of the Equality Act for religious liberty and for girls and women but Joe Biden supports it.\" PROMINENT PASTOR GETS BACKLASH FOR EXPLAINING WHY HE ISN'T VOTING FOR TRUMP OR BIDEN On the issue of abortion, which Biden didn't mention Thursday discussing his devout faith, Lila Rose, founder and president of Live Action, an anti-abortion organization, tweeted a clear-cut message to the Democratic nominee. \"You cannot claim to be a practicing Catholic and support the slaughter of children in the womb. To do so is heinous and despicable. And you cannot claim you 'didn\u2019t know'\u00a0when your faith, and basic moral law, is telling you loud and clear: You shall not kill,\" Rose wrote. NUNS WEARING MAGA MASKS SPOTTED BEHIND TRUMP AT RALLY Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, a conservative political advocacy group, said Biden \"has put himself on a collision course with the Catholic Church by promising to pass the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his presidency.\" \"Biden's aggressive support of the Act, together with his extreme abortion position, opposition to school choice, and pledge to restart the war on the Little Sisters makes clear his Catholic faith will be readily sacrificed at the altar of political expediency,\" Burch added. \"Come Tuesday, Catholics must understand the existential threat posed by a Biden-Harris ticket. Donald Trump remains the best \u2013 and only \u2013 choice for Catholic voters this election.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Catholic vote has been almost evenly split between the two parties. According to Fox News' 2016 exit polls, 50% of Catholics who voted supported Trump and 46% cast their ballots for\u00a0then-candidate Hillary Clinton.",

            "article_content": " As the 2020 presidential election approaches, Latino and evangelical voters in Florida are finding themselves pulled to the polls by issues related to the regulation of abortion and illegal\u00a0immigration. Residents have reportedly been torn between backing certain immigration policies that embrace identity politics and social justice\u00a0versus elements of the pro-life movement, religious freedom\u00a0and Christianity that are being championed by President Trump,\u00a0according.to\u00a0The Tampa Bay Times. \u201cIt is our duty and job to defend the ethical and moral values that guide us,\u201d Puerto Rican evangelical Pastor Angel\u00a0Marcial said. \"And that must be done by voting.\" Marcial, 30, leads a congregation of parishioners at the evangelical Vertical Church in Largo. He also serves as the youth director for the Southeastern Hispanic Region of the Tennessee-based Church of God and said he's been working with Latinos who believe\u00a0a wedge is being driven between them and traditional evangelicals. He explained how important it is for both sides\u00a0to see each other's issues and recognize them, even if it may break from traditional norms. FLORIDA VOTER REGISTRATION WEBSITE EXPERIENCED OUTAGE HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE \u201cThat does not mean we do not think about our immigrant brothers who are suffering,\" the pastor added. Given Trump's Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, and her strong faith in Catholicism and the pro-life movement, Christian\u00a0Latino voters have found abortion has become central to their decision. However, other pockets of voters have expressed fear about Trump's policies with regard to the enforcement of federal\u00a0immigration laws, which some fear could result in mass deportations. Other pastors have taken a more apolitical\u00a0approach in the hope that parishioners and voters will make up their own minds and decide for themselves.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Facebook is reinstating advertising it previously blocked from an anti-abortion organization claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., supported abortion up until the moment of birth. \"We\u2019re working to reinstate the ads,\" Facebook's Devon Kearns told Fox News in an email Friday. The social media giant had blocked the ad\u00a0after The Dispatch, a conservative outlet run by former National Review editor Jonah Goldberg, issued a fact check that was later retracted on the ad. On Friday, the Susan B. Anthony List tweeted a screenshot of Facebook\u00a0explaining that one of the group's\u00a0ads, which ran in key battleground states, had been \"debunked\" and therefore couldn't run on the platform. BIG TECH CEOS CALLED TO TESTIFY WEDNESDAY BEFORE SENATE AMID CENSORSHIP UPROAR \"Ads must not include claims debunked by a third-party fact-checkers or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organizations with particular expertise,\" the message read. The email, titled \"Ad Can't Run: Update Ad,\"\u00a0suggested that SBA List could \"issue a correction\" or dispute the ban by reaching out to the third-party fact-checker rather than Facebook itself. In addition to blocking the ads, Facebook also placed a \"partly false\" warning label on a link to the ad. Amid backlash, The Dispatch issued a \"mea culpa\" on Friday in which it retracted the fact-check, and Facebook eventually removed the \"partly false\" label from\u00a0the post. Facebook label claims anti-abortion ad contains \"partly false information\" Regardless, the issue reignited concerns about social media bias.\u00a0Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, citing what he called \"an increasingly troubling pattern: it has become abundantly clear that Facebook is targeting voices that dissent from the national media's progressive consensus.\" SBA List's complaint came after Facebook and Twitter faced intense backlash for the way they censored a New York Post article on emails from a Burisma adviser to Hunter Biden and his former business partner. Conservatives like SBA List President Marjorie Danenfelser, who also leads the Trump campaign's \"Pro-Life Voices for Trump,\" have similarly claimed that tech companies have a habit of suppressing conservative viewpoints. Next Wednesday, the Senate is expected to hold a hearing on the issue with the Commerce Committee inviting leaders of Facebook, Twitter, and Google to testify.\u00a0Each have denied political bias. FACT-CHECKING GURU BLASTS TWITTER, FACEBOOK AS DANGEROUS 'ARBITERS OF TRUTH' AFTER CENSORING BIDEN ARTICLE The initial fact-check argued\u00a0that Biden and Harris hadn't explicitly supported late-term abortion. In The Dispatch's update, co-founder Steve Hayes said the fact-check was published in error, and in draft form, before final edits and internal fact-checking were completed. \"As a result, the viral post was assigned a 'partly false'\u00a0rating that we have determined is not justified after completing\u00a0The Dispatch\u00a0fact-checking process,\" Hayes said. In August, a\u00a0Snopes fact-check similarly said Harris hadn't explicitly stated that she supports the termination of a pregnancy at any time just before birth.\" But anti-abortion advocates like Alexandra DeSanctis, a staff writer at National Review, stay hey don't have to be explicit since their policy stances allow for late-term abortions to take place. CALIFORNIA AG PLEDGES NOT TO PROSECUTE WOMEN FOR ABORTION IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED Both DeSanctis and SBA List spokesperson\u00a0Mallory Quigley pointed to the Democratic nominee's support for codifying Roe v. Wade, a move that many states and Democratic presidential candidates endorsed amid a raft of anti-abortion laws. Vice President Mike Pence made a similar claim about late-term abortion during his debate with Harris, asserting that Biden supported repealing the Hyde Amendment, which would allow taxpayer funds for abortions up until birth. While Roe legalized abortion early in a\u00a0pregnancy, it left open exceptions for life and health of the mother at later gestational ages. The decision in Doe v. Bolton, released on the same day in 1973 as Roe v. Wade, argued that life and health of the mother encompassed a wide range of reasons.\u00a0 In his majority opinion, former Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that \"medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health.\" The Guttmacher Institute, which promotes abortion access and studies the issue,\u00a0analyzed\u00a0survey data of 272 women who underwent an abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. It concluded in 2013 that \"[m]ost women seeking later abortion fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous.\" BARRETT SAYS ROE V. WADE IS NOT A 'SUPER PRECEDENT' THAT CANNOT BE OVERTURNED The Democratic Party has also faced internal pushback for its position on abortion restrictions. It specifically supports codifying Roe v. Wade and opposes\u00a0\"laws that create barriers to women\u2019s reproductive health and rights.\" In criticizing Trump's comments on late-term abortion, The Washington Post previously cited a Northwestern University professor who said \"'abortion until the moment of birth' doesn't exist.\" \"[I]t\u2019s a boogeyman abortion opponents have created to frighten voters and derail rational conversation about constitutional rights,\u201d said Katie L. Watson, a professor at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine.\u00a0\u201cNobody \u2018supports\u2019 it, and nobody does it. No patient ever asks a physician to end her pregnancy \u2018the moment before birth,\u2019 and no physician would agree to do it.\u201d While it's unclear when each abortion occurs, the Centers for Disease Control has reported that at least 143 babies died between 2003-2014\u00a0in cases involving induced termination. The agency noted that could be an underestimate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Additional reporting and statements have raised questions about infants born alive after abortion attempts. For example, the Center for Medical Progress promoted videos in July showing a Planned Parenthood executive admitting in a deposition that his affiliate in California saw an infant born alive and then die \"seconds\" after the child left the mother's womb.\u00a0Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the medical director who infamously discussed \"crush[ing]\" fetuses\u00a0in a way that would yield intact\u00a0tissue,\u00a0also said she was \"sure\" she'd seen nonviable fetuses exit the uterus. By nonviable, she meant \"not capable of survival.\" It's unclear when those abortions occurred as Planned Parenthood has performed them at various gestational ages while obtaining fetal tissue. State health data has also\u00a0shown that dozens of babies -- at least 40 -- were born alive after botched abortions in three states since 2016. Fox News' Fred Lucas contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Kanye West weighs in on Planned Parenthood and how his mother refused to abort him as a baby at his first presidential rally in South Carolina. The anti-abortion movement is pouring substantial resources into upcoming elections, having been galvanized by President Trump, who has purportedly shifted the political landscape to make the issue a winner in November. On Monday, canvassers for the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) List will deploy to Wisconsin \u2014\u00a0decided by a 0.77 percent\u00a0vote gap in the 2016 presidential race \u2014\u00a0in an attempt to sway a narrow margin of voters to support anti-abortion politicians. In total, the organization's paid canvassers have already visited more than 1.1 million\u00a0homes and aim to reach more in critical battleground states Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Arizona, and Michigan\u00a0before Nov. 3. Students for Life of America (SFLA), the National Right to Life Committee, Concerned Women for America, the Family Research Council\u00a0(FRC)\u00a0and others are flexing their activism arms \u2014\u00a0501c(4)s \u2014\u00a0to warn about candidates\u2019 stances on abortion. SFLA specifically plans to make 1\u00a0million phone calls, knock on 250,000 doors\u00a0and register voters on 153 college campuses. Because of COVID-19, it\u2019s leveraging digital efforts to reach 21 million voters under the age of 30. Like the above groups, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Trump campaign plan to emphasize what they see as Democrats\u2019 \u201cextreme\u201d views on the issue. \u201cGenerally, internal data shows that voters\u2019 views on abortion don\u2019t tend to change year over year,\u201d RNC national press secretary Mandi Merritt said. \u201cHowever, we do consistently see polling that shows Americans do not support the fringe extreme views that Biden has endorsed.\u201d SENATORS PRESS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON PAIR OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD CONTROVERSIES A confluence of factors has led to what SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, who also chairs the campaign\u2019s \u201cPro-Life Voices for Trump,\u201d sees as the most consequential election in her lifetime. That\u2019s probably why Planned Parenthood Votes,\u00a0 which represents the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, has committed $45 million for its largest electoral effort to date. It recently announced seven-figure efforts for Pennsylvania and Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is weathering criticism over her support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \"Poll after poll shows that voters want champions for reproductive health \u2014 including the right to access a safe and legal abortion \u2014 in public office,\" the group said in July.\u00a0\"Politicians who want to take those rights away aren\u2019t just pursuing bad policy, but a losing political strategy.\" Both sides have credited Planned Parenthood Votes with former anti-abortion Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., losing earlier this year -- something Kristen Day, head of Democrats for Life, framed as a sign of the party\u2019s alleged drift from moderation. Carrying a similar message, Vice President Mike Pence recently campaigned in Florida, highlighting\u00a0what activists describe as Democrats\u2019 extreme stances on abortion. Pence wrote the introduction to Dannenfelser\u2019s forthcoming book, \u201cLife is Winning,\u201d in which she boldly proclaims that, regardless of whether he wins, former Vice President Joe Biden will be \u201cAmerica\u2019s last thoroughly pro-abortion presidential candidate.\u201d \u201cIt is like every other human and civil rights issue that has gone on for too long in a nation. We are at that breaking point,\u201d Dannenfelser told Fox News. However, Democrats maintain abortion access is a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and describe the Hyde Amendment, which blocks taxpayer funding of most abortions, as a discriminatory barrier to marginalized women. Under pressure from his own party, Biden reversed his decades-old position on Hyde, saying women shouldn\u2019t be denied access due to their ability to pay. He\u2019s also pledged to reverse Trump\u2019s decision to reinstate a policy banning overseas funding for groups that perform or promote abortion. Polling\u00a0has\u00a0reportedly shown support for its repeal. But January\u00a0polling from Marist, in conjunction with the Knights of Columbus, showed about 60 percent of Americans oppose domestic taxpayer funding of abortion. The percentage grew to 75 percent\u00a0when discussing overseas funding. PENCE RIPS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS IN INTERVIEW, CALLS HIM 'DISAPPOINTMENT TO CONSERVATIVES' Biden\u2019s also backed by Democratic leaders who have responded to conservative judicial victories by moving to codify Roe v. Wade; something already approved by New York state and included in a draft platform for the Democratic National Committee (DNC). While some social conservatives bristle at Trump\u2019s brash behavior, Dannenfelser sees his bluntness as an avenue for\u00a0clarity in\u00a0the abortion debate. Both she and SFLA President Kristan Hawkins praised Trump for telling former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton she would allow doctors to \u201crip the baby out of the womb\u201d in the final month of pregnancy. \u201cI had counseled dozens of candidates from the presidential level down to the state legislature. Not one did a better job of communicating the visceral horror of abortion,\u201d Dannenfelser, who has spent decades in the movement, wrote of Trump. \u201cMitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, even Ronald Reagan had been given on a national stage many opportunities to authentically witness to the depravity and extremism of abortion; all had shied away.\u201d According to her book, it was Trump who pushed for stronger wording in a 2016 letter announcing his anti-abortion commitments. And it was Trump who made the \u201cmost explicit\u201d remarks on the issue at a State of the Union address. Dannenfelser was with Trump before that event. \u201cThe first issue\u201d he brought up to Dannenfelser and his advisers was Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s comments about letting infants die after surviving abortions. PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST LAUDS KANYE WEST'S VIEWS ON ABORTION: 'HE'S SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS TRUE' Dannenfelser\u2019s book describes Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as two of the movement\u2019s \u201cgreatest champions.\u201d But she also describes how both of them declined to take on anti-abortion legislation when she approached them about it. For Rubio, she writes:\u00a0\"Energized by his passionate defense of life, I asked him in 2013 to lead the fight in the Senate for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Surprisingly, he declined. He had been burned by an earlier failed effort to move forward on an immigration reform bill and was reluctant to take the lead on this issue without 'all the ducks being in a row,'\u00a0including unrealistic assurances about possible future constitutional rulings on the issue.\" Rubio\u2019s office did not immediately provide comment. Dannenfelser also recalls how in the 2016 cycle, Walker \u201cdemurred\u201d from her request that he embrace state and national bans on late-term abortion. When she pressed him on a five-month ban making its way through Wisconsin, he allegedly said, \u201cpeople back home aren\u2019t talking about this.\u201d A spokesperson for Walker told Fox News: \"Governor Walker has a strong pro-life record based on his belief in the sanctity of life of the unborn child. The Governor has spoken to countless people about this record, and he\u2019ll continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the pro-life movement to fight for these values.\" Trump\u00a0seemed to also favor pragmatism when he decided\u00a0not to veto a budget\u00a0that included congressional funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) \u2014\u00a0something Dannenfelser defended to Fox News. His re-election effort will also likely be dominated not by abortion, but concerns about COVID-19 and how the pandemic cut into the explosive economic growth he saw in his first term. The RNC\u2019s field program generally highlights abortion if targeted voters care about that issue. \u201cHowever,\u201d Merritt said, \u201cthe major issues we are seeing right now that are resonating with voters are protecting the economy and defending law and order.\u201d HAWLEY VOWS TO VOTE AGAINST SUPREME COURT NOMINEES WHO HAVEN'T 'EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ROE V. WADE WAS WRONGLY DECIDED' Sarah Chamberlain, a GOP strategist, told Fox News: \u201cI talk to couple hundred women around the country every week and abortion does not come up.\u201d One of her projects, Women2Women Conversations Tour,\u00a0interviews suburban women and amasses data about their concerns before elections. \u201cThe number one, two, and three issue is health care,\u201d she said, noting heightened concern about children\u2019s psychological suffering from shuttering schools during the pandemic. Eliminating pre-existing conditions, she added, was \u201cnot even open for discussion\u201d as women worried about losing cover under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). PPFA and other groups have tied that issue more generally to abortion, claiming Republicans deprive women of \u201cbasic health care.\u201d While PPFA\u2019s public image centers on abortion and contraception, the group has used its myriad of other services to imply that defunding efforts threaten health more generally \u2014\u00a0mental health included. Polling has shown over time, that voters tend to support some, but not all, restrictions on abortion. In May, for example, Gallup found that 50 percent\u00a0of voters thought abortion should be legal only under certain circumstances, as opposed to any (29 percent) or none (20 percent). That ranking of preferences reflected Gallup\u2019s historical data as well. And while a plurality say abortion is \u201cimmoral,\u201d moderates (55 percent) tend to identify as pro-choice. But Dannenfelser is confident that when it comes time to vote, a solid portion of Americans will be voting with the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0as a priority. Exit polling from 2016 seemed to bear out as the majority who saw Trump's nominating power as the most important factor lent him their vote. For both Clinton and Trump voters, a sizeable\u00a0viewed court nominations as either important or their most important \u2014\u00a0with eight\u00a0percent more Trump voters rating it as their most important. Just months before the election, conservatives were disappointed by a series of Supreme Court decisions joined by GOP-appointed justices \u2014\u00a0prompting speculation that it wasn't a valid reason to support Trump.\u00a0But Dannenfelser said\u00a0voters\u00a0told her group they\u00a0weren't disillusioned with Trump's justices, and continued worrying about the issue as a factor in their vote. On actual policy, the two sides of the abortion debate have polarized to the point that voters may feel like they\u2019re choosing whoever\u2019s \u201cless extreme.\u201d States like Missouri and Georgia have implemented restrictions as far back as six weeks into pregnancy. Alabama, meanwhile, eliminated exceptions for rape and incest \u2014\u00a0provisions that both Trump and the RNC chairwoman have, in some way, expressed\u00a0opposition toward. DEMOCRATS FACE INTRAPARTY RESISTANCE OVER HYDE AMENDMENT AS LEADERSHIP PURSUES REPEAL On the other side, former Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a perceived moderate former\u00a0presidential candidate, echoed\u00a0Northam in resisting mandates on lifesaving care for infants who survived abortions. As if to underscore the emotions involved, SFLA and FRC Action plan to utilize baby clothes in their messaging. In September, FRC Action will deliver 90,000 baby hats to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\u00a0while SFLA intends to send its participating members baby socks. Dannenfelser indicated that disgust over stances like Northam\u2019s and opposition to Hyde could move enough persuadable voters\u00a0to help Trump win the slim victories often found in battlegrounds like Wisconsin. An SFLA effort similarly aims to make abortion a first-order issue for students heading to the ballot box. The two organizations are teaming up to train students, as well as share data that identifies more than 2 million \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters of all ages in six key states. \u201cWho you talk to is even more important than what you say,\u201d Dannenfelser told Fox News. SBA\u2019s internal data purports to show higher turnout among those contacted by the organization in swing states during the last three election cycles. Targeted Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, Dannenfelser said, also tend to move an average of 7% in response to the group\u2019s microtargeting. Even if anti-abortion groups fail to persuade Democrats toward\u00a0Trump, the group might be able to at least stop them from voting for Biden. Reflecting on Lipinski\u2019s loss, Day previously suggested to Fox News that anti-abortion Democrats might just sit out the next election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to a June Gallup report, 24 percent Democrats consider themselves pro-life. January\u2019s Marist poll also showed 44 percent of Democrats said they were \"more likely to vote for\" candidates who would limit abortion to the first trimester. As Dannenfelser noted, the 2016 election came down to roughly 77,000 votes in three states.\u00a0She added: \u201cThat\u2019s why all of these things on the margins make such an enormous difference.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Is Biden's change in stance a political strategy? Project 21 co-chair Horace Cooper and civil rights attorney Leo Terrell weigh in. A group of Democrats is calling on the party to moderate\u00a0the platform's\u00a0support for abortion\u00a0 as leadership pressed taxpayer funding for the procedure before the 2020 elections. This week, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., moved to strike the decades-old provision and Democrats for Life (DFL)\u00a0released a letter supporting it. \"A diverse coalition of 115 religious leaders, clergy, and theologians today sent a letter calling on the Democratic Party to moderate its platform\u2019s position on abortion,\" read Friday's letter from DFL. \"Specifically, the religious leaders urge the Party Platform Committee to remove extreme abortion policies, which will make it more inclusive towards pro-life voters and moderate voters of faith.\" The group notes that a Marist poll\u00a0showed six in ten Americans opposing taxpayer-funded abortions. Passed in 1976, the historically bipartisan amendment has blocked most Medicaid funding for abortions -- with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. PRO-LIFE DEM CLASHES WITH BUTTIGIEG AT TOWN HALL: 'WE DON'T BELONG' A draft platform obtained by Politico showed the party proposing Hyde's repeal and excluding language about gestational age restrictions. \"Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high\u00a0quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion. We oppose and will\u00a0fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women\u2019s reproductive health and\u00a0rights, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment and protecting and codifying Roe v. Wade,\" the draft platform read. DFL's Kristen Day has denounced that framework as wildly out of step with most Democrats, nevermind most Americans. In January, Day made headlines after she confronted former presidential candidate and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg over his position on the party's platform. \"In 1996 and several years after that there was language in the Democratic platform that said 'we understand that people have very differing views on this issue but we are a big tent party that includes everybody and therefore we welcome you -- people like me -- into the party so we can work on issues that we agree on,'\" she said. Buttigieg, who seemed to equivocate on infants who survive abortions, told Day that he supported his party's position. But in recent years, the abortion debate has become even more polarized as a series of states faced tense battles over a myriad of regulations\u00a0on the procedure. Anticipating a conservative Supreme Court decision, several states and presidential candidates proposed legislation that would codify the Court's landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade. DAN LIPINSKI'S LOSS SEEN AS TURNING POINT FOR PRO-LIFE DEMS, BLOW TO BIG TENT POLITICS In the 2020 election cycle, Democratic activists have framed the issue as one of racial and health equity. After nearly every other Democratic candidate opposed Hyde,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden reversed his decades-long support for the measure. Pressley advanced repeal on Thursday as a way to take on different forms of oppression. \"We are in a moment of reckoning and transformation as a nation,\" Pressley said\u00a0in a Medium post. \"Without a doubt, now is the moment to dismantle systems of oppression and take a stand against racist and discriminatory policies. Empty gestures are not enough.\" She reiterated the pro-choice argument that Hyde disproportionately burdens people of color, who may be less likely to\u00a0afford abortions compared to their White counterparts. Along with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and others, Pressley filed an amendment to remove Hyde provisions from a federal spending bill. It's unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate or make it past President Trump, who has implemented an aggressive anti-abortion agenda at the executive level. PRO-LIFE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN WARY OF TRUMP AT MARCH FOR LIFE, DISAPPOINTED IN DEM LEADERSHIP \"Black and brown people cannot afford to wait another budget cycle for their humanity and dignity to be recognized,\" she said. \"In this moment of profound national reckoning, Congress must right the wrongs of the past and make reproductive autonomy a guaranteed right for everyone.\" To be clear, Hyde does not automatically\u00a0prohibit access to abortion but rather blocks federal funds for obtaining one. The heightened focus on race has also prompted Planned Parenthood of New York to distance itself from its the organization's\u00a0founder, Margaret Sanger,\u00a0who worked to reduce Black population growth. Black anti-abortion leaders recently\u00a0told Fox News that the widespread use of the procedure itself was racist and continued Sanger's legacy. According to Planned Parenthood, the Hyde Amendment has a disproportionate impact on women of color -- 30 percent of Black women and 24 percent of Hispanic women are enrolled in Medicaid, along with 14 percent of White women. Terrisa Bukovinac, an atheist who sits on DFL's board, told Fox News that Pressley's position was \"severely problematic.\" MEET THE PRO-LIFE DEMOCRAT BEHIND ONE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL CASES FOR 2020 \"Rep. Pressley\u2019s attempt to paint a truly life-saving amendment, one designed specifically to protect black, brown, and underprivileged people from being coerced by the state into choosing abortion, is severely problematic,\" said Bukovinac, who also leads Secular Pro-Life and Pro-Life San Francisco. \"The Hyde amendment has saved more than 2 million lives that are disproportionately black and brown. Suggesting that these people are better off dead is itself an expression of the white supremacist ideals that gave birth to the abortion industry in the first place! The American people deserve better than state sanctioned violence against their own offspring and the majority of Democrats agree. Taking a position against Hyde is a losing one.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this week, the Charlotte Lozier Institute\u00a0released an addendum to a 2016\u00a0study\u00a0estimating that Hyde restrictions had saved more around 2.13 million unborn children since its passage in 1976. That translated into about\u00a060,000 lives per year. Scholar Michael New wrote: \"I estimate that the Hyde Amendment \u00a0saved 63,549 lives in 2016; 63,549 lives in 2017; 59,707 lives in 2018; 60,067 lives in 2019; and 29,713 lives in 2020 (as of July 1).

The former governor's comments come after\u00a0Trump told Fox News\u00a0correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, on Thursday that Biden, a practicing\u00a0Roman\u00a0Catholic, and the Democrats are \"against the Bible\"\u00a0and claimed that\u00a0the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is \"against God.\" The Biden campaign hit Trump\u00a0in response over his photo in front of St. John's Church amid police brutality protests and as the Republican president seeks to shore up his evangelical base. \"Joe Biden's faith is at the core of who he is; he's lived it with dignity his entire life, and it's been a source of strength and comfort in times of extreme hardship,\" Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News. \"Donald Trump is the only president in our history to have tear-gassed peaceful Americans and thrown a priest out of her\u00a0church just so he could profane it -- and a Bible -- for his own cynical optics as he sought to tear our nation apart at a moment of crisis and pain.\" CONSERVATIVE CATHOLICS CALL ON BIDEN TO BREAK 'DEFINING SILENCE' ON ANTI-CATHOLIC VANDALISM The fight between the two comes as a Catholic group publically criticized Biden for his silence\u00a0on the \"rising climate of anti-Catholicism across the country\u201d and his failure to address the issue on the national stage. Huckabee praised Trump for being a \"champion\u00a0for religious liberty,\" contrasting him to Biden, who he called \"a champion for the\u00a0left.\" Huckabee later addressed a recent op-ed published on Politico headlined\u00a0\"Could These Evangelical Democrats Change the Party?\" The column suggests that religious voters are \"horrified by Trump and hope to pull their fellow Christians away from the GOP,\" a sentiment Huckabee called \"wishful thinking on the part of the media.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"\u00a0I read\u00a0that and thought 'this is wishful\u00a0thinking on the part of the\u00a0media,'\" he said. \"This is where leftists are\u00a0trying to gin up this idea that\u00a0somehow, Joe Biden is appealing\u00a0to people of faith.\u00a0That\u2019s utter nonsense.\u00a0I don\u2019t know of anybody, people\u00a0of faith, who think Joe Biden is\u00a0a great choice. \"Now, granted,\" Huckabee acknowledged, \"some of them\u00a0aren\u2019t happy with everything\u00a0Donald Trump says or tweets,\u00a0but I tell you, they\u2019re not going\u00a0to go with Biden.

As the nation waits for the courts and others to sift through the results of the election,\u00a0one thing is indisputable,\u00a0the only wave in 2020\u00a0was\u00a0the election of\u00a0conservative\u00a0women\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0House of Representatives. Conservative women candidates laid the groundwork early for keeping seats being vacated by male Republican members and flipping seats occupied by liberal women who were beholden to Planned Parenthood and the leftist agenda of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Their efforts paid off. No amount of money from the left\u2019s political donation machine was enough to win these seats. The power of the conservative message won the day. DOUG SCHOEN: BIDEN DELIVERS OPTIMISTIC SPEECH, NOW HE WILL NEED TO LEAD AND GOVERN AS A CENTRIST By Election Day, pollsters and pundits\u00a0were\u00a0predicting\u00a0Democrats would pick up five to\u00a020\u00a0House\u00a0seats. They\u00a0considered districts like Republican Ann Wagner\u2019s St. Louis suburb\u00a0one of those.\u00a0Quite the opposite\u00a0has\u00a0happened.\u00a0Only\u202fthree\u202fdistricts have flipped to\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats,\u202ftwo\u202fpredicted as a result of redistricting in North Carolina,\u202fthe other a competitive open seat in Georgia. On the other side of the aisle, all 11 Republican women running for reelection have prevailed, including Wagner against a female challenger in her suburban district. By the latest count, Republican women have already more than doubled their ranks in the House Republican caucus. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Six of the eight congressional districts flipped by the GOP so far have been won by conservative women in Florida, South Carolina, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Iowa and Minnesota. Seven other conservative women have replaced retiring members in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Tennessee. Of these 13 decided races, 10 conservative women defeated female challengers, proving the appeal of the conservative message over the progressive liberalism peddled by Pelosi and the Squad. The count continues \u2013 at least six more races involving Republican women are all but final.\u202fFemale candidates in two districts in California and two in New York have strong leads and are expected to flip Democrat seats, adding to the wave. We at Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee (CWALAC) are not surprised by this wave of conservative women winning elections. In the final weeks, Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation amplified our brand of American women on the national stage. By electing more of our own, conservative women have spoken. CWALAC traveled over 8,000 miles across America in a big pink \u201cWomen for Amy\u201d bus, energizing women in support of our new Supreme Court justice and galvanizing participation in this election through our She Prays She Votes campaign. Women (and men) in every city in every battleground state we visited displayed a vitality for the issues that translated into results. Indeed, Barrett\u2019s confirmation broke through a concrete barrier that had marginalized female voices. The battle fought in Washington, D.C., energized women of faith and conviction across America in the final weeks.\u00a0At the same time, women rejected the leftist agenda ceding our cities to violence. Many of these wins were in suburban districts. Women across America deserve an agenda that respects our faith, empowers our families, protects our dignity and upholds the Constitution. American women are tired of the left claiming they stand for all women. The female victors in these districts are representing conservative women who live by our values, even if cancel culture seeks to silence our voices. Women spoke in this election against the bankrupt ideologies of identity politics, socialist objectives and a radical abortion agenda that cares more about killing unborn babies than caring for women faced with unplanned pregnancies. The bottom line in this election: conservative women\u00a0like those we represent\u00a0won congressional districts across America. We are women who reject being enslaved by\u00a0the\u00a0abortion industry and\u00a0decades of\u00a0insidious Hollywood exploitation\u00a0that\u00a0has\u00a0defined feminism for too long. We are women who stand for the rule of law in our cities. We are women who embrace\u00a0our\u00a0families and our faith. We are women who are not willing to exchange our rights to privacy, safety and equal opportunity by allowing biological men to appropriate our female status, whether it be in women\u2019s violence shelters or in women\u2019s sports. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When the 117th\u00a0Congress is sworn in next year, the House Democratic majority, likely led again by Speaker Pelosi, better heed these women. The radical leftist agenda driven by the ACLU and NARAL activists is going nowhere. Women across America deserve an agenda that respects our faith, empowers our families, protects our dignity and upholds the Constitution. Conservative women have spoken in this election, and our voices will not be silenced. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM PENNY YOUNG NANCE",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Voters in 32 states were asked to weigh in on more than 100 statewide ballot measures on Election Day, bypassing the usual legislative process for majority-rule policies. Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into campaigns to sway voters for or against such measures when they showed up to elect the next president and candidates vying in other races. Here are a few of the most closely-watched initiatives. Abortion Voters elected whether or not to restrict abortion in Louisiana and Colorado. Colorado asked voters in Proposition 115 whether or not they\u2019d like to approve a ban on abortions after 22 weeks, except to save the life of the mother. Violations would lead to up to a $5,000 penalty, but only for the doctor who performed the procedure. Colorado voters overwhelmingly snubbed the measure, according to Associated Press projections, 58.7 to 41.3 with 90 percent of precincts reporting. Louisiana\u2019s proposal, Proposed Amendment no. 1, would amend the state\u2019s constitution to specify that no such right to abortion exists. Voters approved the amendment 62 to 38 percent, according to projections. Should states get more of a say with abortion rights under a cemented conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Louisiana state courts would have less power to strike down anti-abortion laws with an amended constitution. 19 BALLOT MEASURES TO WATCH THIS ELECTION DAY Drugs Marijuana legalization measures are set to pass in five states thanks to ballot questions. New Jersey and Arizona residents voted yes on ballot measures to legalize cannabis for recreational use, and voters in Montana approved a measure and constitutional amendment to legalize the drug\u2019s use beginning January 2022. In a nationwide first, South Dakota voted to legalize medical and recreational marijuana at the same time. Voters in Mississippi approved an initiative to allow medical marijuana for those with debilitating conditions. Oregon took it a step further, becoming the first U.S. state to decriminalize all drugs. The Associated Press projected the measure passing with 83 percent of precincts reporting, 58.6 to 41.4 percent. CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS Residents can no longer be arrested for possessing small amounts of substances such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine or LSD. Instead, they face a maximum fine of $100 or must attend an addiction recovery center. The centers will be funded by millions in tax revenue from Oregon\u2019s legalized, regulated marijuana industry. Taxes In Illinois, voters rejected adopting a graduated tax income rate that would replace the state\u2019s flat-income tax structure. Demorat Gov. J.B. Pritzker had campaigned heavily in favor of the measure, putting up $56.5 million. Billionaire Ken Griffin donated most of the $50 million that has been raised to defeat it, according to reports. The measure is projected to fail with 98 percent of precincts reporting, 54.1 to 45.9. Colorado was the only state to give voters the option to lower their taxes, and they took advantage of it. Colorado\u2019s Proposition 116 will permanently lower the state\u2019s income tax rate from 4.63 to 4.55 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1 of this year. BALLOT MEASURES: CALIFORNIANS VOTED AGAINST BRINGING BACK AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, FOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS With 90 percent reporting, the measure passed 57.6 to 42.4. Arizona voted to raise taxes on the wealthy with Proposition 208, which will create an 8 percent top state income tax rate on income above $250,000 up from 4.5 percent currently. Californians voted against raising commercial tax rates. Proposition 15, an effort to remove high-value commercial properties from the low-tax protections dealt to homeowners and agricultural land, was projected to lose by AP-- with 72 percent reporting, \u201cno\u201d votes were ahead 51.7 to 58.3. Critics argue California\u2019s pandemic-induced recession is the wrong time to raise taxes on businesses.",

            "article_content": "Justice\u2019s death brings charges of hypocrisy. Friday\u2019s death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman on the U.S. Supreme Court and a trailblazer of enormous legal and gender advancements, promises to dramatically alter not only the dynamics of this year\u2019s presidential campaign, but also the direction of the high court and nation for generations. Even during her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993, Ginsburg pulled no punches on her unabashed support of abortion. \u201cIt is essential to a woman\u2019s equality with man that she be the decision maker, that the choice be controlling,\u201d she told the committee, ironically chaired by then-Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. SEN. TED CRUZ: AFTER GINSBURG\u00a0-- 3 REASONS WHY SENATE MUST CONFIRM HER SUCCESSOR BEFORE ELECTION DAY \u201cIf you impose restraints, you are disadvantaging her because of sex.\u201d Just over 27 years later, the issue of abortion and the fate of the infamous\u202fRoe v. Wade\u202fdecision of 1973 remain unresolved, hotly debated and highly controversial. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER That\u2019s because when decisions are either wrongly or inadequately settled, they never really go away. They simmer and seethe, like shifting, tectonic plates beneath the earth\u2019s surface. No nation that aborts 63\u00a0million\u00a0of its children can ever fully reach its potential or truly enjoy God\u2019s favor. President Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency\u00a0in 2016 was largely attributed to his campaign promise to appoint judges to the Supreme Court who would faithfully interpret the Constitution\u00a0as it was originally intended\u00a0and ultimately, overturn the horror of\u202fRoe. He must now make good on that promise again by appointing a woman or man who recognizes that the right to life promised by our Founders applies to everyone, even the\u00a0pre-born. Over the past four years, I have regularly encountered friends and listeners of my radio program who have told me they voted for Trump for that very reason \u2013 and that reason alone. In fact, women are especially vocal, telling me they struggled pulling the lever for the president, but ultimately saw in him the best champion to right the evil wrongs being perpetuated on innocent children. It\u2019s this fervor and faith in the president\u2019s commitment to life that demands he quickly nominate a successor to the late Justice Ginsburg, and that the U.S. Senate commence hearings and then swiftly confirm the appointee. Call it coincidence or divine timing, but the issue of life is now the major subject of this year\u2019s hotly contested election. Former Vice President Joe Biden and a chorus of others are demanding the vacancy remain open until after Jan. 20, 2021. Yet, in 2016, Biden voiced opposition to that very tactic. \u201cI made it absolutely clear that I would go forward with the confirmation process as chairman even a few months before a presidential election,\u201d the then vice president declared. Charges of hypocrisy are being leveled at Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who kept Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat open during the campaign of 2016. But this time around, Republicans hold the reins of both the Senate and the presidency, circumstances enabled by citizens who indicated by their votes a desire for pro-life judges. As this year\u2019s election has heated up,\u00a0Biden has made Trump\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic the centerpiece of his campaign, even suggesting all of the nearly 200,000 deaths attributable to the virus are the president\u2019s fault. Setting aside the veracity of such an accusation, Biden has, in essence, made life and death the focal point of 2020, and rightly so. I applaud him for his prioritization of the issues. Human life\u202fremains\u202fthe paramount issue for all American families and American evangelicals. Yet, if\u00a0Biden is understandably burdened by 200,000 deaths, shouldn\u2019t he be exponentially more aggrieved by the 63 million lives lost since\u202fRoe? Call it coincidence or divine timing, but the issue of life is now the major subject of this year\u2019s hotly contested election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As a pro-life Christian many miles apart from the late Justice Ginsburg\u2019s judicial philosophy, I nevertheless honor her life and public service. But the best way to honor life, in my estimation, is to do whatever I can to preserve and protect the most innocent lives, which in mine and millions of other\u2019s estimations, are those inside the womb. Today commences a battle\u00a0royale\u00a0of matchless importance in the public square\u00a0\u2013\u00a0six fateful weeks that will determine America\u2019s future.

The nation's highest-ranking military officer said the armed forces\u00a0will have \"no role\" in the 2020 presidential election or resolving any disputes, because courts and Congress have that responsibility. Gen.\u00a0Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told two members of Congress in a letter that he \"deeply\" believes in the principle of an \"apolitical\" U.S. military and\u00a0intends to keep the military out of any\u00a0election dispute. BIDEN SAYS TRUMP WILL ATTEMPT TO 'STEAL' PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \u201cIn the event of a dispute over some aspects of the election, by law U.S. courts and the U.S. Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the U.S. Military,\u201d Milley wrote. \u201cI foresee no role for the U.S. Armed Forces in this process.\u201d Milley also said: \"I will not follow an unlawful order.\" Milley, the principal military adviser to the president, Secretary of Defense and National Security Council, was responding\u00a0to questions raised by members of the House Armed Services Committee. They\u00a0were concerned about President Trump's comments that he would deploy the military for domestic political\u00a0purposes to quash protests. Lately, Trump has also suggested sending law enforcement to polling places, too. JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN MILLEY SAYS IT WAS 'MISTAKE' TO APPEAR WITH TRUMP IN LAFAYETTE SQUARE Reps.\u00a0Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.,\u00a0and Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., issued a joint statement welcoming the commitments Milley made in writing. They praised his pledges\u00a0to \"protect the military\u2019s apolitical status, avoid military involvement in the election process, respect the peaceful transition of presidential authority under the Constitution and refuse to obey any unlawful orders.\" FILE - In this June 1, 2020 file photo, President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit outside St. John's Church, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. Walking behind Trump from left are, Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley says his presence created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. He called it \"a mistake\" that he has learned from. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper both expressed regret for accompanying\u00a0Trump on\u00a0a photo op in front of St. John's Church near the White House, where he held up a Bible. Law enforcement forcibly cleared Lafayette Square of racial justice protesters ahead of the D.C. curfew in advance of Trump's short walk\u00a0to the\u00a0church. Milley, who was in uniform for the June 1 photo, called his presence \"a mistake\" because it gave the impression the military supports Trump's domestic political agenda. \u201cThat sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society,\u201d Milley said in a video in June. \u201cI should not have been there.\" Democrats have raised concerns that if Trump loses in November he might\u00a0refuse to leave the White House. They've\u00a0pointed to Trump's repeated statements aimed at discrediting the validity of the election by making unsubstantiated claims\u00a0that universal mail-in voting\u00a0is rife with fraud and by\u00a0suggesting\u00a0that the election should be delayed altogether over election security. PELOSI RIPS TRUMP FOR TRYING TO 'SCARE' VOTERS: 'DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING' \"It\u2019s my greatest concern, my single greatest concern,\" Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in an interview in June with\u00a0\"The Daily Show.\"\u00a0\u00a0\"This president is going to try to steal this election. This is a guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent ... while he sits behind the desk in the Oval Office and writes his mail-in ballot to vote in a primary.\" Biden suggested the military might have to\u00a0get involved to remove Trump from the White House. \u201cI promise you,\u201d he\u00a0said, \u201cI am absolutely convinced [the military] will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.\u201d Milley, however, sought to make clear that the military will stay out of elections and the transfer of power. He said he does not want the military at polling places or involved in determining the outcome, either. \u201cWe follow the rule of law and have done so with regard to past elections and will continue to do so in the future,\" he\u00a0wrote. \"I do not see the U.S. military as part of this process; this is the responsibility of Congress, the Supreme Court, and components of the executive branch.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bill McGurn of The Wall Street Journal discusses how Supreme Court changes could impact Roe v. Wade. President Trump signed an executive order Friday ordering the Health and Human Services Department to ensure that federally funded facilities provide life-saving medical care for infants who survive abortions. Trump announced the measure during an address to the National Catholic Prayer breakfast earlier this week, but was unclear on details. In the released order, the White House specifies that it will enforce the medical care requirement and prioritize funding for programs that either research improvements to life-saving care or train medical personnel to provide that type of treatment. \"Every infant born alive, no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, has the same dignity and the same rights as every other individual and is entitled to the same protections under federal law,\" the order reads. The measure was celebrated by pro-life activists, who have coalesced around\u00a0Trump in the lead-up to November. JIM DALY: PASSING OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG PUTS THIS ALL-IMPORTANT ISSUE AT CENTER OF 2020 CAMPAIGN The issue\u00a0featured prominently in Trump's political messaging after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam indicated in 2019\u00a0that doctors should be able to refuse life-saving care to infants who survive abortions.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we talk about third-trimester abortions ...\u00a0it\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable,\" he said. \u201cIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d Focusing on abortion will likely boost Trump's standing among social conservatives\u00a0as he prepares to nominate another Supreme Court justice. Outside of Northam's comments, recently released testimony from David Daleiden's civil trial\u00a0has revealed that Planned Parenthood saw at least one infant born after an abortion, and may have seen more. The order was intended to protect individuals like Gianna Jessen who claims to have survived a botched saline abortion. In a video posted this week, Jessen thanked Trump for his efforts. NARAL Pro-choice America responded to the initial announcement by accusing Trump of misinformation and using a term -- \"born alive\" -- that's \"not grounded in medical science,\" according to a news release.\u00a0\u201cIt is downright cruel and a slap in the face to the American public that President Trump is deploying dangerous disinformation in a power grab for the Supreme Court, not to mention using executive powers to impose his own extreme ideology when he can\u2019t jam through his agenda legislatively,\" NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said. TESTIMONY FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, TISSUE PROCURER SHEDS LIGHT ON BABIES BORN ALIVE, WITH BEATING HEARTS Earlier this year, House Democrats rejected a measure -- the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act\u00a0-- that would have applied penalties to doctors who refuse to provide life-saving care. While Democrats have argued existing law protects infants, that particular law has been touted as a way to ensure infants receive care. Jacqueline Ayers, a vice president at Planned Parenthood Action Fund, argued Trump was trying to solve a \"nonexistent\" problem.\u00a0\u201cHealth care providers already have an obligation to provide appropriate medical care,\" she said. Former President George W. Bush passed the Born Alive Infant Protection Act in his first term, clarifying that infants born at any stage deserve the same protection as anyone else. Trump's order applies that law and EMTALA, which mandates emergency medical care, as benchmarks for whether federally-funded programs are in compliance. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Despite these laws,\" the order says,\u00a0\"some hospitals refuse the required medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment or otherwise do not provide potentially life-saving medical treatment to extremely premature or disabled infants, even when parents plead for such treatment.\" \"Hospitals might refuse to provide treatment to extremely premature infants -- born alive before 24 weeks of gestation -- because they believe these infants may not survive, may have to live with long-term disabilities, or may have a quality-of-life deemed to be inadequate. \u00a0Active treatment of extremely premature infants has, however, been shown to improve their survival rates.\"",

            "article_content": "U.S. counterintelligence chief warns that Russia, China and Iran are trying to interfere in the 2020 elections; Retired four-star Army general Jack Keane weighs in on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019 Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe told Fox News that China poses \u201ca greater national security threat\u201d to the United States \u201cthan any other nation,\u201d detailing a web of\u00a0threats\u00a0that includes \u201celection influence and interference.\u201d Intelligence officials\u00a0say they are increasingly concerned about interference in the U.S. election by China, adding to existing concerns about meddling by Russia that have been around since 2016, as well as the threat of meddling from\u00a0Iran. INTEL COMMUNITY HAS DELIVERED NEARLY 20 CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS TO TRUMP, BIDEN, DNC, RNC, CONGRESS \u201cChina poses a greater national security threat to the U.S. than any other nation \u2013\u00a0economically, militarily and technologically. That includes threats of election influence and interference,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox News in a statement. While Russia was widely seen as favoring now-President Trump\u00a0and generally seeking to sow chaos in America during the 2016 election, the difference with China is it is\u00a0seen to be seeking a Trump loss in November.\u00a0Yet congressional Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who ever since 2016\u00a0have issued dire warnings about Russian meddling, have not been quite so vocal about China\u2019s potential to interfere in the 2020 election. Pelosi, D-Calif., last week\u00a0said the threats of interference from Russia and China are \u201cnot equivalent,\u201d while urging the intelligence community to put out more information about Russian efforts, saying Moscow is \u201cactively 24/7 interfering in our election.\u201d Ratcliffe said the threat from China is actually significant, and\u00a0he\u00a0is \u201ccommitting the IC resources needed to fully understand the threat posed by China and provide U.S. policymakers with the best intelligence to counter China\u2019s broad and deep malign activities.\u201d \u201cChina is concerned that President Trump\u2019s reelection would lead to a continuation of policies that they perceive to be \u2018anti-China,\u2019\u201d Ratcliffe explained, noting that the intelligence community has briefed \u201chundreds of members of Congress\u201d to raise their concerns about China \u201cand its increased efforts to impact the U.S. policy climate in its favor.\u201d \u201cFair and free elections are a bedrock of American democracy, and the IC remains vigilant against the various activities by China, as well as other threat countries and actors, which seek to affect our electoral process,\u201d Ratcliffe said. ODNI 'PRIMARILY CONCERNED' WITH CHINA, IRAN, RUSSIA 'SEEKING TO COMPROMISE'\u00a02020 ELECTION The intelligence community has acknowledged that Russia\u2019s meddling remains a threat in 2020, but specifically mentioned China\u2019s efforts, which an official within the intelligence community told Fox News has been ramping up in the last several months, citing rhetoric between the U.S. and China. China\u2019s cyber efforts, with relation to efforts to influence the election, are anti-Trump administration\u00a0and largely include fake social media accounts to amplify certain anti-American beliefs. According to a report released this month by Graphika, social media accounts from the pro-Chinese political spam network\u00a0Spamouflage Dragon\u00a0began posting English-language videos that attacked American policy and the Trump administration in June. The report revealed that some of the accounts made on YouTube and Twitter used artificial intelligence-generated profile pictures, which is a common technique in disinformation campaigns, and did not appear to receive any engagement from \u201cauthentic users\u201d across social media platforms. The efforts also did not appear to \u201cseriously attempt to conceal its Chinese origin as it pivoted toward messaging related to U.S. politics,\u201d the report stated. Specifically, the report revealed that some of the anti-Trump messaging is related to the coronavirus pandemic and racial justice protests across the U.S. A video titled \u201cWho is responsible for this national disaster in the United States?\u201d posted on July 12, called Trump a \u201cfirm and creative ally\u201d of the coronavirus, according to the report. The tone, according to Graphika, \u201cwavered between scathing criticism of the American government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and apparent sympathy for everyday American citizens exposed to the pandemic and the anti-racism protests.\u201d Meanwhile, as for the intelligence community\u2019s preparedness in the 2020 election versus 2016 to handle malign influence activities, an ODNI official told Fox News that the intelligence community is \u201csignificantly ahead of where it was in 2016 in terms of providing updates to the American people on election threats, including China.\u201d The ODNI official also told Fox News that the intelligence community supports the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI in their efforts to support state and local officials in protecting election infrastructure. The official also said that the ODNI is working with the FBI and its field office network to bring intelligence insights to state and local officials. Earlier this month, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center Bill Evanina, who is leading the intelligence community in election security, warned that rival nations once again are attempting to influence U.S. policy and elections in a variety of ways, declaring that Iran wants to \u201cundermine\u201d President Trump, while Russia is working to \u201cprimarily denigrate\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden. INTEL COMMUNITY SAYS IRAN SEEKING TO 'UNDERMINE' TRUMP, RUSSIA WORKING TO 'DENIGRATE' BIDEN IN NOVEMBER That election threat update also noted that China \u201cprefers\u201d that Trump \u201cdoes not win reelection\u201d in November. Evanina said earlier this month that Bejing prefers a Trump loss because Chinese officials view him as unpredictable, adding that China has been expanding its attempt to influence the general election and shape U.S. policy, by pressuring political figures Chinese officials\u00a0view as opposed to their country's\u00a0interests. \u201cAlthough China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action, its public rhetoric over the past few months has grown increasingly critical of the current administration\u2019s COVID-19 response, closure of China\u2019s Houston consulate, and actions on other issues,\u201d Evanina said earlier this month. China \u201chas harshly criticized the administration\u2019s statements and actions on Hong Kong, TikTok, the legal status of the South China Sea, and China\u2019s efforts to dominate the 5G market,\" Evanina said.\u00a0\"Beijing recognizes that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race.\u201d Last month, the Trump administration\u00a0moved to close the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas, partially because of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s targeting of U.S. energy firms. Later the same day, China\u00a0ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the western city of Chengdu in Sichuan Province, in apparent\u00a0retaliation. As for TikTok, the Trump administration has taken a tough stance on the Chinese social media platform, issuing an executive order this month that would see the platform banned in the U.S. within 45 days. The U.S. ban put pressure on the China-based company to sell the app\u2019s U.S. platform \u2013\u00a0Microsoft is reportedly a leading contender, but the deal will be closely monitored by the Trump administration. Evanina has delivered nearly\u00a020 classified briefings to both Trump and Biden\u2019s presidential campaigns, political committees and members of Congress \u2013 including members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees\u00a0and congressional leadership \u2013 on election threats since mid-May. An ODNI official told Fox News that the briefings are led by Evanina and his team, but said that FBI and the Department of Homeland Security officials and other agencies often are present. As for the FBI, Director Christopher Wray has been warning of Chinese efforts to influence U.S. opinion, and economic espionage, for months. Earlier this summer, Wray told Fox News that China \u201ccertainly\u201d has an interest \u201cin influencing our political thought\u201d and policies and is trying \u201cto shift them in a more friendly, pro-China, pro-Chinese Communist party direction.\u201d He\u00a0warned that those efforts sometimes get \u201cwrapped up in election issues.\u201d Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Schiff, D-Calif., has warned that China could be using different ways of influencing the election than Russia and Iran, telling NBC News that the Chinese could use trade negotiations with the U.S. But a spokesman for Schiff did not respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment on whether his committee would initiate an investigation into potential Chinese election interference, as the panel did with Russian election meddling efforts \u2013 an investigation that\u00a0stretched throughout the Trump administration. A GOP aide told Fox News that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, though, have had an investigation focused on China dating back to previous congressional sessions, noting that China is something \"we're very concerned about.\" \"We're looking at it and we've never stopped,\" the GOP aide told Fox News. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, said the Trump administration has been tough on Russia while claiming China and Iran oppose Trump because he's been tough with them too. \u201cWe don\u2019t need or want foreign interference, and President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square,\u201d Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. \"The intelligence community\u2019s assessment that both China and Iran are trying to stop President Trump\u2019s reelection is concerning, but clearly because he has held them accountable after years of coddling by politicians like Joe Biden.\u201d",

(Bethel Church) Johnson, explaining that he isn't trying to coerce anyone or tell them who to vote for, said he believes Trump \"is the only one who isn't owned by either party, and is fully capable through courage and boldness to bring about the changes needed.\" TRUMP, ONCE PRESBYTERIAN, NOW SAYS HE'S A 'NONDENOMINATIONAL CHRISTIAN' The church's silence in California, Johnson added, has allowed \"taxpayer-funded gender transition drugs and surgeries available to children ... that could undermine parental consent. This is insanity ... we must act.\" The charismatic pastor\u00a0said the excuse of \"I only have one vote and my vote doesn't really matter\" is a lie from the devil meant to silence millions of voices. BIDEN SAYS CATHOLIC FAITH GUIDES POLICIES BUT GETS HIT ON ABORTION, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Johnson said he will continue to pray for Trump and his family, as he did for former presidents Clinton, Bush\u00a0and Obama,\u00a0\"that he would have great wisdom for his near impossible assignment, and that he would always listen to godly counsel ... that he would increase in favor with God and man.\" He added:\u00a0\"I pray for those who are in fear or uncertainty leading up to this election, that God Himself would give them peace and a hope-filled promise. And finally I pray that each of us would have a life of realizing the fulfillment of dreams, with great health and blessing in every area of life.\" Trump, who recently announced\u00a0he no longer identifies as Presbyterian but as a non-denominational Christian,\u00a0carried the evangelical vote with 80 percent of support in 2016 and is expected to maintain that or have even greater support Nov. 3, according to recent polls.

President Trump took aim at critics in the mainstream media on Twitter Thursday after his suggestion of delaying the 2020 election sparked quick, widespread\u00a0backlash. \u201cGlad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I totally support!),\u201d Trump wrote in the first of a series of late afternoon tweets. \u201cMust know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!\u201d the president wrote in a follow-up tweet, adding that \u201cWe are going to WIN the 2020 Election, BIG!.\u201d Members of the media and politicians on both sides of the aisle had condemned the president\u2019s earlier suggestion that the U.S. could delay the upcoming election over security concerns about mail-in ballots. SWIFT BACKLASH AFTER TRUMP SUGGESTS DELAYING ELECTION \u201cWith Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,\u201d the president argued in an 8:46 a.m. tweet that was still pinned to the top of his profile early Thursday evening. \u201cIt will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201d In response, top lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum doled out soundbites opposing the move.

Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe defended his decision to\u00a0scale back in-person election security briefings to\u00a0Congress in favor of written reports and accused\u00a0members of Congress of leaking information \"within minutes\" of briefings. Ratcliffe told \"Sunday Morning Futures\" he had been going above and beyond in briefing \"not just the oversight committees but every member of Congress\" but will no longer do so.

They are a serious national security threat, but day in, day out, the threats that we face from China\u00a0are significantly greater,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Anyone who says otherwise\u00a0is just politicizing intelligence for their own narrative.\" On Friday, Ratcliffe told lawmakers\u00a0that\u00a0his office \u201cwill primarily meet its obligation to keep Congress fully and currently informed leading into the Presidential election through written finished intelligence products.\u201d He wrote that it would better protect sources and methods\u00a0while ensuring that it reflects \u201cthe highest analytic standards.\" REPUBLICAN REP INTRODUCES BILL TO KO UNEMPLOYMENT PERK FOR RIOTERS House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accused the Trump administration of pushing a false narrative to downplay Russian interference in the 2020 election. \"They're going to put it in writing now instead of giving an oral briefing. That doesn't make any sense unless the goal is not to allow members of Congress, the representatives of the American people, to ask questions,\" Schiff told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"Concealing the truth is concealing Russians are again intervening to help the president in his reelection,\" Schiff said.

The abortion measure, Amendment 1, was touted as a way to ensure state residents would clearly be on the record opposing the procedure in the event the Supreme Court was to overturn the\u00a0landmark Roe V. Wade decision. The question before voters Tuesday was whether to explicitly state that \u201ca right to abortion and the funding of abortion shall not be found in the Louisiana Constitution.\u201d APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS KENTUCKY ABORTION RESTRICTIONS The wording also made clear that Louisiana opposes public funding for abortions. Amendment 1 was backed by 62% of Louisiana voters with about two million votes cast, according to election data. Voters in Louisiana approved a constitutional amendment on Tuesday that clarified the document does not grant the right to an abortion in the state.\u00a0 (Max Becherer/The Advocate via AP) Three states have similar constitutional language: Tennessee, Alabama\u00a0and West Virginia.

But if the Supreme Court were to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion rights, the amendment would ensure against any court ruling that language in the Louisiana Constitution grants abortion rights.

More than 92\u00a0million Americans have already cast their ballots ahead of Election Day \u2013\u00a0but some might\u00a0be wondering if they can change that vote, according to Google Trends. Google searches of the phrase \"can I change my vote\" peaked Tuesday morning in the U.S. around\u00a06 a.m. ET. CLAWING BACK VOTES: 7 STATES ALLOW VOTERS TO RESUBMIT BALLOTS One of the subregions where the phrase began trending at one point was in Delaware, the state\u00a0Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden represented in the Senate for 36 years. Other subregions included battleground states such as Maine, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin and Arizona, according to Trend data at various points throughout Tuesday morning. USPS PUT TO THE TEST BY FOX NEWS AHEAD OF 2020 ELECTION While most states do not allow voters to change their early votes, there are some that do, with restrictions. For example,\u00a0in New York, if you\u00a0have submitted an absentee ballot but change your mind, you can show up to your polling place during early voting or on Election Day and cast a vote, in which case the absentee ballot is set aside and not counted, according to the state Board of Elections. Voting booths (iStock) In Michigan, voters sent in a ballot could\u00a0submit a written and signed request to their voting clerk by 5 p.m. Oct. 30 requesting to have the ballot nullified, according to the Detroit Free Press. Minnesotans who mailed in an absentee ballot had until Oct. 20 to request a new ballot from their county or city election office. FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY In New Hampshire, voters who submitted an absentee ballot can go to the polls on Election Day during the first hour they're open and vote in person, or before their absentee ballot is processed. In Wisconsin, if time allows, a voter could\u00a0cancel their original absentee ballot and request a new one \u2013\u00a0but they had\u00a0until Oct. 29, the legal deadline for requesting absentee ballots by mail. As of Sunday, the 92\u00a0million Americans who have voted early in the\u00a02020 presidential election\u00a0suggest a record turnout this year.

            "article_content": " Voters in 32 states are being asked to weigh the merits of more than 100 statewide ballot measures this Election Day\u00a0-- in addition to electing the next president and candidates vying in other races. These propositions fall into a wide range of categories from marijuana to abortion to gray wolves. Here\u2019s a few that are generating the most interest. Pot Ballot measures in four states \u2014 Arizona, Montana, New Jersey\u00a0and\u00a0South Dakota \u2014 could lead to the legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes. MARIJUANA-LEGALIZATION SUPPORTERS TOUT ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN NEW VOTER PITCH Similarly, in\u00a0Mississippi, voters are being asked to decide on competing ballot measures that could lead to the state approving marijuana for medical purposes. Race Nebraska and Utah voters are being asked to weigh in\u00a0on measures to scrap language in their state constitutions referencing slavery as a potential punishment for a crime. POLL SHOWS ARIZONANS SUPPORT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA The language is still there even though no one has been punished that way in a century. \"Slavery under no circumstances is a Nebraska value,\" said Melina Cohen, secretary of the group Vote for Eliminating Slavery. Mississippi voters will weigh a measure ratifying a new flag with the magnolia flower design, taking the place of the old Confederate battle standard that has been widely condemned as racist. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS ON GENDER LANGUAGE, TAXES FOR EDUCATION BEFORE UTAH VOTERS Rhode Island voters are considering a proposition removing the words \u201cProvidence Plantations\u201d from the state\u2019s official name. If approved, the state would change from the \"State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\" to the \"State of Rhode Island.\" App-based drivers from Uber and Lyft protest in a caravan in front of City Hall in Los Angeles on October 22, 2020 where elected leaders hold a conference urging voters to reject on the November 3 election, Proposition 22, that would classify app-based drivers as independent contractors and not employees or agents. (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Abortion The hot-button issue of abortion is before voters in two states: Louisiana and Colorado. In Colorado, a ballot measure asks voters to approve\u00a0a ban on abortions after 22 weeks. The only exception would be to save the life of the mother. Violations could lead to fines of up to $5,000 against doctors. Mothers would not face criminal penalties. Louisiana\u2019s proposal amends language in the state constitution making it clear that no such right to abortion is recognized. ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION DRIVING FLORIDA LATINO VOTERS TO THE POLLS Should states assume more authority to regulate abortion under a more solidly conservative U.S. Supreme Court, Louisiana state courts would have less ability to strike down anti-abortion laws, the Wall Street Journal reported. Taxes On the ballot in Illinois is a change to the state\u2019s constitution that would dump the state\u2019s flat-rate income tax structure in favor of graduated tax structure that takes a bigger bite from the wealthy. Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u00a0backs the change and has put up more than $56 million to convince voters to make the change. Billionaire Ken Griffin has donated most of the $50 million that has been raised to defeat it, according to reports. Economics A proposal is on the ballot in Florida\u00a0to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The measure would hike the current minimum wage of $8.56 an hour to $10 in 2021. It would then increase by $1 an each year until it reaches $15 by 2026. In California, the biggest fight is over Proposition 22. Uber, Lyft and Doordash are asking voters to support the ballot initiative that would define app-based drivers as independent contractors and not employees. But it would also require those companies to put in place policies providing \u201calternative benefits,\u201d including a guaranteed minimum wage and subsidies for health insurance if they average 25 hours of work a week. UBER, LYFT, VIA OFFERING ELECTION DAY RIDE-SHARING DISCOUNTS Supporters say drivers enjoy the independence and flexibility under the current model, according to the Associated Press. \u201cIf I want to work four hours and say, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 I can do that,\u201d said Doug Mead, a Palm Springs retiree who delivers meals for Uber Eats and Postmates and estimates he makes about $24 an hour. \u201cWhere is there an employer on the planet where I can do that?\u201d Colorado voters will weigh a ballot measure that would establish a paid family and medical leave program in the state. Employee contributions into the program would be matched by employers. State Democratic lawmakers have pushed to create a paid family leave program but opponents have questioned the cost to employers and workers. Voting Ballot measures in three states \u2014\u00a0Alabama,\u00a0Colorado\u00a0and\u00a0Florida\u00a0\u2014 ask voters to tweak language in their state constitutions to say that \"only a citizen of the United States\" is qualified to vote. The language doesn\u2019t change much. Federal law already prohibits most non-citizens from voting and, according to the Montgomery Advertiser in Alabama, no state has allowed general voting by non-citizens in 100 years. TAX HIKES ON NOVEMBER BALLOT IN MANY STATES AMID CORONAVIRUS ECONOMIC FALLOUT Florida has a proposition that if approved would change state elections to a \u201ctop two\u201d system, similar to California. Florida candidates for the state legislature, cabinet and governor would appear on the same primary ballot and then the top two candidates would move on to the general election. That could leave two Democrats or two Republicans facing each other in the general election. Gray\u00a0wolves Colorado voters will decide on an\u00a0initiative that would reintroduce gray wolves on designated lands west of the Continental Divide. Supporters say the measure offers an opportunity for the wolves to expand\u00a0southward into the heart of the Rocky Mountains. The issue is controversial\u00a0with some farmers and ranchers worried about livestock.

            "article_content": "Pro-life Democrat Kristen Day weighs in. Ahead of next week's convention, anti-abortion Democrats are lobbying their party to fix what they describe as an \"extreme\" deviation on the issue that could effectively surrender certain states to Republicans in November. \"We should not cede large swathes of the United States to the Republican Party,\" read a letter signed by Louisiana Gov. John\u00a0Bel Edwards and dozens of other Democratic politicians. The letter warns that the party's platform will alienate pro-life Democrats, and calls on the platform committee to reintroduce more moderate language from the party's 2000 platform. \"We support reintroducing the conscience language from 2000 into the 2020 platform, which acknowledges that Americans have differing and deeply held views on abortion,\" the group said.Included among the signatories was Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., who recently lost his primary to a Planned Parenthood-backed candidate. That race, and former Vice President Joe Biden's reversal on the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal dollars from being spent on abortions except in certain cases,\u00a0has been painted as a bellwether for the party's purportedly growing insularity on the issue. \"The Hyde amendment has been necessary in building a more equal society,\" DFL board member Terrisa Bukovinac told Fox News.\u00a0\"It has saved more than 2 million people who are disproportionately black, indigenous and children of color and we will not allow our party to pretend that eliminating this crucial safeguard is progress. We demand equality and we\u2019re not going to stand by and watch our Party allow this exploitation to continue simply because the industry is bankrolling their candidates political aspirations.\" FRANKLIN GRAHAM WARNS BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET 'SHOULD BE A GREAT CONCERN TO ALL CHRISTIANS' Earlier this year, the Daily Caller reported on how DemList, which typically builds an unofficial schedule for the convention, refused to include space for the \u201cpro-life caucus.\u00a0Day also told Fox News her group hasn't received a response to a letter it sent from more than 100 religious figures on the issue. It's unclear whether the individual signatories received their own responses. Regardless, DFL executive director Kristen Day said she'll hold a virtual caucus anyway, and expects \"hundreds\" to attend as they broadcast live from Milwaukee. \"We have people on the ground now that will be promoting the pro-life voice within the Democratic Party. We have had unprecedented growth and it is really exciting,\" she told Fox News. She speculated that Lipinski\u2019s loss in Illinois \u201clit a fire under people.\u201d A draft platform released by Politico showed the Democratic National Committee\u00a0supporting taxpayer-funded abortions as well as a codification of the landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade. According to Day, activists from throughout the country are expected to descend on the convention in protest of the party's advocacy. The demonstrations will be \"daily\" leading up to the convention on Monday, Bukovinac said. PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT LEANS INTO 2020 ELECTION TO BOOST TRUMP, CLAIMING ISSUE 'HAS GONE FROM LIABILITY TO ASSET' Day and others predict that Democrats' positions would allow abortion until\u00a0birth.\u00a0Liberals have continually framed the issue as one surrounding fundamental human rights and racial equity when it comes to taxpayer funding of abortion. Meanwhile, Black anti-abortion activists have clashed with Planned Parenthood over claims abortion is comparable to genocide for their community. Still, Planned Parenthood has maintained that their position is popular with voters. \"Poll after poll shows that voters want champions for reproductive health \u2014 including the right to access a safe and legal abortion \u2014 in public office,\" Planned Parenthood said in July. \"Politicians who want to take those rights away aren\u2019t just pursuing bad policy, but a losing political strategy.\" The Democratic National Convention did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. DEMOCRATS FACE INTRAPARTY RESISTANCE OVER HYDE AMENDMENT AS LEADERSHIP PURSUES REPEAL Polling indicates that both sides could face pushback at the ballot box. Voters tend to support some limits on abortion, but not the all-or-nothing approach often advanced by each side. In May, for example, Gallup found that 50 percent of voters thought abortion should be legal only under certain circumstances, as opposed to any (29 percent) or none (20 percent). That ranking of preferences reflected Gallup\u2019s historical data as well. And while a plurality say abortion is \u201cimmoral,\u201d moderates (55 percent) tend to identify as \"pro-choice.\" It's unclear how the platform will effect\u00a0turnout but Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., have embraced codifying Roe and a repeal of Hyde. After Lipinski's loss, Day indicated that anti-abortion Democrats might just sit out future elections. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to a June Gallup report, 24 percent Democrats consider themselves pro-life. And a Marist poll, conducted with the Knights of Columbus,\u00a0from January showed 44 percent of Democrats said they were \"more likely to vote for\" candidates who would limit abortion to the first trimester.",

            "article_content": "'Unfortunately, the Supreme Court, which is now essentially an arm of the Democratic Party, is now going to legislate and extend mail-in-voting count by three days,' says Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman. Less than a month before Election\u00a0Day, an unprecedented number of Americans have already cast their ballots, indicating a possible record turnout for the race between incumbent\u00a0President Trump\u00a0and Democratic rival\u00a0Joe Biden. More than 8 million Americans have voted in the election so far, almost 10 times the number who had done so by this point in 2016,\u00a0according to data released Friday\u00a0by\u00a0the United States Elections Project, which compiles early voting data. TRUMP AND BIDEN SUPPORTERS OUT IN FORCE ACROSS FLORIDA \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this many people voting so far ahead of an election,\u201d Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, who administers the project,\u00a0told Reuters. He noted the shift could be the result of states expanding early and mail-in voting -- a result of the coronavirus pandemic -- as well as an eagerness to weigh in on Trump's political future. More than 50 million people have requested mail-in ballots this year, the data shows. In 2016, some 57.2 million Americans voted early in person, by mail or via absentee ballot.\u00a0State election officials in several key swing\u00a0states have warned it could take days to count all of the votes. Trump has repeatedly claimed\u00a0that mail-in voting would allow for widespread fraud, but experts have said such fraud is rare. PRESIDENT TRUMP RELEASES UPDATE, SAYS HE'S FEELING 'MUCH BETTER' AFTER HOSPITALIZATION McDonald told Reuters he expects total voter turnout in the 2020 election to hit 150 million, or 65% of eligible voters. That would mark the highest\u00a0it has been in a general election since 1908. As of Friday, Democrats had returned more than 1.7\u00a0million ballots nationally, while Republicans had returned about 750,500,\u00a0according to Elections Project data. Florida so far has\u00a0the highest number of people who have already cast a ballot at 1.37 million, followed by Virginia at 886,962\u00a0and\u00a0Michigan at 844,344. All but about a half-dozen states allow some form\u00a0of early in-person voting. ABC NEWS ANNOUNCES BIDEN TOWN HALL ON OCT. 15 AFTER TRUMP PULLS OUT OF VIRTUAL DEBATE According to an aggregate of polls by Real Clear Politics, Biden is currently leading Trump nationally by 9.6 percentage points.

President Trump\u2019s support among Black and Hispanic voters in the 2020 election appears to have grown since 2016 -- even as he lost support among White voters, according to a Fox News Voter Analysis. Currently, with votes still being tallied, Trump has 8% support among Black voters, up from 6% in 2016. TRUMP CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCES THE LAUNCH OF NEW NATIONAL SPANISH-LANGUAGE AD 'POR TRUMP' Among Hispanics, he has 35% support, up from 28% in 2016. At the same,\u00a0support for the Democratic candidate is up among White voters. Biden has 43%\u00a0vs. Hillary Clinton\u2019s 39% in 2016.\u00a0That 4-point increase makes a bigger difference to the overall vote because White voters make up a much larger share of the electorate (74%) compared to Black (11%) and Hispanic (10%) voters. The analysis is based on surveys of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with voting results from the Associated Press. Those numbers could still change by a few percentage points in either direction, based on the final vote numbers. Trump\u2019s campaign had made significant efforts to tap into the Hispanic and Black votes. Trump had touted low pre-pandemic unemployment among both groups and had pointed to certain policies -- such as criminal justice reform\u00a0and\u00a0his \"Platinum plan\" to increase employment among Black Americans and support\u00a0Historically Black Colleges and Universities\u00a0-- that he believes would help him with Black voters in particular. Meanwhile, the campaign launched targeted ads in Spanish in an attempt at ginning up support among Hispanic voters.

            "article_content": "Helmut Norpoth called Trump's 2016 victory and predicts another White House win this year. Despite recent polls that identify\u00a0Joe Biden as the heavy favorite in\u00a02020, a political science professor is still standing by his\u00a0prediction model that shows President Trump having a \"91 percent\" chance of winning in November. Mediaite reported on Wednesday that\u00a0Stony Brook professor\u00a0Helmut Norpoth is doubling down on his \"Primary Model,\u201d which has correctly predicted five out of the past six elections since 1996 and every single election but two\u00a0in the past 108 years. \u201cThe Primary Model gives Trump a 91 percent chance of winning in November,\u201d Norpoth said. \"This model gets it right for 25 of the 27 elections since 1912, when primaries were introduced.\" As Mediaite noted, the two elections the model failed to predict were\u00a0the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy and the 2000 election of George W. Bush. NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST URGES BIDEN NOT TO DEBATE TRUMP UNLESS POTUS AGREES TO 'TWO CONDITIONS Norpoth's model examines the results of presidential primaries as the strongest indicator as to the outcome in the general election, not the polls that dominate the political discussion. According to Norpoth, Biden is in a much weaker position than Trump because of his poor showing in the first two primary races. Before making the stunning comeback in the South Carolina primary and carrying the following races, Biden came in fourth place in Iowa with just 15.8 percent of the vote and came in fifth place in New Hampshire with just 8.4 percent. Norpoth stressed that enthusiasm is key. \u201cThe terrain of presidential contests is littered with nominees who saw a poll lead in the spring turn to dust in the fall,\u201d Norpoth told Mediaite. \u201cThe list is long and discouraging for early frontrunners. Beginning with\u00a0Thomas Dewey\u00a0in 1948, it spans such notables as\u00a0Richard Nixon\u00a0in 1960,\u00a0Jimmy Carter\u00a0in 1980,\u00a0Michael Dukakis\u00a0in 1988,\u00a0George H.W. Bush\u00a0in 1992, and\u00a0John Kerry\u00a0in 2004, to cite just the most spectacular cases.\" Norpoth's model, which correctly predicted Trump's victory roughly\u00a0nine months before the 2016 election, suggests that the president will win\u00a0by even a wider margin in the electoral college with 362 electoral votes versus the 304 he earned against Hillary Clinton. Mediaite pointed out such a victory would nearly match Barack Obama's 2008 election, when\u00a0he earned 365 electoral votes. The Stony Brook professor appeared on \"The Ingraham Angle\" back in May making the same prediction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While the \"Primary Model\" hands Trump his reelection, national polls suggest Biden will win handily in November. The Real Clear Politics average shows the former VP besting the sitting president by 8.7 points. In the latest Fox News poll, Biden has a 12 point lead over Trump. The president's polling has taken quite the hit in recent months amid the coronavirus outbreak and increased racial tensions following the death of George Floyd.",

            "article_content": "Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum give you a sneak peek of tonight's final presidential debate, what to expect from each candidate, and more from around the nation. Republican pollster Frank Luntz told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier on Thursday night, that his \"profession is done\" if President Trump wins re-election come Nov. 3, and proves the national polls wrong yet again. \u201cI hate to acknowledge it, because that's my industry \u2014 at least partially \u2014 but the public will have no faith. No confidence. Right now, the biggest issue is the trust deficit,\u201d Luntz said in response to Baier asking how\u00a0pollsters will fare if they are wrong in predicting the 2020 presidential election. \u201cPollsters did not do a good job in 2016. So, if Donald Trump surprises people, if Joe Biden had a 5- or 6-point lead, my profession is done.\" National polls\u00a0largely show Biden with a lead over Trump with two weeks until the presidential election. Real Clear Politics, which pools together several national polls and takes the average, shows Biden up by 7.9 points, though in battleground states the former vice president is only up by 3.8 points \u2013 well within margin of error, which generally hovers around plus or minus four points. Hillary Clinton was projected to win in 2016, with polling consistently\u00a0similar to Biden\u2019s. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s election project gave Clinton an 86 percent chance of winning during this point in the last presidential race. Biden is currently projected to win with an 88 percent probability. Some polls appear to show a tighter race in their polling this time around. But Luntz, a GOP pollster, still thinks that Biden will win the presidency after claiming that Trump won the second and final presidential debate Thursday. \u201cYou've got to give Trump a minor victory because he\u2019ll bring some [undecided] voters home, and it\u2019ll close the race a little bit,\"\u00a0Luntz told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\" Friday.\u00a0\"But in the end, I think Joe Biden won the war.\u201d Clinton also faced obstacles that Biden is not necessarily struggling with. Clinton was running in the post-Obama administration era and reports after the 2016 upset showed that voters were intrigued by Trump\u2019s unusual, non-political behavior and ready for a shift in Washington. The other major factor that will come into play during the 2020 election is the number of voters who were disillusioned with the 2016 presidential race and opted not to vote at all. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Although more people are expected to vote early during the 2020 presidential election, opposed to waiting until Election Day to vote in-person, more than 38 percent of the number of votes cast in 2016 have already been recorded with two weeks remaining until the General Election, according to the U.S. Election Project. Democrats so far have cast their vote at a rate nearly double that of\u00a0Republicans, though as early polling stations are opening the ratio will likely start to even out.

GRAHAM ANNOUNCES $500G DONATION TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN LEGAL EFFORTS, CALLS PHILLY ELECTIONS 'CROOKED AS A SNAKE' Richard Hopkins, a mail carrier from Erie, Pa., accused his boss of fraud in the affidavit. AFFIDAVIT OF RICHARD HOPKINS by Fox News on Scribd \u201cAlthough, as I understand Pennsylvania law, ballots must be postmarked by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day, November 3, 2020 in Pennsylvania, Postmaster Rob Weisenbach directed my co-workers and I to pick up ballots after Election Day and provide them to him,\u201d he said. In addition, he alleged that he overheard Weisenbach tell another supervisor he was backdating the late ballots to make them appear as though they had been collected on Nov. 3 \u2013 \u201cdespite them in fact being collected on Nov. 4 and possible later.\u201d Weisenbach did not immediately respond to a Fox News request\u00a0for comment. David Partenheimer, a\u00a0spokesman for the Postal Service, said the agency first\u00a0learned of the allegations on Friday. \"They were immediately referred to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Office of Inspector General, and the matter remains under investigation,\u201d he said.

The Trump campaign and Republican groups have already filed a flurry of lawsuits in the state. A spokesman for the Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment on the mail carrier's allegations -- but on Twitter the former vice president has called for voters to \"stay calm\" amid controversy over slow ballot counting. \"The Process is working,\" he wrote Thursday, before becoming the projected 2020 presidential election winner. \"The count is being completed.\" Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Members of Congress usually have the upper hand when they run for re-election. But this past week, two\u00a0more House incumbents were ousted in contested primaries. That brings to seven\u00a0the number of sitting House members who\u2019ve been defeated\u00a0by primary challengers in the 2020 election cycle. While that\u2019s not a record, the list includes\u00a0some longtime veterans of Capitol Hill. ANOTHER LONGTIME HOUSE DEMOCRAT OUSTED BY PROGRESSIVE PRIMARY CHALLENGER The four\u00a0Republicans and three Democrats defeated in the primaries lost for different reasons. But there is some commonality. \u201cUsually someone takes their eye off the ball, loses touch with their constituents\u00a0or becomes seen as a denizen or creature of D.C. ... You can become really vulnerable really fast in a primary election,\u201d said\u00a0Republican strategist Colin Reed, a veteran of multiple Senate and House campaigns. Here\u2019s a quick look at the seven House incumbents who will be packing up at the end of the year. Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo. The 10-term congressman\u00a0was defending a seat that\u2019s been represented by his family for more than half a century. Clay\u00a0succeeded his father \u2013 the late Rep. William Clay Sr. \u2013 who held the St. Louis-area seat for more than 30 years and was one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. But he was edged out in Tuesday\u2019s primary by Cori Bush, a younger and more progressive activist who came up through the Black Lives Matter movement. (From left to right: Reps. Eliot Engel, Lacy Clay and Steve Watkins. (Getty/AP)) Clay \u2013 who topped Bush by 20 points two years ago \u2013 was defeated this time around by a narrow margin. Bush, a 44-year-old nurse and ordained minister,\u00a0says she got involved in politics in the wake of the 2014 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Her second bid to unseat Clay started grabbing momentum after the May death of George Floyd sparked national protests against police brutality against minorities and systemic racism. Also helping was the backing and support from some of the biggest names on the left \u2013 including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont Rep. Steve Watkins, R-Kan. As Clay was going down to defeat in Missouri, the first-term Watkins was ousted in Kansas. Weeks before Tuesday\u2019s primary, Watkins\u00a0was charged with three counts of voter fraud for using the address of a UPS store rather than his home when registering to vote. The incumbent\u00a0told voters he had made a simple mistake and argued that the charges were a political attack. But Republican primary voters evidently disagreed, favoring\u00a0GOP challenger Jake LaTurner, the state treasurer. Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. Engel \u2013 who\u2019s spent three decades in the House \u2013 is the longest-serving incumbent this cycle to lose. The powerful chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee was ousted by Jamaal Bowman, a former middle school principal and first-time candidate. Riding a wave of support from some of the biggest names on the left \u2013 including Sanders,\u00a0 Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York -- Bowman defeated Engel by double digits in the primary in a district that encompasses parts of the\u00a0Bronx and portions of neighboring Westchester County. The incumbent came under attack ahead of the primary for spending more time at his home in Potomac, Md., than at his apartment in the Bronx. And he was put on the defensive after he was captured on a live microphone suggesting that \u201cif I didn\u2019t have a primary, I wouldn\u2019t care\u201d about speaking at an event in his congressional district. Bowman, who is Black, started surging past Engel, who is White, during late May and early June amid nationwide protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death. Bowman\u2019s victory is being compared to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s blockbuster 2018 primary victory over longtime Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa The outspoken Republican had been stirring controversy for years\u00a0but kept getting re-elected by conservative constituents in his\u00a0northwest\u00a0Iowa district \u2013 until now. After making comments defending the term \"white nationalism,\" King lost the support of fellow House Republicans and was stripped of his seats on committees. That was enough for state Sen. Randy Feenstra to oust King in the GOP primary. Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill. Lipinski \u2013 who\u2019s served in Congress for a decade and a half \u2013 is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats on the Hill. He was defeated in his suburban Chicago district by Marie Newman,\u00a0a vocal supporter of abortion rights and\u00a0proponent of \"Medicare-for-all.\" Rep. Scott R. Tipton, R-Colo. Tipton \u2013 who has\u00a0represented his rural Colorado district for nearly a decade \u2013 was endorsed by President Trump. That\u2019s usually enough for a GOP\u00a0incumbent to ward off a primary challenger. But Tipton\u2019s challenger was ultra-conservative Lauren Boebert, a vocal gun rights activist who kept touting that she was keeping the doors open during the coronavirus pandemic to Shooters Grill, her weapons-themed restaurant. Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va. Like Tipton, the first-term Riggleman \u2013 who represents a rural district \u2013 had the backing of the president. But he was defeated by social conservative challenger Bob Good at the party convention. An apparent major reason for Riggleman\u2019s ouster:\u00a0Last year, he officiated the same-sex wedding of two campaign volunteers.",

Iowa Gov.\u00a0Kim Reynolds,\u00a0a Republican and\u00a0avid supporter of President Trump, is expected to speak at the Republican National Convention Tuesday night. The overall convention is themed \u201chonoring the great American story.\u201d Reynolds, who has been governor since 2017,\u00a0is expected to deliver remarks on the second night, themed \u201cLand of Opportunity,\u201d when speakers are planning to highlight Trump\u2019s policies on trade, abortion, and the opioid crisis. Iowa is traditionally a swing state, and Trump won in the 2016 presidential election with 51.1% of the vote. IOWA FARMERS DEVASTATED AFTER DERECHO DAMAGES 14 MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND, GRAIN BINS Though it\u2019s unclear what Reynolds will discuss, Iowa is grappling with the severe damage left earlier this month when a hurricane-strength 100 mph wind storm known as a \u201cderecho\u201d ripped through the Midwest. Even with some school buildings damaged, Reynolds, like Trump, has pushed for students to return to in-person instruction this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Trump visited Iowa and participated in a roundtable with local leaders in Cedar Rapids after the storm.\u00a0He approved a portion of Reynolds\u2019 request for funding under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Individual Assistance Program for Linn County. The president later approved additional aid for Benton, Boone, Cedar, Clinton, Dallas, Jasper, Johnson, Jones, Linn, Marshall, Polk, Poweshiek, Scott, Story and Tama Counties. The Aug. 10 derecho has left 14 million acres of farmland with corn and soybean crops damaged across the state, as well as some 60,000 homes destroyed. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds speaks during a news conference, Friday, Aug. 14, 2020, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\u00a0 The derecho left tens of thousands of residents of Iowans without power. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s swift and decisive response will deliver critical assistance for our state as we continue to recover from this devastating storm,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement\u00a0Thursday. \u201cWhile many in the national media ignored what was happening here on the ground following the devastating derecho, President Trump and I spoke the day after the storm hit. During that conversation, he promised the full cooperation of the federal government during this critical time. Once again, he has come through and I am grateful for this President\u2018s unwavering commitment to Iowa as we continue to secure federal assistance for all affected counties.\u201d Reynolds issued a mandate in July requiring school districts across the state to reopen with at least 50% classroom instruction. In her order, the governor said districts where 15% or more of coronavirus tests were positive over the prior 14 days can request permission to move to online instruction for two weeks at a time. That 15% threshold is three times higher than what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends, and the surgeon general has recommended a 10% limit. \u201cEducation is fundamental to the well-being of our children, and our teachers are essential to ensuring that our schoolkids return to learn rather than mark time and lose ground,\u201d the governor said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe can do this safely.\u201d The statewide teachers union announced a lawsuit last week challenging the governor's ability to make such decisions for local districts. The Iowa City school board, which like many others had planned to start the year fully online, voted to join the lawsuit. Meanwhile, earlier in the month, Reynolds and the Iowa Department of Education said $26.2 million would be available to districts, nonpublic schools, and colleges and universities primarily to increase Internet connectivity for students for the 2020-21 school year.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik) States and local districts have set widely varying thresholds for reopening schools, but Iowa's is among the highest anywhere. By contrast, New York City says schools can reopen if positivity rates are below 3%. Arizona has put its rate at 7%. Reynolds assumed the role of governor in May 2017 and won reelection in November 2018. Her current term ends on January 10, 2023. In addition to Reynolds, two of the president\u2019s children, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, are scheduled to speak at the RNC Tuesday night, as well as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer. Others speakers are anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson; Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce; Mary Ann Mendoza, an Arizona woman whose police officer son was killed in an accident caused by a man in the country illegally; and Nicholas Sandmann, a Kentucky teenager who gained attention last year for a widely shared video of his interaction with a Native American man, Nathan Phillips, during demonstrations in Washington, D.C., near the Lincoln Memorial.

            "article_content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Donald Trump lost. But Trumpism did not. It won in the parts of the country and with the voters whom Trump catered to over four years, constantly jabbing the hard edges of almost every contentious cultural issue into Red America, on the bet that fear and anger were a winning hand. It almost was. Joe Biden defeated Trump to win the presidency, and is on pace to win up to 306 electoral votes, a total that would match what Trump exaggerated as a \u201clandslide\u201d four years ago. In a typical election year, such a victory would mean Biden would have carried other Democrats along with him. Instead, several promising Democratic Senate and House candidates, including incumbents, lost. For Trump, the situation was the inverse. His popularity among his base voters helped protect incumbent Republicans but was not enough to save him. He won more votes for president than any other candidate. Except Biden. The rejection of Trump was personal. The election did little to suggest that the country was suddenly less polarized. Trump wrung out votes from areas where he already had a core of support, in rural and small-town America. Biden did the same, only more, in urban and suburban America while also holding down Trump margins in some rural areas. The outcome didn\u2019t change the fact that much of the country is still speaking two different political languages. TRUMP WOULD COMMIT TO PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER, KEEPS REFUTING RESULTS ON TWITTER \u201cThis defied everyone\u2019s expectations. Everyone said if Joe Biden wins, Democrats win the Senate. If Trump wins, Republicans win the Senate,\" said Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and chief of staff to President Barack Obama. \"That\u2019s not what happened. Clearly there was an undertow. A man waves a flag at a pro-Trump rally at the Pennsylvania state Capitol in Harrisburg, Pa., Friday, Nov. 5, 2020. (Associated Press) \u201cLife is not binary,\" Emanuel said. \"It\u2019s more complicated. Florida, a state that voted for Trump, voted for the minimum wage. Illinois, a state that voted for Biden, voted down a progressive income tax. California, cobalt blue, voted against affirmative action in the place of employment.\u201d Emanuel said that Democrats may have erred in not offering clearer plans about how they would rebuild the economy while also gaining control over the virus and in not batting back Republican efforts to label them socialists. \u201cTrump played to people\u2019s fatigue about COVID,\" he said. \"If we had brought the same sense of urgency to getting the economy moving as we did getting COVID under control, it might have been different.\u201d Instead, some Democrats were advocating for expanding the Supreme Court and ending the filibuster in the Senate, proposals that might have prompted fear about one-party control. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there was more voter frustration with Trump than with the ideology of the Republican Party,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a strategist to several Republican presidential campaigns who broke with his party over Trump. \u201cClearly the presidential race was operating in its own world from the congressional race.\u201d Since Trump campaigned largely on friendly turf, he also helped Republican candidates in those areas. \u201cTrump lifted Republican candidates by vastly boosting turnout in areas of Republican strength,\" said David Axelrod, former senior adviser Obama. \"In the states and districts that favor Republicans, they ran up the score.\u201d Hundreds of supporters of President Trump stage a defiant rally outside the New Mexico state Capitol building in Santa Fe, N.M., on Saturday, Nov. 7, 2020. (Associated Press) Many voters offered a consistent refrain about Trump: They liked his policies but could not abide his anger-fueled personality, his constant use of Twitter as a weapon, and the way he ridiculed anyone who dared disagree with him. Biden\u2019s call for a return to decency, and his appeal to be a president for all Americans and not just the base of his party, was an important part of his formula. But the closeness of the race, even with the president\u2019s persistently low approval ratings, was also a testament to the inherent power of an incumbent seeking reelection. There\u2019s a reason only three elected incumbents before Trump had lost in nearly a century. When an incumbent loses, the challenger\u2019s party often gains. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter, Republicans took 12 Senate seats from Democrats. In 1992, Bill Clinton\u2019s victory over President George H.W. Bush also came with three Democratic Senate victories over incumbent Republicans. When Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated President Herbert Hoover in 1932, Democrats gained nearly 100 House seats and a dozen in the Senate, giving Roosevelt the muscular majorities he needed to pass sweeping New Deal legislation. But no president in recent memory had maintained such iron-grip allegiance from his own party as Trump, with only a handful of Republicans in Congress ever willing to cross him, fearing that they were always one presidential tweet away from a primary challenge. They stuck with him during his impeachment, when only Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, voted to convict him, and Trump ostracized him. And several were sticking with him even in defeat, offering up unproven allegations of voter fraud. Some voters liked Trump's tough talk on trade and getting other nations to pay more for common defense. They gave him credit, right or wrong, for an economy that was buoyant before the pandemic struck. And Trump played to Americans\u2019 fatigue from all the restrictions imposed because of the virus by saying the warnings of his own administration\u2019s top public health officials were overblown. Still, there was a collective limit to how much more of Trump\u2019s always-in-your-face presidency they were willing to take. Not enough, though, to deliver Biden a majority in the Senate, at least not until the outcome of two runoff elections in Georgia in January. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But some Democrats also noted that they held most seats in swing states, and that Biden won in some competitive districts. \u201cThere are also many districts that Biden flipped from 2016, like my district,\" said Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia. She said her margin of victory over the same opponent more than doubled from 2018. \u201cThe bottom line on Republicans winning in traditionally Republican-held seats was their unprecedented turnout,\u201d Luria said. \u201cTrump was not able to capitalize on that turnout himself, because his actions and rhetoric over the last four years made him unpalatable to the majority of Americans.\u201d Biden clearly was seen as both a necessary and acceptable alternative. He had no pithy slogan like \u201cHope and Change\u201d when he was Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008. Rather, he tapped into a national desire to stop the noise, to turn the page from a period so marked by rage and hate inspired from the White House itself.",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pushed back against media outlets that have projected Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election, stating Sunday morning that \"this is a contested election\" that has not reached a conclusion. In an interview with Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Graham pointed to several allegations of possible fraud or error that could have altered the election's results. He\u00a0called on fellow Republicans to push back against the idea that Biden's victory\u00a0is a done deal, warning that if they do not, it will set a precedent that would be disastrous for their party. ROMNEY SAYS TRUMP SHOULD 'FOLLOW EVERY LEGAL OPTION HE HAS,' BUT CHOOSE WORDS 'CAREFULLY' \"If Republicans don\u2019t challenge and change the U.S. election system, there\u2019ll never be another Republican president elected again,\" Graham warned. \"President Trump should not concede, we\u2019re down to 10,000 votes in Georgia, he\u2019s going to win North Carolina, we\u2019ve gone from 93,000 votes to 20,000 votes in Arizona, where there are more votes to be counted. There are allegations of system failure, fraud.\" Graham also said that the election computer system in Michigan is suspicious, and told Republican Senate candidate John James not to concede. Like President Trump, James looked to be in a position to win on election night, only to have absentee ballots put his Democratic opponent ahead the following night. Graham delved into some of the allegations that have come up since election night. He said that\u00a0Trump\u2019s team canvassed early voters in Pennsylvania and found more than 100 people they believe were dead, with at least 15 Graham said who were confirmed dead. He also said Trump\u2019s camp found six instances in Pennsylvania where people were registered to vote after they died, and then votes were cast in their names. HOW THE REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE SAVED THEIR SENATE MAJORITY The senator also said that the FBI, the Postal Inspector, and the Senate Judiciary Committee will be looking into a postal worker in Erie, Pa., who claims that supervisors were backdating ballots that were being sent out so they would appear to have been sent on Election Day instead of after. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that goes,\u201d Graham said, before repeating his claim that there is evidence of dead people being registered to vote and having ballots in their names. \u201cSo to my Republican colleagues out there: We have to fight back or we will accept our fate. I want Pennsylvania to explain to the American people how six people after they die can register to vote in Pennsylvania. I want the computer system in Michigan that flipped votes from Republicans to Democrats to be looked at.\u201d Graham went on to say that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of shenanigans going on,\u201d and that President Trump should indeed fight in court. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Prior to the election, Trump and other Republicans had warned that large-scale mail-in voting would complicate the election and leave it exposed to risks of fraud. Graham on Sunday claimed that these concerns were well-founded. \"The post office is the new election center. It\u2019s the wild, wild west when it comes to mail-in balloting, everything we worried about has come true,\" he said. \"So if we don\u2019t fight back in\u00a02020 we\u2019re never going to win again presidentially.

Jack Keane on \u2018Fox News @ Night.\u2019 U.S. officials are cautioning that\u00a0China\u00a0has stepped up\u00a0election meddling\u00a0activities to alter the policy climate and counter condemnation of the Communist Party leadership still grappling with the fallout of the\u00a0coronavirus, which spawned from the country late last year to cripple almost every pocket of the planet. But how exactly does a government some 7,000 miles away meddle in the democratic process of arguably the world's most advanced country? \"China has been involved in election interference this cycle, both the presidential race and all the way down the ballot,\" Christopher Whyte, an assistant professor in the homeland security and emergency preparedness program at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Fox News. \"There are direct 'election hacking' efforts that attempt to either directly or indirectly target the vote, by hacking into polling locations, registration databases, etc. Then, there are broader influence efforts that are intended to shape the context of the election itself \u2013 the issues, the mindset of voters.\" Gualala, CA, July 4, 2020 - Person mailing United States absentee ballot for voting in an election by mail. Despite the uproar that rippled down during and after the 2016 election, which highlighted an array or Moscow-led misinformation campaigns,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0has again been thrust into the hot seat \u2013 albeit armed with a few more resources, personnel, and knowledge \u2013 to demur election tampering. VATICAN UNDER FIRE FOR MOVING TO RENEW DEAL WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY Last month, the tech giant announced that it had taken down hundreds of pages, postings, and accounts written in Chinese, English, and Filipino linked to a Chinese operation \u2013 but stopped short of pinning any blame directly on Beijing. Facebook said that the accounts were initially created several years ago and centered on altering perceptions of Chinese activity in the South China Sea, before taking a more U.S political turn last year. Moreover, some lawmakers this election cycle have also called\u00a0into question\u00a0the role non-profit foundations and charities have in being misused as a conduit for peddling and prying. Namely, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.,\u00a0 wrote to top government officials last week requesting\u00a0an investigation into how the CCP officials use\u00a0nonpartisan American groups to push out Beijing's message and control narratives for those operating in their country. While the broad consensus among professionals is that Beijing favors a Joe Biden victory given President Donald Trump's rhetoric and trade crackdown against Xi Jinping's government, Whyte underscored that foreign powers ultimately aim to interfere so as to secure national interests. \"The Chinese effort has combined some digital interference with more conventional forms of influence \u2013 dark money, message-crafting, and propaganda \u2013 to steer discourse and policy away from hot button issues for the CCP,\" he continued. \"This has meant astroturfing \u2013 the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization \u2013 conversations about Hong Kong so as to avoid visible outbursts of support. It has involved attempting to recast discussion of COVID-19 as Chinese in origins to fit the Party narrative.\" Oct. 4: President Donald J. Trump participates in a phone call with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. (WHITE HOUSE) U.S. intelligence officials have also warned that the country is capable of far more sophisticated mechanisms than social media \u2013 pointing to modalities such as content farms, commentator brigades, and fake media personas to sway public opinion. Just weeks ago, Microsoft also sounded the alarm with a report highlighting Chinese activity focused on information persuasion and on raw intelligence collection from the Biden campaign and American think tanks. U.S. authorities typically view this as an \"opposition research\" effort to deepen their anti-Trump objectives. \"Americans think of election interference through the lens of influence, with China being anti-Trump and Russia being pro-Trump, but state-sponsored hackers like China are equally focused on intelligence gathering,\" Eric Noonan, CEO of CyberSheath, pointed out. \"This work includes the harvesting of log-in credentials and coordinated phishing campaigns targeting politicians and politically connected individuals within or adjacent to the U.S.\" \"Chinese hackers have been active online, but their operations to date appear to be more targeted at intelligence gathering, espionage and suppression of activists and critics, rather than more direct 'election interference' per se,\" Karim Hijazi, CEO of Prevailion, said. \"The Chinese have traditionally been focused on cyber espionage. When it comes to our election, the Chinese are more likely to seek out ways of stealing information in order to better understand the policies, practices, and strategy of the next administration. Microsoft specifically identified the China-based group Zirconium as being behind the operation, warning the country \"already poses a high cyber-espionage threat to the Homeland and Beijing's cyber-attack capabilities will grow.\" \"We've detected thousands of attacks from Zirconium between March 2020 and September 2020, resulting in nearly 150 compromises. Its targets have included individuals in two categories. First, the group is targeting people closely associated with U.S. presidential campaigns and candidates,\" Microsoft stated. \"The group has also targeted at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump administration. Second, the group is targeting prominent individuals in the international affairs community.\" The Florida state flag hands behind Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden as he speaks at Southwest Focal Point Community Center in, Pembroke Pines, Fla., Tuesday Oct. 13, 2020. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) The company noted that such targets have been \"academics in international affairs from more than 15 universities, and accounts tied to 18 international affairs and policy organizations, including the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center.\" \"Zirconium is using what is referred to as web bugs, or web beacons, tied to a domain they purchased and populated with content. The actor then sends the associated URL in either email text or an attachment to a targeted account,\" Microsoft explained. \"Although the domain itself may not have malicious content, the web bug allows Zirconium to check if a user attempted to access the site. For nation-state actors, this is a simple way to perform reconnaissance on targeted accounts to determine if the account is valid or the user is active.\" But according to some analysts, this is hardly the first time that Beijing has moved into the meddling melee. \"Years before the advent of Facebook and Twitter, Beijing initiated a well-resourced and multi-pronged campaign to positively influence public and political opinion about China and to neutralize potential threats to the regime's carefully crafted international image,\" noted Craig Singleton, an Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD). \"Such efforts began with relatively benign person-to-person exchanges and the cultivation of discreet relationships with influential U.S. business executives and decision-makers, including up and coming politicians.\" He said that in the intervening years, these efforts have expanded to include disinformation operations, coercion, threats of retaliation, clandestine operations, and the weaponization of the West's regulatory, legal, and lobbying loopholes. Dean Cheng, senior research fellow and China analyst at The Heritage Foundation, also brought to light a more subtle means of maneuvering one's mind. \"It would appear that at least some of the influence being employed is fairly typical -- targeting purchases of goods for states that are potential battlegrounds, or avoiding purchases from those same states,\" he said. \"In the Chinese system, it is difficult to state whether something is explicitly government-sanctioned.\" And just as the private sector has poured billions into boosting efforts to counter malign election interference from far away, U.S. government and intelligence agencies have also devoted excess resources to stay ahead of the threat. Students attend a ceremony to kick off the new semester in Wuhan High School in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020. (Chinatopix Via AP) In its first-ever \"Homeland Threat Assessment\"\u00a0report\u00a0unveiled publicly last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security cautioned of intrusion by China, as well as Russia and Iran. In terms of the former, the warning signals pivoted around Beijing's bid to disseminate falsehoods pertaining to the Chinese handling of the coronavirus, along with fraudulent virus text kits and protective gear. TRUMP CAMPAIGN CLAIMS DOUBLE STANDARD, POINTS TO BIDEN USE OF FAUCI COMMENTS From the perspective of U.S. Attorney-General William Barr, China has been the most assertive and aggressive in election intrusion. \"I believe it's China,\" Barr said in a CNN interview last month. \"Because I've seen the intelligence, that's what I've concluded.\" In August, the U.S. State Department took a\u00a0bold step\u00a0in designating the Confucius Institute U.S. Center, a Beijing cultural wing set up on various U.S. college campuses, as a Chinese \"foreign mission\" that plays a pivotal part in the country's \"multifaceted propaganda efforts.\" David Kennedy, a former hacker for the U.S. National Security Agency and now CEO of TrustedSec, and co-founder and CTO of Binary Defense, stressed that the U.S. has attempted to shore up the security around election systems and that additional funding was approved in December 2019 for $425 million towards election security, but it was hardly enough to redesign the overall systems. \"What is needed is more of a standardized approach to voting systems and one that is designed to withstand attacks from highly skilled and trained adversaries,\" he conjectured. \"China is one of the most alarming adversaries out there because they focus on extreme long-term strategies aimed at bolstering China's influence around the world. They are one of the most advanced cyber warfare capable nations, and they focus on anything they can do to promote China first.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nonetheless, analysts also emphasize that the impact of election obstruction is challenging to aptly gauge, and understanding its consequence on the vote may never be fully understood or measured. \"The biggest risk we face from the Chinese is information warfare,\" Hijazi added. \"Since their hackers focus on cyber espionage, it is possible they could dump some of this stolen information on the web, in order to try and hurt Donald Trump's campaign.\"",

The left heavily relies on the Supreme Court and the precedent it sets to enact their agenda -- especially in 2020, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said Monday evening. Appearing on \"Fox News @Night\" with host Shannon Bream, Hume explained that jurisprudence on abortion in the history of the highest court ahead of\u00a0Monday's ruling on a controversial Louisiana abortion law is a \"horrible mess.\" SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LOUISIANA LAW ON ABORTION CLINIC RESTRICTIONS The court decided that the law -- which requires that\u00a0individuals who perform\u00a0abortions\u00a0at clinics have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital -- is unconstitutional, as it places an undue burden on women seeking abortions. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts arrives at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2020. President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0impeachment trial\u00a0quickly burst into a partisan fight Tuesday as proceedings began unfolding at the Capitol. Democrats objected strongly to rules proposed by the Republican leader for compressed arguments and a speedy trial. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) The court ruled 5-4 with Chief Justice John Roberts once again casting a deciding vote by siding with his liberal counterparts. Hume pointed to two previous rulings, including one on sexual preference and another on the\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, where \"Roberts voted like a man who was afraid to see the court weighing in\" on\u00a0controversial political issues. Bream asked Hume whether this would be a \"top issue\" for voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election in November. Hume replied that he was not sure it has ever not been a top issue. \"Because what we've had for many decades now is a time in which the left could only get part of its agenda enacted by the legislature of Congress and the state legislatures,\" he said. \"It has turned to the court and -- often with success -- managed to get enshrined in our constitutional law matters that could not possibly have passed Congress or the state legislatures.\" \"And, they've been depending on it for years,\" added Hume. \"The left recognizes very much how important the court is to that effort.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"John Roberts and other conservatives on the court were supposed to stand to thwart the kind of imaginative, expansive readings of the Constitution which would create new rights that had not been imagined by the framers,\" he told Bream. \"But, that's what the left has wanted, sought, and often gotten in recent decades,\" Brume said. \"And that is one reason why the left is so determined to get a Democrat into the White House -- so that the effort to stall that will not succeed.\"",

            "article_content": "Louisiana Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond questions Attorney General Bill Barr during House Judiciary Committee hearing. Attorney General William Barr appears to disagree with President Trump over whether November\u2019s general election will be rigged. Responding to a line of questioning from Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La.,\u00a0Tuesday as he testified in front of the\u00a0House Judiciary Committee, Barr contradicted the president by saying \u201cI have no reason to think\u201d the 2020 election will be \u201crigged.\u201d GROUP QUIETLY PLANS FOR WHAT HAPPENS IF BIDEN-TRUMP RESULTS ARE CONTESTED The president the past few months repeatedly railed against the dramatic increase in balloting by mail during the primaries amid serious health concerns over in-person voting amid the coronavirus. \"Mail-in voting is horrible. It's corrupt,\" the president argued during a White House press briefing in early April. Trump suggested that \u201cyou get thousands and thousands of people sitting in someone's living room signing ballots all over the place\u2026I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing.\u201d Last month, he claimed in a tweet that \u201cBecause of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history.\u201d And on Sunday, the president took to Twitter\u00a0to charge that \u201cThe 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place, & everyone knows it.\u201d The president has rarely offered specific evidence to back up his claim that voting by mail is rampant with fraud and abuse. The charges by the president are his latest claims -- disputed by critics and opponents --\u00a0regarding voter fraud, which he insists kept him from winning the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. While Trump crushed Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College vote to win the White House, the Democratic nominee topped Trump by nearly 3 million votes in the national popular count. TRUMP SAYS SURGE IN VOTING BY MAIL HIS 'BIGGEST RISK' For months, the president has railed against efforts by Democrats and some Republicans to allow more people to vote by mail in the general election due to coronavirus health concerns. His reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee earlier this year launched a multimillion-dollar legal push to squash moves by Democrats to expand ballot access. Democrats, pushing back against the claims by Trump and the GOP,\u00a0say that cases of actual voter fraud are limited and claim that Republicans are trying to suppress voter turnout to improve their chances of winning elections. Barr, in his testimony, agreed with Trump as he argued that \u201cwholesale\u201d mail-in voting \u201csubstantially increases the risk of fraud.\u201d Election\u00a0experts do say that voting by mail is more susceptible to fraud than casting a ballot in person, but they\u2019ve seen no evidence of widespread fraud or that absentee balloting favors Democrats. But the massive increase in absentee balloting places an extra burden on already stressed-out state and county election officials and on a U.S. Postal Service facing financial and manpower deficits. Asked what he would do if the president loses the election, the attorney general answered that \"if the results are clear, I would leave office.\u201d WHAT TRUMP TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT ACCEPTING THE ELECTION RESULTS In an interview a week and a half ago on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d the president declined to commit to accepting the election results in November. \u201cI have to see. ... No, I\u2019m not going to just say yes. I\u2019m not going to say no, and I didn\u2019t last time, either,\u201d Trump said\u00a0when pressed during his sit-down interview with host Chris Wallace. The comment went viral,\u00a0sparking scores of headlines and stories theorizing what might happen if the president loses November\u2019s general election\u00a0but won\u2019t accept the results and concede.",

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden called Arizona \u201can important city\u201d during an interview on the 2020 election.

            "article_content": "Tom Bevan, RealClearPolitics co-founder, and Jim Messina, former WH deputy chief of staff, weigh in on 'The Daily Briefing.' On Election eve, President Trump\u00a0faces challenging poll numbers but remains confident of pulling off a second straight come-from-behind victory. \u201cWe're going to win four more great years in the White House,\u201d Trump predicted as he spoke to supporters in Georgia on Sunday night. The latest national public opinion polls\u00a0appear to tell a different story. But it's a much closer contest in the key battleground states that will decide the White House winner. WHAT THE FINAL FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL SHOWS IN THE BIDEN-TRUMP SHOWDOWN An NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll conducted Thursday through Saturday indicated\u00a0Democratic presidential nominee\u00a0Joe Biden holding a 10-point (52%-46%) lead over Trump while a Quinnpiac University poll conducted Wednesday through Sunday showed Biden up by 11-points (50%-39%). But a survey conducted for Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD/TIPP) pointed to a three-point (49%-46%) advantage for the former vice president over Trump, with third-party candidates grabbing 3%. A Fox News National poll conducted last week showed the president trailing Biden by eight points, 52%-44%. An average of all final polls on the eve of the election compiled by Real Clear Politics puts Biden up 6.8 points over the president. The margins are slightly narrowing. Biden was up 8.9 points over the president in the Real Clear Politics average two weeks ago, and ahead by 7.8 points a week ago. A Rasmussen Reports daily tracking poll showed 52 percent of likely voters approving of Trump's performance as president, with 48 percent disapproving. The current national polling deficit for Trump is bigger than the one he faced against former Secretary of State\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0at this time in the presidential election four years ago. On the eve of the 2016 election, Clinton held a 3.2-point advantage over Trump, according to an average compiled by Real Clear Politics. Clinton ended up winning the national popular vote by two\u00a0points. WHAT THE FINAL FOX NEWS BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION But it's the states and their electoral votes that decide who wins the White House -- and thanks to victories in six key battleground states that he flipped from blue to red, Trump trounced Clinton in the Electoral College vote to win the White House. Fast-forward four years and Biden has a slight edge in many of the key battlegrounds, according to an average of the final public opinion surveys in the swing states. But Biden's edge in some of the biggest battlegrounds has narrowed in recent days. The president and top Trump re-election campaign officials have repeatedly dismised most public opinion surveys, saying their own internal polls show a different story. Trump campaign senior adviser David Bossie told 'Fox and Friends' on Monday morning that the public surveys \"didn't capture the hidden Trump voter.\" And he predicted that \"we are going to see our people come out in droves.\" Here's a look at where the final polls stand in the key battleground states where the presidential election will be won. Pennsylvania Of all of the battlegrounds, Pennsylvania may be the most crucial \u2013 and is getting the most candidate traffic in the final stretch. \u201cPennsylvanians who haven\u2019t voted yet \u2013 we need every one of you to vote,\u201d Biden implored at a drive-in car rally in Philadelphia Sunday night. \u201cPennsylvania is critical to this election.\u201d Four years ago, Trump became the first Republican nominee to win Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump carried the state -- and its 20 electoral votes. An average of the final surveys on election eve indicated Clinton with 2.1-point edge over Trump, but he outperformed the polls, winning in the Keystone State by seven-tenths of 1%. Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a drive-in rally at Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, Sunday, Nov. 1, 2020, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) This time, the Biden campaign has heavily concentrated on Pennsylvania, the former vice president\u2019s native state. During his nearly four decades in the Senate representing Delaware, Biden was known as Pennsylvania\u2019s third senator. An average of the final surveys indicates Biden with a 2.9-point edge over the president. Trump campaigned in the Keystone State on Saturday and returns Monday. Besides the former vice president\u2019s events in the state on Sunday, Biden, running mate Sen. Kamala Harris\u00a0and their spouses are fanning out across the state all day on the eve of the election. Florida With 29 electoral votes up for grabs, Florida is the largest of the traditional battlegrounds. Twenty years ago\u00a0it was the state that decided the presidential election between then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. President Bush won the state by five points in his 2004 reelection. Barack Obama carried the state by razor-thin margins in 2008 and 2012. But four years ago, Trump narrowly edged\u00a0Clinton by 1.2 points to flip the state from blue to red. An average of the final polls in the state shows Biden with a razor-thin, 1.4-point edge over the president. President Donald Trump dances as he walks off stage after speaking during a campaign rally at Miami-Opa-locka Executive Airport, Monday, Nov. 2, 2020, in Opa-locka, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Biden and Trump held dueling rallies in the Sunshine State on Thursday. And Trump returned for a large, late-night rally on Sunday. Biden\u2019s most popular surrogate \u2013 former President Obama \u2013 closes out his campaigning in Miami on Monday. Many political analysts and pundits say that Florida\u2019s a must-win state for the president. Biden told his supporters in the state that \u201cyou hold the key. If Florida goes blue, it\u2019s over.\u201d Wisconsin Like Pennsylvania, Trump in 2016 broke the Democrats' quarter-century winning streak in Wisconsin\u00a0with a narrow victory over Clinton. An average of the final polls indicated Clinton ahead by 6.5 points, but Trump carried the state by seven-tenths of a percent. Fast forward to today, and as is the case in Pennsylvania, Trump is underperforming with key constituencies in the Badger State, including suburban voters. Also working against the president is\u00a0a new wave of coronavirus, which has hit Wisconsin particularly hard. An average of the most recent polls in Wisconsin gives\u00a0Biden a 6.6-point advantage in the battle for the state\u2019s 10 electoral votes. Clinton famously didn\u2019t set foot in Wisconsin in the general election. Biden made sure he didn\u2019t make the same mistake, repeatedly campaigning in the state. So has Trump, and the president returns to Wisconsin on the eve of the election. Michigan Democrats carried\u00a0Michigan\u00a0for a quarter-century in presidential elections until Trump narrowly won the state four years ago. Clinton was up in an average of the final polls by 3.6 points, but Trump won the state by three-tenths of 1%. But the president's support among White, working-class voters doesn't appear to be matching the 2016 levels, and Black turnout, which was down four years ago, appears to be reenergized. An average of the final public opinion polls\u00a0gives Biden a 5.1-point lead\u00a0in the battle for the state's 16 electoral votes. Biden teamed up with Obama\u00a0for two stops in Michigan on Saturday. The night before the election in 2016, Trump's final campaign\u00a0rally went past midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich.\u00a0Hoping to\u00a0repeat history, the president\u2019s once gain making Grand Rapids his stop in the 2020 campaign. Arizona Arizona has long backed Republicans in presidential elections. Bill Clinton in 1996 became\u00a0the only Democrat to win the state since 1952. But Trump carried the state by just 3 points four years ago. As with Florida, the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be doing him no favors with the state\u2019s crucial senior voters. An average of the final polls shows\u00a0Biden with a razor-thin, .9-point edge over Trump in the fight for the state\u2019s 11 electoral votes. North Carolina North Carolina\u00a0has seen plenty of candidate traffic in recent weeks, and its airwaves are being flooded with ads. Obama carried the state in 2008 by a razor-thin margin over Republican John McCain. Four years later, GOP nominee Mitt Romney won the state\u2019s 15 electoral votes by roughly 2 percentage points over Obama. Polls on the eve of the 2016 presidential election indicated Trump held\u00a0a 0.8-point\u00a0edge over Hillary Clinton. Trump ended up winning the state by 3.6 points. On the eve of this election, an average of the polls compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates Trump with a 0.6-point edge over Biden. The president makes North Carolina his first campaign stop on Monday. Ohio Biden called a last-minute audible and added a trip to Cleveland on Monday, making Ohio his first top on election eve. An average of the final polls in the Buckeye State indicates Trump with a 1.4-point edge over Biden. Ohio\u00a0has long played a crucial role in presidential elections. It was the state that famously put President George W. Bush over the top in 2004 for a second term. Obama narrowly carried the state in 2008 and 2012. Four years ago, it appeared it would be another close contest, with an average of the polls on the eve of the election putting\u00a0Trump narrowly ahead. But Trump ended up swamping Clinton by eight\u00a0points, flipping the state and winning Ohio\u2019s 18 electoral votes. Trump's margin of victory was the largest by any presidential candidate in nearly three decades. In the 2020 race, Ohio was\u00a0expected to remain\u00a0solidly Republican. But the race has tightened amid the pandemic and both campaigns heavily invested in the state in the closing weeks. Iowa Obama carried\u00a0Iowa\u00a0by 6 points in\u00a02012, but Trump flipped the Hawkeye State four years ago, topping Clinton by 9\u00a0points\u00a0even though the final surveys suggested a much closer margin. As with Ohio, it wasn't on the battleground radar a year ago. But Iowa's very much in the spotlight now, with an average of the final polls\u00a0in the state showing Trump with a 1.4-point edge over Biden. Georgia Southerner Bill Clinton in 1992 was the last Democrat to carry\u00a0Georgia in a presidential election. Long a red state, Georgia tightened in the 2016 election when Trump captured the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes by just 5\u00a0points. The president, apparently playing some defense, recently campaigned in the state and returned\u00a0on Sunday. Biden made his first general election trip to the state earlier this week. An average of the final polls indicates Trump with a 0.2-point edge. Nevada President George W. Bush in 2004 was the last GOP standard-bearer to win Nevada.\u00a0But Clinton narrowly edged Trump by 2 points four years ago, and Trump\u2019s eyeing to flip the Silver State. Both campaigns have invested time, money and resources in the state in the battle for its six\u00a0electoral votes. An average of the final surveys in the state indicates Biden with a 3.6-point advantage over the president. Minnesota President Richard Nixon was the last Republican to win the state \u2013 during his 1972 landslide reelection. Four years ago, Trump narrowly lost Minnesota\u00a0and its 10 electoral votes to Clinton, and for over a year the president and his reelection campaign have been eyeing the state in hopes of breaking the GOP's losing streak. An average of the final polls in the state gives Biden a 4.3-point advantage over Trump, but the surveys suggest that Trump has gained ground over the past month. The presidential nominees held dueling rallies in Minnesota on Friday. Texas It\u2019s been nearly a half-century since a Democrat won\u00a0Texas in a\u00a0presidential election: former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in 1976. But the longtime ruby-red state has become more competitive in recent years. Trump won Texas and its whopping 38 electoral votes by 9\u00a0points in the 2016 election, down from\u00a0Romney's 16-point win over Obama\u00a0in 2012. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Cook Political Report, a leading nonpartisan handicapper, last week changed its rating of the state from lean Republican to toss-up. An average of the final polls gives Trump a 1.2-point edge over Biden. In a sign\u00a0that the Democrats think Texas is in play, Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris made three stops in the Lone Star State on Friday.",

            "article_content": "Trump 2020 senior adviser joins 'Bill Hemmer Reports' to break down voter demographics President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden discussed\u00a0many important issues during their first presidential debate on September 29, but some of the most important ones weren\u2019t even mentioned. The words \u201cabortion,\u201d \u201cguns,\u201d \u201cmarriage,\u201d \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d weren\u2019t uttered at all. Which was odd, because these are the issues that animate millions of voters. And as I traveled the country for three years reporting for my book, \u201cOn the Road in Trump\u2019s America: A Journey Into the Heart of a Divided Nation,\u201d I learned that Democrats are increasingly seen as being out of step with residents of rural and industrial America because of their positions on these cultural issues. One day last fall, I listened as the chairman of the Democratic Party of Erie County, Pennsylvania, explained why his county had voted for Donald Trump in 2016 after twice supporting Barack Obama for president. DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP VS. BIDEN \u2013 VOTERS IN 2020 SHOULD THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT POLICY, NOT PERSONALITY He said that many blue-collar and rural residents there had voted for Trump because \u201cthey\u2019re caught up in what I like to call the \u2018non-issues.\u2019\u201d I asked him what those \u201cnon-issues\u201d were. \u201cThe guns and the abortion thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavily Catholic area.\u201d \u201cBut are those really\u00a0non-issues?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey\u2019re important to those people.\u201d \u201cWell not for those folks they\u2019re not non-issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI call them \u2018non-issues\u2019 because it\u2019s not health care, it\u2019s not the economy. It\u2019s not the things that we really need to be talking about right now.\u201d The chairman\u2019s casual dismissal of issues such as guns and abortion spoke volumes and highlighted a trend. In Macomb County, Michigan, former Obama voter Catherine Bolder explained that the Democrats\u2019 embrace of late-term abortion and race-based identity politics pushed her to support Trump. \u201cI was always pro-choice,\u201d she said when I interviewed her in 2018. \u201cI still am. But with New York and Virginia approving them to abort babies after they\u2019ve been born \u2014 look, if you carry a child for nine months and only then decide you don\u2019t want it \u2026\u201d she said, trailing off then shaking her head in exasperation. \u201c[The Democrats] have become radical on a lot of issues.\u201d In Howard County, Iowa, Joe Wacha told me his swing from Obama to Trump had been prompted by the Democrats\u2019 leftward drift on cultural issues. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t vote as a Democrat, and I am a registered Democrat, was I felt like they\u2019re no longer the party they were thirty years ago,\u201d he told me. Today\u2019s Republican Party \u201cis more like the way the Democratic Party was thirty or forty years ago,\u201d Wacha, who is in his early sixties, added. In Robeson County, North Carolina, a plurality of voters are members of the Lumbee Native American Tribe. Their overwhelming support for Trump in 2016 proved crucial to his winning the county and state. Trade was an important factor. One researcher estimated that Robeson County lost as many as 10,000 jobs due to NAFTA \u2014 more than any other rural county in America. So, Trump\u2019s abject hostility toward NAFTA made him an attractive candidate. But in talking to scores of people throughout the county, it was clear that social issues mattered most. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Jarrod Lowery said Republicans\u2019 social conservatism and emphasis on law and order resonate with the Lumbee, whose values focus on faith, family, and traditional mores. \u201cWhen the Democratic Party in America took that hard left on social issues, Lumbee people started backing up,\u201d he explained. I met with Virgil Lowery and McDuffie Cummings, Lumbee elders who I was told had a better sense for local politics than just about anyone in the area. \u201cThe Democrat party is too left for the grassroots people,\u201d said Cummings. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone with all these liberal ideas.\u201d \u201cYou saw it with [Joe]\u00a0Biden,\u201d Virgil added. \u201cHe used to be a moderate on abortion. Now he\u2019s moved all the way to the left with AOC\u2026. We have a lot of conservative people in this county as far as their morals on homosexuality.\u201d Even Channing Jones, executive director for the Robeson County Office of Economic Development, emphasized the supremacy of social issues. When I met with him in late January, he told me Robeson\u2019s economic indicators were \u201ctremendous\u201d and called the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the NAFTA replacement that Trump signed into law on the very day we met, \u201ca great thing\u201d for his county. Even so, he said that Trump\u2019s positions on \u201csome very significant moral issues, faith-based issues\u201d would be the most important factors working in the president\u2019s favor. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re in the Bible Belt down here,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be hard for many people to not think about that when they go to the polls.\u201d Each of the counties mentioned above twice voted for Obama before turning to Trump. Based on my research in these counties and others like them, Democrats will have a hard time winning them back this year. That\u2019s because around the time of Obama\u2019s election as president, the Democratic Party began to embrace positions that only a couple of years earlier had been regarded as extreme, even among Democrats. Once-fringe positions \u2013 including race-based reparations for slavery, decriminalization of illegal border crossings, government confiscation of certain types of guns and defunding of police departments \u2013 have suddenly become not only mainstream but almost mandatory for any candidate running for high office in the Democratic Party. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And previously acceptable positions \u2013 opposition to same-sex marriage, any restrictions on abortion and support for even modest enforcement of immigration law, for example \u2013 are now verboten for any Democrat aspiring to lead the party. \u201cThose kind of issues stirs the folks in this area and causes them all to vote and vote against the Democrats,\u201d Cummings explained. \u201cThe Democrats are just\u2026they\u2019re out of sync.\u201d This op-ed is adapted from \u201cOn the Road in Trump\u2019s America: A Journey Into the Heart of a Divided Country\u201d\u00a0(Republic Book Publishers, October 20, 2020).",

            "article_content": " By a 5-4 vote, a fractured Supreme Court\u00a0Monday\u00a0struck down Louisiana\u2019s effort to regulate abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals.\u00a0Chief Justice John Roberts agreed with four liberal justices that the state law imposed a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. While the decision guarantees that abortion will continue to roil our politics, it may prove an even more important signal of Roberts\u2019 determination to foil President Trump\u2019s agenda to remake the federal courts. June Medical Services v. Russo displays Roberts in fine form as a legal gymnast.\u00a0Four years ago, in Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, the chief justice had voted to\u00a0uphold\u00a0an identical law from Texas.\u00a0He lost that case, however, because Justice Anthony Kennedy joined with the court\u2019s liberal wing \u2013 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 to find that the burdens on abortion access outweighed the purported benefits of the regulation. MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: SUPREME COURT ABORTION CASE\u00a0\u2013 WHY COMING ELECTION SO CRUCIAL TO PRO-LIFE-CAUSE With President Trump\u2019s 2018 appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Kennedy, conservatives could have justifiably expected the court to finally discard the substantial burden test, first introduced in 1992 in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Trump\u2019s appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017 would not have had that effect, because he replaced Justice Antonin Scalia, a fierce foe of Roe. But Trump\u2019s supporters, many of whom voted for him in order to shift the court in a more conservative direction, would have believed that Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment would lead to\u00a0Roe\u2019s\u00a0end. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Those hopes came to a crashing halt Monday. While he refused to join the liberal justices\u2019 opinion in\u00a0Russo, Roberts voted to strike down the Louisiana law anyway in the interests of adhering to past precedent. \u201cThe legal doctrine of\u202fstare decisis\u202frequires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike,\u201d Roberts wrote in his concurrence. \u201cThe Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana\u2019s law cannot stand under our precedents.\u201d Roberts still claimed that he remained true to his legal principle.\u00a0He continues to \u201cbelieve that the [Texas] case was wrongly decided.\u201d But he said the question was whether to \u201cadhere to it in the present case.\u201d Conservatives on the court legitimately questioned Roberts\u2019 commitment to the Constitution. In a powerful dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas declared that the court\u2019s claim of\u00a0stare decisis\u00a0\u201cdoes not comport with our judicial duty under Article III, which requires us to faithfully interpret the Constitution.\u201d Instead, he wrote, \u201cwhen our prior decisions clearly conflict with the text of the Constitution, we are required to privilege the text over our own precedents.\u201d Because\u00a0\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0are based on a \u201cdemonstrably erroneous interpretation of the Constitution,\u201d Thomas concluded, \u201cwe should not apply them here.\u201d It is the court's job to uphold the Constitution, not its old\u00a0cases.\u00a0If its precedents conflict with the Constitution, it must reverse them, just as it refuses to enforce executive orders or statutes that violate the Constitution. Roberts has now frustrated President Trump\u2019s efforts to remake the federal courts. Why would Roberts vote to strike down a law that he believed, only four years ago, was constitutional?\u00a0His claim to\u00a0stare decisis\u00a0proves unconvincing.\u00a0If Roberts were right, the court should never have decided Brown v. Board of Education, which declared segregation unconstitutional, since\u00a0it\u00a0overruled Plessy v. Ferguson.\u00a0Roberts himself voted just last year to overrule precedents related to the Takings Clause and two years ago against mandatory union dues. Politics may well explain Roberts\u2019 rush to the pro-abortion side of the court.\u00a0He has now frustrated President Trump\u2019s efforts to remake the federal courts. Consider his votes just this term.\u00a0Roberts has stopped the effort to overrule Roe and Casey Monday.\u00a0Last week, in Regents of California,\u00a0he provided the fifth vote to block Trump\u2019s order ending the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Children and Deferred Action for Parents programs \u2013 even though the courts had held the orders unconstitutional. Two weeks ago, in\u00a0Bostock v. Clayton County, he voted to extend federal anti-discrimination protections in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to gay and transgender employees. Trump has set records in the speed and number of his appointments to the lower\u00a0courts, and\u00a0has chosen conservative nominees unmatched by any previous president in their sterling qualifications and intellect.\u00a0He has appointed two Supreme Court justices who have generally voted with stalwart conservatives Thomas and Samuel Alito.\u00a0But it has come to naught with Roberts shifting into the middle, swing position once occupied by Justice Kennedy. Roberts\u2019 supporters will argue that the chief justice is keeping the court out of politics during an election year.\u00a0In today\u2019s decision on abortion, he has planted the court in a very popular decision; polls suggest that Americans support a right to abortion but with reasonable limits.\u00a0He has achieved the same moderation with this month\u2019s immigration and gay rights cases, whose outcomes match the preferences of many. Roberts may tell himself that by restraining the conservatives on the court and moderating its course, he has removed the Supreme Court as a target for a possible Biden presidency. But Roberts\u2019 mistake is to play politics at all.\u00a0If he seeks moderation, he will respond to the political environment, which will only encourage more political efforts to pressure him and the court. The chief justice tried something like this back in 2012, when states challenged\u00a0ObamaCare\u00a0as exceeding the powers of the federal government.\u00a0After the oral argument, Democratic elected politicians launched unprecedented political attacks on Roberts and the court. According to reports, Roberts flipped his vote to uphold\u00a0ObamaCare, and in so doing upheld a popular program, but at the price of diluting the Constitution\u2019s careful limits on the balance between Washington, D.C., and the states. Today\u2019s legal gymnastics may have a similar purpose behind them.\u00a0But they are a loser\u2019s game. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By trying to keep the court in a low-profile, moderate position, Roberts forgets that advancing popular programs remains the job of the president and Congress, whom the people elect for that purpose.\u00a0The court\u2019s role should remain that of enforcing the Constitution\u00a0against\u00a0popular wishes \u2013 otherwise, we could dispense with a Constitution and just let elections decide all. By revealing his political concerns, Roberts will only further spur the politicization of the court, the political campaigns to influence the justices, and the circus that has become our confirmation process. By trying to protect the court in the short term, Roberts may well harm it in the long. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOHN YOO",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Well-known pastor and Christian author John Piper received\u00a0a range of responses after he published a \u201clong-overdue\u201d op-ed explaining why he won\u2019t vote for either Democratic nominee\u00a0Joe Biden or President Trump on Nov. 3. Evangelist Franklin Graham\u00a0is among Piper's critics, saying he disagreed\u00a0with his reasoning and pointed to a response in the Christian Post by former Planned Parenthood employee Abby Johnson, who spoke at the RNC. \"He is wrong on this issue,\" the son of the Rev. Billy Graham wrote on Twitter. Piper, the \u201cDesiring God\u201d founder and pastor emeritus of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, isn't making\u00a0a third-party endorsement like Kanye West nor does he \u201cdictate how anyone else should vote,\u201d but he does take clear shots at Trump, saying the last five years \"bear vivid witness\" to the \"nation-corrupting\" infection of \"flagrant boastfulness, vulgarity, immorality and factiousness\" spreading to every level of society.\" TRUMP, ONCE PRESBYTERIAN, NOW SAYS HE'S A 'NONDENOMINATIONAL CHRISTIAN' Piper wrote he is \u201cbaffled\u201d over the fact that many Christians consider the sins of unrepentant sexual immorality, boastfulness, vulgarity, factiousness, and the like, to be \u201conly toxic for our nation,\u201d while policies that endorse \u201cbaby-killing, sex-switching, freedom-limiting, and socialistic overreach are viewed as deadly.\u201d He cautioned that when a leader models \u201cself-absorbed, self-exalting boastfulness, he models the most deadly behavior in the world\u201d and \u201cpoints his nation to destruction. Destruction of more kinds than we can imagine.\u201d Piper said the \u201cchurch is paying dearly\u201d for communicating \u201ca falsehood to unbelievers (who are also baffled!) when we act as if policies and laws that protect life and freedom are more precious than being a certain kind of person\u201d year after year. Piper claimed his calling to lead people to Christ \u201cis contradicted by supporting either pathway to cultural corruption and eternal ruin.\u201d CHRISTIAN WOMAN NO LONGER BANNED FROM PARK FOR SHARING HER FAITH Johnson, the former Planned Parenthood employee, called Piper\u2019s comments \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cPride doesn\u2019t kill babies. Boastfulness doesn\u2019t tear them apart in their mothers\u2019 wombs. Arrogance doesn\u2019t cause a baby to flee for their lives as sharp instruments seek to rip them limb from limb while they are still alive. No. Abortion does that and abortion alone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe can\u2019t legislate pride or boastfulness or arrogance. But we can legislate abortion,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cIn fact, we can make it illegal. And that is what is on the line. Life is on the line. The innocent lives of precious babies are on the line. Not pride. Not arrogance.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Christians Against Trumpism, a campaign started by former 2016 independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin's group Stand Up Republic, used Piper's name on its website, running anti-Trump ads. \"I did not sign and would not sign 'Christians Against Trumpism & Political Extremism.'\u00a0My name is being used without my permission. I do not endorse any of the organizations listed here,\" Piper tweeted Friday. On the website, one group listed is Pro-Life Evangelicals for Biden.",

Navarro leveled the accusation Wednesday in the driveway of the White House. When asked by a reporter\u00a0for proof of the accusation, he replied: \"It's obvious.\" TRUMP SAYS MEDIA, NBA ARE \u2018BOUGHT OUT\u2019 BY CHINA: 'IT'S A BIG POT OF GOLD' \"What I think is happening here is the Democrat\u00a0Party and the Chinese Communist Party have entered into a common cause to defeat Donald J. Trump and their whole strategy is based on blaming this administration for a global\u00a0pandemic created by the Chinese Communist Party,\"\u00a0said Navarro, the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro speaks with reporters at the White House, Wednesday, July 29, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) He blasted Democrats for faulting Trump for the coronavirus pandemic and\u00a0failing to blame China during the Democratic National Convention. The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 172,000 Americans and the subsequent recession has forced about 56 million Americans to file unemployment claims. DEMOCRATS FORMALLY NOMINATE JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT IN VIRTUAL ROLL CALL The Trump administration has\u00a0recently taken an aggressive stance with China, from\u00a0closing the\u00a0Houston Chinese consulate to threatening to ban the popular Chinese-owned app\u00a0TikTok.\u00a0Navarro said if Democrat Joe Biden wins the presidency in November, he'd\u00a0\"turn\" the U.S. over to the Chinese Communist Party and the American people should be \"fearful.\" \"If\u00a0the Biden folks are able to win in November, they're basically going to turn this country over to the Chinese Communist Party,\" Navarro said. \"That's the takeaway.\" During an interview earlier this month with NPR's Up First, Biden said he would reevaluate the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese imports and he criticized Trump's unilateral approach to countering China's rising influence. \u201cWe\u2019re going after China in the wrong way,\u201d Biden said. \u201cChina is stealing intellectual property. China is conditioning being able to do business in China based on whether or not you have 51% Chinese ownership. That\u2019s got to end.\" \u201cThe way China will respond is when we gather the rest of the world ... That\u2019s when things begin to change. That\u2019s when China\u2019s behavior is going to change,\" he added. Throughout the convention, Democrats have accused Trump of downplaying the COVID-19 threat, peddling misinformation to the American people and failing to quickly enact national policies that would have kept Americans healthy. TRUMP\u2019S \u2018IT IS WHAT IT IS\u2019 IN DEM CONVENTION CROSSHAIRS, AS BIDEN CLAIMS NOMINATION One of the more blistering attacks\u00a0came from\u00a0Kristin Urquiza, who said her father died from COVID-19 after believing Trump that the virus was under control and would disappear. \"My dad was a healthy 65-year-old,\" Urquiza said on the first night of the DNC. \"His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.\"",

            "article_content": "Outside the convention center Trump supporters force Biden supporters to listen to Trump speeches. The Trump campaign held a Sunday afternoon press conference outside the Clark County Elections Department in Las Vegas to denounce alleged irregularities in last week\u2019s election. Among its speakers was former Attorney General Adam Laxalt and American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp. A supporter of President Donald Trump holds her hand over her heart during a protest of the election outside of the Clark County Election Department, Sunday, Nov. 8, 2020, in North Las Vegas.\u00a0 (AP) Laxalt attacked the state\u2019s signature verification process as being insufficient at protecting against supposed fraud, pointing out that Trump\u2019s campaign could not observe the authenticity of some 600,000 votes that have been counted in Nevada through the mailing system. \u201cThis campaign has not observed, has not laid our eyes \u2026 on an envelope\u00a0signature, and a voter roll signature, on a single one of those 600,000 voters,\u201d Laxalt said to audible boos in the audiences. Laxalt further criticized the Clark County Registrar\u2019s use of a signature verification machine called the \u201cAgilis system.\u201d GRAHAM: IF GOP DOESN'T FIGHT, THERE WILL 'NEVER BE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT ELECTED AGAIN' \u201cAt least 200,000 voters were counted through the signature verification process of this machine only,\u201d Laxalt said. \u201cI will repeat for the media: No human beings looked at those signature matches to confirm they were, in fact, matches. Schlapp claimed that there were instances of underage voters, dead people, and at least 9,000 non-Nevadans who voted in Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cWe know that underage voters voted in this most recent election. How difficult would it have been to make it clear that nobody would have been mailed a ballot if they had a birth date after a certain year?\u201d Schalpp asked. He said that more than 100,000 people have left amid an economic shutdown, \u201cyet through our due diligence, we\u2019ve able to find that at least 9,000 of them voted in this election. Non-Nevadans voted in Nevada.\u201d FRANK LUNTZ URGES POLLSTERS TO SEEK NEW PROFESSION AFTER TRUMP OUTPERFORMS POLLS: 'SELL REAL ESTATE' Both Laxalt and Schlapp stopped short of calling for specific legal action, but said they will continue to review their options and put forth all evidence of wrong-doing that they find. A Clark County official who wished to remain anonymous told Fox News that Laxalt\u2019s claims about the Agilis machine were \u201csuccessfully refuted\u201d in a recent lawsuit in which a judge upheld the legality of the county using it. Laxalt and Schlapp\u2019s appearance comes after a U.S. federal court judge on Friday denied an emergency motion from Nevada Republicans seeking to change the signature verification process used in the state. Supporters of President Donald Trump pray as they protest the election outside of the Clark County Election Department, Sunday, Nov. 8, 2020, in North Las Vegas.\u00a0 (AP) U.S. District Court for\u00a0Nevada\u00a0Judge Andrew Gordon said that the relief sought by two Republican candidates in Clark County would delay vote counting. \u201cI don\u2019t find plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThe public interest is not in disrupting the counting of the ballots.\u201d The Trump campaign sued in Nevada to stop the counting of what they called \u201cillegal votes,\u201d claiming to have evidence that people who are deceased and nonresidents have cast ballots in the 2020 election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump campaign alleges there are \"tens of thousands\" of people who voted in Nevada who are no longer state residents. The campaign said it is not seeking to stop the vote\u00a0but rather\u00a0ensure that\u00a0every \u201clegal\u201c vote is counted\u00a0and that no \u201cillegal\u201d votes are counted.

            "article_content": "President Trump says the federal courts need to step in to prevent mail-in ballots or we'll never know who won the election President Trump on Thursday blamed Democrats\u2019 push for funding for universal mail-in ballots as one of the reasons for a delay in negotiations on Capitol Hill over a fourth coronavirus stimulus package, claiming the practice in the 2020 election would cause \"the greatest fraud in history.\" During an exclusive interview with FOX\u00a0Business'\u00a0Maria Bartiromo on Thursday morning, the president said negotiations over the fourth economic stimulus relief package were held up, in part, due to Democrats'\u00a0demands for billions of dollars in funding toward mail-in voting. TRUMP WARNS OF MAIL-IN VOTING 'DISASTER' \"It's their fault,\"\u00a0Trump said. \"They want $3.5 billion for something that's fraudulent ... for the mail-in votes, universal mail-in ballots. They want $25 billion for the post office. They need that money so it can work and they can take these millions and millions of ballots.\" Trump added: \"But if they don't get those two items, then they can't have mail-in ballots.\" The president went on to slam the practice, saying that ballots have been \u201csent to dogs\u201d and \"dead people,\"\u00a0citing states like Virginia, where he said more than \u201c500,000 phony ballot applications were sent to voters,\u201d and in New York, where mail-in voting caused a weekslong delay in announcing results for some races in the state's primary. \u201cHow would you like to have $3.5 billion for mail-in voting? You know how much money that is? They want $25 billion for the post office because the post office is going to have to go to town to get these ridiculous ballots in,\u201d Trump said. The president went on to say that \u201cthere is nothing wrong with getting out and voting\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThey voted in World War I and in World War II,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey should have voter ID because Democrats scammed the system.\u201d He added, shifting back to negotiations on Capitol Hill, \u201cIf we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they won\u2019t get the money and they won\u2019t have universal mail-in voting.\u201d REPUBLICANS WARN MAIL-IN-VOTING RHETORIC COULD BACKFIRE The president went on to cite California, where he said the state is sending out \u201ctens of millions of ballots.\u201d \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll go to everyone but Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re challenging it in court. It\u2019s being challenged at many different levels.\u201d He added: \u201cThis will be the greatest fraud in history \u2014 this will be almost as fraudulent as Obama spying on my campaign.\u201d The president and the Republican Party have been warning\u00a0for months about possible\u00a0fraud connected to mail-in voting. The RNC and the Trump campaign\u00a0have filed lawsuits to hit back against efforts by Democrats to overhaul voting laws in response to the pandemic. Democrats, pushing back against the claims by Trump and the GOP,\u00a0say that cases of actual voter fraud are limited and claim that Republicans are trying to suppress voter turnout to improve their chances of winning elections. Meanwhile, the president went on to further slam Democrats, like freshman progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who he predicted would eventually challenge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and said she would win. The president, though, slammed her as a \u201cpoor student,\u201d saying she \u201cyaps\u201d but said that Schumer \u201cwill be heated by her.\u201d \u201cAOC will run against Chuck Schumer for the Senate and I think she\u2019ll win.\u201d The president then said the \"progressive Democrats are beating the regular Democrats.\" 75% OF AMERICANS CAN VOTE BY MAIL THIS YEAR, REPORT SAYS \u201cLook at Eliot Engel!

Trump in 2020, as votes are still being counted, has received the votes of more than 67 million Americans. He got approximately 63 million votes in 2016.

The RNC on Tuesday will launch television ads in a number of key states, including Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. TRUMP PREDICTS ELECTION DAY VICTORY The buy comes on the heels of the RNC committing to spend $60 million on digital efforts to get out the vote in the final stretch of the campaign. An RNC official told Fox News that roughly $14 million of the $25 million total will be spent on advertising targeted to seniors, with a focus on protecting Medicare. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s health care plan would be an inevitable step toward single-payer health care, leading to higher taxes, less quality of care, and a complete upheaval of our health care system,\u201d RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News. \u201cAs part of the RNC\u2019s multi-pronged effort to target and turn out voters, we will be telling the truth about Biden\u2019s socialized health care plan while aggressively highlighting how President Trump has improved Medicare and lowered premiums,\u201d McDaniel continued. \u201cThese ads will drive that message home in the final days.\u201d An RNC official told Fox News that Democrats are intent on making health care a top issue in the 2020 race, and that these new ads \u201cwill serve as an important reminder of the contrast that exists between President Trump and Joe Biden on health care plans.\u201d The official told Fox News that the ads will cast Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s health care plan as one that would \u201clead to single payer health care,\u201d and could \u201cjeopardize access to quality care, especially for seniors.\u201d The ads will also highlight that the Biden plan would \u201cgive taxpayer-funded health care to illegal immigrants.\u201d An RNC official touted the president's health care record, saying that\u00a0he lowered Medicare Advantage premiums by \"34% nationwide--the lowest level in 14 years.\" One ad, which will begin running in Michigan Tuesday, addresses senior citizens, and touts Medicare under President Trump. \u201cAttention fellow seniors: This election will determine your medicare benefits,\u201d a narrator says in the ad. \u201cUnder President Trump, Medicare premiums in Michigan have gone down 53%. But with the Biden-Harris health care plan, Medicare will change.\u201d The ad warns that \u201cprivate insurance\u201d would be \u201celiminated,\u201d and hospitals would close. \u201cYou could even lose your doctor,\u201d the ad says. \u201cProtect your Medicare coverage. Vote for President Trump.\u201d The ad then directs viewers to a website called \u201cSeniors Beware\u201d to learn more about the differences between Trump and Biden\u2019s health care plans. Former Vice President Biden\u2019s health care plan is aimed at protecting and building upon the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system \u201cless complex to navigate.\u201d Biden\u2019s health care platform vows to give every American access to \u201caffordable health insurance,\u201d as well as a \u201cpublic health insurance option,\u201d and aims to expand coverage to low-income Americans by offering premium-free access to a public option for individuals who would be eligible for Medicaid. The RNC buy comes as part of a joint effort with the Trump campaign, totaling $55 million on paid advertising in the final two weeks. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien called it a \u201cheavy buy,\u201d and added that they are \u201cconfident as ever\u201d in their \u201cpathway to victory.\u201d \u201cWe very much like where we\u2019re at,\u201d Stepien said Monday. \u201cWe have more than sufficient air cover almost, almost three times as much as in 2016.\u201d He added: \u201cThe goal of this is to ensure that we\u2019re supporting our ground troops, and they certainly have the air cover they need to bring this campaign to a successful close.\u201d The Trump campaign ads\u00a0will run in the key battleground states of Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada,\u00a0Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio.

            "article_content": "Senators question Amy Coney Barrett on her stance on the Affordable Care Act. In her calm and carefully controlled appearance, Amy Coney Barrett allowed herself only a hint of emotion. It was merely a hint, because she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a flat midwestern cadence, wrapping her answers in the gauzy tissue of court precedents and judicial process. But when Chairman Lindsey Graham asked about the nomination's impact on her family, the judge said: \u201cWe knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked. And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it, because what sane person would go through that if there wasn\u2019t a benefit on the other side?\u201d BARRETT SAYS SHE KNEW 'FAITH WOULD BE CARICATURED,' 'FAMILY WOULD BE ATTACKED' IF NOMINATED TO SUPREME COURT And that was self-evident, given how insane the court confirmations have become. Just ask Brett Kavanaugh. Barrett also had a touching moment as she described crying with her adopted Haitian daughter over the George Floyd video. Of course, Democrats are outraged that the hearings are taking place at all, given that the Republicans wouldn\u2019t hold one on Merrick Garland four years ago and are now ramming through President Trump\u2019s pick on the eve of the election. In walking into this hothouse environment, Barrett displayed perhaps the most important tool for a witness being grilled: discipline. She repeatedly returned to her legal mantra: Justices can\u2019t just decide to overturn laws at will, they have to wait for cases to reach them, they must respect precedent, they must consult with clerks and colleagues, and--this was her mantra--I have no agenda.  Perhaps the day\u2019s biggest news is that Barrett refused to recuse herself on a post-election challenge by the president who chose her (while saying she won\u2019t be \u201cused as a pawn\u201d).\u00a0She also declined to recuse on ObamaCare, whose constitutionality the Trump administration is challenging before the court. Her stance: there\u2019s a process for weighing recusal, and she will follow the rules.\u00a0The judge, who had written that John Roberts went too far in upholding ObamaCare, later insisted she is \u201cnot on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat, spoke passionately about abortion rights, but couldn\u2019t get the witness to commit to anything. DEMS WARN BARRETT CONFIRMATION MEANS DOOM FOR OBAMACARE, BUT 'SEVERABILITY' DOCTRINE MIGHT SAVE IT During that exchange, when the senator invoked Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s confirmation testimony, Barrett quoted Obama appointee Elena Kagan as saying she shouldn\u2019t give a \u201cthumbs up or thumbs down\u201d on legal questions that could come before the court. The judge also attempted to dismiss her branding as a \u201cfemale Scalia,\u201d although Antonin Scalia was her mentor, when asked about his legal opinions that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. She said she would be her own person. Questioned by Democrat Dick Durbin about whether she is pro-life, Barrett said she had signed a newspaper ad while coming out of church 14 years ago that \u201csimply said we support the right to life from conception to natural death.\u201d She told Democrat Richard Blumenthal she\u2019d forgotten signing a 2013 newspaper ad criticizing Roe and calling \u201cfor the unborn to be protected in law.\u201d The one answer that surprised me was Barrett\u2019s refusal to acknowledge a simple fact: the Constitution gives a president no power to delay an election. That\u2019s not a matter of interpretation. But perhaps she felt it was a slippery slope toward having to answer more questions about a potential election challenge. Barrett attempted to dispel questions about whether she can set aside her Catholic views in her jurisprudence by hitting a softball pitch from Graham: \u201cI can. I have done that in my time on the 7th Circuit.\u201d Much of the initial questioning, from Republicans and Democrats, was serious and substantive. But after the opening rounds, it was as though everyone decided they weren\u2019t moving the ball and the senators reverted to giving long speeches, with Barrett sitting there as a prop. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES Republican Mike Lee held forth on the evils of court-packing. Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, wielding charts, delivered a stemwinder on a vast right-wing conspiracy that supposedly picks, promotes and benefits from conservative judges. Ted Cruz, while not quite reading \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d went on and on about the Bill of Rights and asked such penetrating questions as: What are your greatest talents? Do you speak a foreign language? Do you play any instruments? \u201cWhat advice would you give to little girls?\u201d In fact, Graham began the hearing with a disquisition on the flaws of ObamaCare and his party\u2019s determination to replace it. That was a tougher sell, given that the administration has offered no health plan, and the chairman was playing defense after Democrats spent much of Monday describing the threat to the Affordable Care Act. Look, these SCOTUS hearings have become an elaborate kabuki dance, where nominees of both parties portray themselves as impartial defenders of legal ideals, then largely vote the way their presidential benefactors intended. There are exceptions, especially with John Roberts in a couple of high-profile cases, though his influence will be diminished on a 6-3 conservative court. Amy Coney Barrett did nothing yesterday to diminish her chances of becoming Trump\u2019s third Supreme Court justice. Her detractors may seen her as evasive, her supporters as appropriately cautious, but she is following a path long blazed by others named to the high court.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, captured victory Tuesday in a Nebraska Democratic congressional primary, boosting the hopes of liberal activists. The win by Eastman \u2013 who unsuccessfully sought the seat two years ago -- in the state's 2nd congressional district sets up a highly anticipated 2018 general election rematch with Republicans and serves as a rebound for progressive candidates in 2020 races. Eastman trounced her centrist primary opponent, Ann Ashford, securing more than 60 percent of the vote as she moves forward to November\u2019s election. It was a significant increase from her first win in 2018 primary when she narrowly upset the moderate Rep. Brad Ashford by less than 1,500 votes. She went on to lose to the current incumbent GOP Rep. Don Bacon. Kara Eastman, a progressive backed by high-profile Democrats, captured victory Tuesday in a Nebraska Democratic congressional primary. (Kara Eastman for Congress Facebook page) GOP POISED TO RETAKE KATIE HILL'S CALIFORNIA SEAT, AS TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATE WINS BIG IN WISCONSIN \u201cWe are building a COALITION,\u201d Eastman tweeted Tuesday. \u201cIf you are going to defeat the regressive tide of Trumpism in our state, we do it with kindness and inclusion and empathy and honesty. We welcome ALL Democrats to our movement! We welcome Independents and disgruntled Republicans too. Let's do this.\u201d Her victory will be seen as a rallying cry for progressives who have so far had mixed results in House primaries from the momentum of their strong showing in 2018. Highly touted candidates like Texas\u2019 Jessica Cisneros and Ohio\u2019s Morgan Harper were beaten by longtime Washington incumbents. But Illinois\u2019 Marie Newman and California\u2019s Georgette Gomez -- both candidates backed by Justice Democrats, a campaign PAC started by Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign workers -- were able to secure victory and advance to their general elections. However, Eastman faces a difficult path towards defeating current incumbent Don Bacon, who easily took his primary with 90 percent of the vote. Both Cook Political Report and Politico currently rate the election as \"Lean Republican\" and it\u2019s a district where President Trump\u00a0won by 2.2 percent in 2016. Bacon has voted in line with the president more than 90 percent\u00a0of the time since being elected to congress back in 2016. WISCONSIN SPECIAL ELECTION GOES TO GOP'S TOM TIFFANY; TRUMP TAKES NEBRASKA PRIMARY President Trump this week tweeted support for Bacon in the primary. \u201c@DonJBacon is doing a tremendous job for Nebraska! He served our Country as an Air Force General, and now he serves our Vets, Farmers, and Small Businesses. Strongly supports the Second Amendment. Don has my Complete & Total Endorsement! #NE02\u201d he said. After the results were in Tuesday, the candidates wasted no time in sparring with each other. \u201cKara Eastman's extremist agenda will skyrocket our taxes to pay for a government takeover of healthcare and 'free'\u00a0college for everyone. I voted to cut taxes for hard-working Nebraska families and #smallbiz in #NE02. Kara's ideas are #ALittleOutThere,\u201d Bacon tweeted Tuesday night. Eastman shot back: \u201cFriends. This is a preview of what this election will entail. :) Don Bacon will try to SCARE you. Throughout history, this has been a COMMON tactic but if we all see it for WHAT IT IS, it doesn't work. We wish you a happy election Congressman. You'll be going home soon. :)\u201d Eastman is a strong candidate to flip the seat. She lost by only 5,000 votes in their original matchup in 2018 (2 percent). Despite her progressive stances, which include supporting a path to Medicare for all and no government restrictions on access to abortion. She\u2019s raised almost $850,000 so far during this cycle. The district is crucial for Republicans to win if they have any hope of retaking the House majority. The GOP currently holds 196 seats in the House and needs to pick up at least 18 to retake a majority. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The ruling would, for now, continue to allow women to obtain an abortion pill by mail during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The FDA has approved mifepristone to be used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy or manage a miscarriage.

            "article_content": "The court ruled 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court's liberal justices; Trump 2020 senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis joins the debate. Newly obtained testimony shows\u00a0Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) officials and a tissue procurement company admitting\u00a0that infants were either born alive or showed\u00a0signs of life, such as\u00a0a beating heart, after leaving the mother\u00a0during\u00a0abortions. The testimony came as part of PPFA's civil suit against activist and Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden, who claimed the organization and one of its procurers, Advanced Biosciences Resources (ABR),\u00a0benefited from\u00a0infanticide.\u00a0Released Tuesday, Daleiden's compilation of depositions\u00a0showed\u00a0Jon Dunn, a PPFA executive,\u00a0plainly admitting\u00a0on camera that his affiliate in California saw an infant born alive and then die \"seconds\" after the child left the mother's womb. \"I know they kept it warm and comfortable for the very brief period that it was alive.\u00a0I don't think there was even time to call 911. It was a matter of seconds,\"\u00a0Dunn said. Neither Dunn nor PPFA responded to Fox News' requests for comment. SWORN DEPOSITIONS RAISE NEW QUESTIONS IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD FETAL TISSUE CONTROVERSY Dunn estimated that the incident occurred about 20 years ago,\u00a0but other depositions in Daleiden's video indicated that live births may happen at such clinics multiple times a year. Dr. Deborah Nucatola -- the medical director who infamously discussed \"crush[ing]\" fetuses\u00a0in a way that would yield intact\u00a0tissue --\u00a0told Daleiden's attorney she was \"sure\" she'd seen nonviable fetuses exit the uterus. By nonviable, she meant \"not capable of survival.\" Nucatola said she didn't recall seeing various signs of life\u00a0in these cases (movement, indication of breathing\u00a0and a beating heart). Perrin Larton, ABR's\u00a0tissue procurement manager, similarly admitted to knowledge of fetuses leaving the mother, sometimes \"intact\"\u00a0or with closed abdomens. That generally occurred \"once every couple of months,\"\u00a0she said, and in those cases,\u00a0ABR would perform a dissection to obtain the desired tissue. UNSEALED DOCS SHOW PLANNED PARENTHOOD CHARGED $25G FOR BODY PARTS, BLOOD SAMPLES WITHIN MONTHS Although ABR has worked with PPFA for years, Larton claimed she'd\u00a0never heard of deliveries\u00a0like that happening at a PPFA affiliate.\u00a0Larton also maintained that the fetuses weren't alive, but admitted seeing hearts that were \"beating independently.\" \"There are -- I can see hearts that are\u00a0in -- not in an intact POC [product of conception]\u00a0that are beating\u00a0independently, but they're not attached to anything,\" Larton said in a transcript reviewed by Fox News.\u00a0POC is a term used to describe the fetus or its body parts. But, according Dr. Forrest Smith, an OB-GYN who\u2019s performed thousands of abortions, both Nucatola and Larton provided answers that indicated they or their employees witnessed live births. \"I sincerely hope Ms. Larton never comes to understand the implications of her seeing detached hearts beating independently because then she would have to confront the realization that with intact fetuses that just 'fell out,'\u00a0she was actually vivisecting and killing a living fetus,\" Smith told Fox News. Larton did not respond to Fox News' multiple requests for comment. Planned Parenthood, where Nucatola has worked as a medical director, also did not respond to multiple requests. WHITE HOUSE RIPS SUPREME COURT'S 'UNFORTUNATE RULING' ON LOUISIANA ABORTION CLINIC RESTRICTIONS Daleiden's video came amid a broader debate about late-term abortions and the level of care infants deserved to receive if they survived attempted terminations. Daleiden argued that his most recent video showed a two-fold violation of law that amounted to \"murder for hire.\"\u00a0Specifically, he alleged that PPFA shirked its responsibilities under the federal Born-Alive Infants Protection\u00a0Act -- which extended legal protections to surviving infants -- under the assumption they would receive compensation for the individual fetuses' tissue. The bill's language specified that \"born alive\" referred to \"the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.\" It applied to infants regardless of \"whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\" Fox News previously reported on unsealed invoices that showed a Planned Parenthood affiliate charging $24,940\u00a0to StemExpress, a tissue-procurement company, involving more than 200 POCs. Planned Parenthood has defended itself by claiming the charges were related to transportation and time spent by staff. The invoices didn't mention either of those, however, nor did they contain the word \"reimbursement.\" Instead, they assigned a fee per body part. Specifically, the previously released contract between those organizations showed that the exchanges were based on \"POC determined in the clinic to be usable\u201d \u2014\u00a0a key distinction in Daleiden\u2019s argument that PPFA was commodifying human remains. PPFA has vehemently denied selling fetal tissue and has offered apparently conflicting\u00a0answers on whether it let infants die in its care. In a statement from 2013, the organization appeared to clarify that it offered \"appropriate care\" to infants and their mothers. In 2018, its Kentucky affiliate flatly denied that physicians committed infanticide.\u00a0The national office also condemned a bill that year that would impose criminal penalties on doctors who didn't provide abortion survivors with\u00a0life-saving care. \"Medical guidelines and ethics already compel physicians facing life-threatening circumstances to respond. Doctors and clinicians oppose this law because it prevents them from giving the best care to their patients,\" the group said. Daleiden has been sued by PPFA successfully \u2013\u00a0earning the group\u00a0$2 million in damages \u2013\u00a0and has been facing\u00a0a related criminal prosecution that he and his lawyers described as a gross abuse of power. Tuesday's video likely will add to the already mounting scrutiny surrounding PPFA and ABR. Just last week, more than\u00a060 members of Congress requested the Justice Department provide an update on its investigation into Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue practices. DOJ has remained silent about the investigation since it was reported in 2017. The department did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. \"How long will public authorities permit Planned Parenthood and their associates to sell living children inside and outside the womb and then kill them through organ harvesting?\" Daleiden asked Tuesday.\u00a0\"The DOJ has vigorously prosecuted the sale of eagle body parts. Surely selling human body parts after cutting them out of an infant with a beating heart is at least as grave of a crime.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When the Senate referred PPFA to DOJ for criminal investigation, it included referrals for ABR and other tissue procurement companies. While it's unclear how the administration will proceed, it could face growing calls related to ABR after a recent finding from the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch. The group claimed it obtained records showing that the Food and Drug Administration entered into contracts \"to acquire 'fresh and never frozen'\u00a0tissue from 1st\u00a0and 2nd\u00a0trimester aborted fetuses for use in creating 'humanized mice'\u00a0for ongoing research.\"",

Florida Democrats have cast their vote through mail-in voting in sweeping numbers, outpacing Republican absentee\u00a0ballots by more than 400,000 votes, according to state election numbers. President Trump won by a slim margin in 2016 in the number of votes cast through mail-in ballots, surpassing Democrats\u00a0with\u00a0more than 58,000 votes. But it appears that Democrats will be leading the state for mail-in ballots during the 2020 election with nearly 1.6 million ballots requested, as opposed to the 1.2 million ballots requested by Republicans. TRUMP CAMPAIGN KICKS OFF FLORIDA 'FIGHTERS AGAINST SOCIALISM' BUS TOUR Though the unprecedented number of mail-in ballots already received could be a result of the expected decrease of in-person voting due to the coronavirus, it could also mean that more Democrats are going to be voting in the General Election. President Trump won Florida by a slim margin in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by 1.2 percent, according to The New York Times. Trump headed to Florida earlier this week in his first trip after\u00a0his coronavirus diagnosis, a signal that the campaign is focusing on Florida voters. Donald Trump Jr. also made his way to Florida over the weekend\u00a0as a part of the campaign\u2019s Fighters Against Socialism Bus Tour, where he warned Floridians that\u00a0their \u201cFreedoms are at stake,\u201d\u00a0according to the Tampa Bay Times.

A poll by the University of North\u00a0Florida\u00a0Public Opinion Research Lab found that Trump is leading amongst voters 65 years of age and older\u00a0by three percent, though there is growing concern that he is losing the support of senior supporters.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u00a0this week repeated his concern that President Trump might try to \"steal\" the 2020 election, citing the president's repeated comments on the reliability of mail-in ballots. Biden made the remarks Thursday during\u00a0a virtual fundraiser hosted by actress\u00a0Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played the first female vice president in the TV show \"VEEP.\" \"This president is going to try to indirectly steal the election by arguing that mail-in ballots don't work.\u00a0They\u2019re not real. They\u2019re not fair,\" Biden said. Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, speaks Tuesday, June 30, 2020, in Wilmington, Del. (Associated Press) CHARLEMAGNE THA GOD SAYS BIDEN SHOULD 'SHUT THE EFF UP FOREVER' AFTER CALLING TRUMP 'FIRST' RACIST POTUS Trump, and many Republicans, have raised concerns about the potential for fraud as many states move to elections that are conducted largely or almost entirely by mail. They argue\u00a0that mass-mailing ballots to Americans creates more opportunity for bad actors. \"Mail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation\u2019s History! #RIGGEDELECTION,\" Trump tweeted this week. The president and some on the right have also made a distinction between mail-in voting and absentee voting, which has been disputed by Democrats and some fact-checkers, after it was pointed out that Trump and many in his administration have voted absentee before. BIDEN SAYS TRUMP WILL ATTEMPT TO 'STEAL' PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \"Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins. Rigged Election!!!\" Trump tweeted earlier this month. Democrats and others, citing studies, have said that fraud in mail-in or absentee voting, however it is termed, is rare. Biden's Thursday comments were the latest from both him and Trump -- potentially casting doubt\u00a0over the legitimacy of the fall election. Biden, in a June appearance on \"The Daily Show,\" said his \"single greatest concern\" was that Trump will \"try to steal this election. \"This is a guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent, voting by mail, while he sits behind the desk in the Oval Office and writes his mail-in ballot to vote in a primary,\"\u00a0 Biden told host Trevor Noah. And Trump in a \"Fox News Sunday\" appearance earlier this week refused to tell host Chris Wallace that he would accept the outcome of the fall election. \"And you know what? She\u2019s the one that never accepted it,\" Trump said of Hillary Clinton and the 2016 election. TRANSCRIPT: 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY' INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP \"I agree,\" Wallace responded. \"She never accepted her loss and she looks like a fool,\" Trump said. \"But can you give a, can you give a direct answer you will accept the election?\" Wallace asked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I have to see,\" he replied. \"Look, you -- I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no, and I didn't last time either.\" Biden, in the Thursday fundraiser, also addressed a variety of other issues, including his climate plan\u00a0and the coronavirus. He criticized Trump's response to the crisis, and took a swipe at the president's rebooted daily briefings. \"He thinks he can fix that with a daily performance on TV,\" Biden\u00a0said.

More than 17 months after Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, allegations of President Trump hoping for help from Russia in an election are back. House Intelligence Committee Chairman\u00a0Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accused the Trump administration of seeking to conceal Russian interference in\u00a0the 2020 election after Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said his office would scale back\u00a0in-person election security briefings to Congress\u00a0in favor of written reports.

That doesn't make any sense unless the goal is not to allow members of Congress, the representatives of the American people, to ask questions,\" Schiff told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"Concealing the truth is concealing Russians are again intervening to help the president in his reelection,\" Schiff said. Democratic Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff of California. (Photo by Jim Lo Scalzo-Pool/Getty Images) Other critics of ODNI's decision were quick to say the Trump administration is playing into Russia's hands. \"It\u00a0just reinforces the pass that Putin is getting for this kind of behavior. He, of all people, is going to push the envelope,\" former DNI James Clapper told CNN on Saturday.\u00a0\"When you consider Putin's background here, you know, trained KGB officer who knows how to use his intelligence tools and does so very aggressively. ...

An Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)\u00a0official told Fox News the office is concerned about \"unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information\u00a0following recent briefings\"\u00a0\u2014 in other words, leaks. In a \"Sunday Morning Futures\" interview, Ratcliffe alleged that members of Congress had leaked classified information \"within minutes\" after the end of recent briefings. \"Within minutes of one of those briefings\u00a0ending, a number of members of Congress went to a number of different outlets and leaked classified information for political purposes,\" Ratcliffe told \"Sunday Mornings Futures.\" President Trump accused Schiff of leaking information without evidence on Saturday. \"Probably Shifty Schiff, but others also, LEAK information to the Fake News,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\"No matter what or who it is about, including China, these deranged lowlifes like the Russia, Russia, Russia narrative. Plays better for them. DNI Ratcliffe doing a great job!\" Schiff responded to the president's claims on Sunday. \"I haven't, my staff hasn't, I can't speak for what all the members of the committee have done or not done, including a lot of the Republican members,\" he told CNN. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senate Intelligence Committee Acting Chair Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Ratcliffe's decision was needed. \u201cDivulging access to classified information in order to employ it as a political weapon is not only an abuse, it is a serious federal crime with potentially severe consequences on our national security,\" Rubio said in a statement.\u00a0\"This situation we now face is due, in no small part, to the willingness of some to commit federal crimes for the purpose of advancing their electoral aims.\" John Ratcliffe testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee nomination hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, May. 5, 2020.

With the clock ticking toward\u00a0Election Day, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u00a0holds a nearly 10-point lead over President Trump\u00a0in an average of the latest national polls. But in the crucial battleground states where the presidential election will be won or lost, the most recent public opinion surveys point to a tighter race between the former vice president and Trump. THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, OFTEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT, TAKES ON OUTSIDED IMPORTANCE With four weeks to go until Nov. 3, an average of the latest national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics\u00a0indicates Biden leading Trump by 9 points,\u00a0up from a 6.9 point advantage a month ago. President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate former Vice President Joe Biden participate in the first presidential debate Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020, at Case Western University and Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) The average includes a new CNN survey released Tuesday that shows Biden surging to 16 point lead over the president \u2013 57%-41% - among likely voters nationwide. The CNN poll was conducted entirely after last Tuesday\u2019s first presidential debate between Biden and Trump and mostly after the president\u2019s hospitalization last Friday after contracting COVID-19. The average also includes an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey conducted after the first debate but before the president tested positive for the coronavirus that indicated Biden up by 14 points. The CNN and NBC surveys were conducted by live telephone operators. \"There\u2019s some sense that Biden got a little bit of a bump not only out of the debate, but with the president getting diagnosed with COVID,\" Daron Shaw, the Republican partner on the Fox News Poll and a member of the Fox News Decision Team, noted. Four years ago at this point in the 2016 presidential election, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a 4.6 point advantage over Trump. Clinton\u2019s lead would grow to roughly 7 points over Trump by mid-October before shrinking to 3.2 points on the eve of the November election. Clinton ended up winning the national popular vote by 2.1 points. But the race for the White House is not a battle for the national popular vote. It\u2019s a fight for the states and their electoral votes. And four years ago Trump narrowly edged Clinton in a number of the key general election battlegrounds \u2013 including flipping from blue to red the key swing states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin by razor-thin margins, to produce a large Electoral College victory to win the presidency. THE TOP 5 VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE MOMENTS IN HISTORY An average of the latest swing state polls compiled by Real Clear Politics shows Biden up by 3.5 points in Florida, 5.8 points in Michigan, 5.6 points in Wisconsin, and 6.5 points in Pennsylvania. Four years ago Clinton held the edge over Trump in the final polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with Trump narrowly leading in the election eve surveys in Florida. Biden also edges the president by 3.4 points in an average of the latest polling in Arizona, 1.2 points in North Carolina, 1.2 points in Ohio, .5 points in Iowa, and .3 points in Georgia, all states that Trump won four years ago. In Texas, a longtime GOP stronghold, an average of the most recent surveys indicates Trump up by 3.2 points over Biden. And in three states that Clinton narrowly carried in 2016, Biden currently tops Trump by 5.3 points in Nevada, 8.4 points in New Hampshire, and 9.4 points in Minnesota. \"There\u2019s always a lag between statewide polls and the national polls and its one of the reasons why it\u2019s important to continue to do national polling,\" Shaw, a polling veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns, pointed out. \"As battleground state polls come in over the next few days, my guess is that they\u2019ll probably show something similar, that is a very small tick up for Biden,\" he added. Biden has been cautious when commenting on public opinion polls while Trump has repeatedly blasted most of them for months. The president on Monday \u2013 as he vowed to return to the campaign trail \u201csoon!!!\u201d as he recovers from COVID-19 \u2013 once again tweeted that \u201cThe Fake News only shows the Fake Polls.\u201d Election Day is still four weeks away \u2013 which is an eternity in campaign politics. But voting is now well underway in much of America. Early in-person voting at polling stations is now underway in 17 states. And 37 states have already started sending absentee ballots to registered voters who\u2019ve requested them.",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director and \"employee of the year,\" endorsed President Trump at the Republican National Convention (RNC)\u00a0Tuesday while offering a graphic description of the abortion\u00a0procedure she said\u00a0made her leave the organization. \"I spent eight years working for Planned Parenthood.\u00a0But today, I am\u00a0a pro-life activist,\" said Johnson, whose story\u00a0sent shock waves through the media as she represented one of the most high-profile conversions to the anti-abortion cause. Speaking to millions via livestream, Johnson described how she saw \"an unborn baby fighting back\" against an ultrasound-guided abortion. \"Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen \u2013 an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction\u00a0... The last thing I saw was a spine twirling around in the mother\u2019s womb before succumbing to the force of the suction,\" she said. PLANNED PARENTHOOD, NARAL EMPLOYEES CALL OUT RACIST, 'TOXIC' WORK ENVIRONMENTS IN NEW REPORT Her detailed description\u00a0marked a tonal shift from usual convention speeches, but also came as the party endorsed an incumbent, who, during a presidential debate,\u00a0referenced babies being\u00a0\"ripped from their mothers' wombs\" in late-term abortions. But that type of bluntness is apparently what Johnson sought in her approach to the issue. Last year, she underwent an ultrasound that\u00a0amplified her baby's heartbeat to bystanders in Times Square. Prior to Tuesday's\u00a0speech, she wrote on Facebook: \"America will hear the barbaric reality of abortion.\u00a0No one will ever be able to again say they didn\u2019t know.\" \"For most people who consider themselves pro-life, abortion is abstract,\" Johnson told viewers on Tuesday. \"They can\u2019t even conceive of the barbarity.\u00a0They don\u2019t know about the Products of Conception room in abortion clinics, where infant corpses are pieced back together to ensure nothing remains in the mother's wombs; or that we joked and called it the 'Pieces of Children'\u00a0room. See, for me, abortion is\u00a0real.\u00a0I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like.\u00a0Did you know abortion even had a\u00a0smell?\" CATHOLIC ANTI-ABORTION LEADERS SCRUTINIZE PRIEST'S DECISION TO LEAD PRAYER AT DNC She framed the upcoming election as \"a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we\u2019ve ever had.\" After leaving her clinic in Texas, Johnson eventually founded an organization dedicated to pulling workers like herself out of the industry. She's become a heroic figure in the anti-abortion movement and saw her life come to the big screen last year in a recent biopic,\u00a0which also depicted the abortion she described in her RNC speech. But Johnson has also come under fire for claims she made regarding that particular abortion and her exit from Planned Parenthood in general. Reporting from\u00a0Texas Monthly\u00a0has raised a number of questions after interviewing Johnson and her former employees. Among them is Planned Parenthood's claim that it had no record of the ultrasound-guided procedure she described. Johnson stands by her story, though, claiming that Texas Monthly's reporting is based on the wrong document from Planned Parenthood,\u00a0and that the correct reporting document\u00a0wouldn't disclose if an abortion involves ultrasound guidance anyways. Her movie's depiction has also encountered pushback, although a former abortion doctor, Dr. Anthony Levatino, played the physician in that\u00a0scene of the movie. Levatino, who narrates\u00a0a video\u00a0detailing abortion procedures, claims the movie's depiction is accurate. Regardless, Johnson has become one of the many prominent faces of the anti-abortion\u00a0movement, and her appearance seemed to corroborate the party's recent boldness on the issue. The\u00a0content of her speech also echoed those of many others, like Live Action's Lila Rose,\u00a0who have praised President Trump's policies on the issue. Johnson's comments came too as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration pursued\u00a0investigations into her former employer's fetal tissue practices, and request for coronavirus relief funds.\u00a0Planned Parenthood has also challenged the administration in court and accused Trump of attacking women's health care through things like abortion-related conditions on Title X funding. Touting his judicial appointments and executive actions, Johnson claimed Trump\u00a0\"has\u00a0done more for the unborn than any other president.\" On Tuesday night, Planned Parenthood Votes accused Johnson of lying and blasted the Trump administration's agenda. \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s health centers are proud to provide sexual and reproductive health care services to all people in need of essential health care. President Trump\u2019s allies have never told the truth about safe, legal abortion -- tonight was no different,\" Planned Parenthood Votes Executive Director Jenny Lawson said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"While paid activists opposing abortion access like Johnson will continue to lie and stigmatize sexual and reproductive health care services, Planned Parenthood Votes will continue to shine a spotlight on the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s unconscionable attacks on abortion access and fight to elect leaders that are committed to protecting access to reproductive health and rights at the ballot box.\u201d Johnson currently runs\u00a0two organizations that she founded: And Then There Were None and Pro-Love Ministries. When asked about Lawson's\u00a0\"paid activists\" phrasing, the organization pointed to Texas Monthly's reporting on an 40 Days for Life leader Shawn Carney allegedly offering Johnson $3,000\u00a0for speaking gigs. A spokesperson for Johnson\u00a0denied that claim\u00a0and demanded proof of such allegations. In an interview with Fox News, Carney also denied making that type of offer.",

Gavin Newsom\u2019s executive order for an all mail-in ballot election. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee and California Republican Party sued Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0and the state's Secretary of State Alex Padilla on Sunday, claiming an executive order sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters in the state is an \"illegal power grab\" that invites potential fraud. Newsom's order, aimed at allowing voters to avoid exposure to coronavirus,\u00a0will send ballots to all registered voters including inactive voters. This\u00a0has led to concerns that ballots sent to people who have moved or died will end up being filled out and submitted anyway unless voter\u00a0rolls are inspected and cleaned out before ballots are mailed. Many Republicans have expressed concern that Democrats could try using these ballots improperly, to swing races in their favor. NEWSOM ORDER SENDING MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS SPARKS CONCERNS \"In a direct usurpation of the legislature's authority, Governor Newsom issued an executive order purporting to rewrite the entire election code for the November 2020 election cycle,\" read the complaint, filed Sunday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. \"This brazen power grab was not authorized by state law and violates both the Elections Clause and Electors Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\" The lawsuit\u00a0claimed Newsom \"has created a recipe for disaster\" by ordering ballots be sent to everyone registered to vote including inactive voters, arguing that \"it invites fraud.\" The Republicans also claimed that by giving Newsom the sole power over determining where and if in-person voting will take place, it will lead to \"arbitrary and disparate treatment of individual voters,\" violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. As examples of potential foul play, the complaint noted that mailed ballots easily could be intercepted by the wrong parties if they're mistakenly sent to the wrong addresses or if\u00a0the recipients lived in\u00a0large residential buildings. Additionally, the Republicans wrote, voters could be susceptible to pressure from others when voting outside the private, secret confines of a voting booth. The Republicans also claimed such large-scale mail-in voting could lead to misconduct involving third-party ballot collecters. The complaint sought an injunction against the order's enforcement and declaratory judgment from the court deeming it unlawful. \"Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom\u2019s executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. \"Newsom's illegal power grab is a recipe for disaster that would destroy the confidence Californians deserve to have in the security of their vote.\" Fox News reached out to Newsom's office for comment but did not get a response. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Former Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., filed his own lawsuit against Newsom over the order last week. Issa, who has been running for former Rep. Duncan Hunter's seat in the wake of his resignation, claimed in his complaint that Newsom's order could\u00a0cause the \"votes of countless voters to be thrown out or not counted.\" It also claimed Issa's campaign costs would increase and\u00a0it would\u00a0force him to\u00a0\"reevaluate his electoral strategy,\" Politico and\u00a0Courthouse\u00a0News\u00a0reported. Newsom and other Democrats, however, said the coronavirus pandemic warranted taking the drastic step of sending absentee ballots to everyone so voters did not have to expose themselves to crowds at polling sites, thus risking catching or spreading COVID-19. \"Elections and the right to vote are foundational to our democracy,\" Newsom said in a statement after signing the order earlier this month. \"No Californian should be forced to risk their health in order to exercise their right to vote.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Newsom\u00a0recognized when he announced the order that mail-in voting was not necessarily ideal, and emphasized\u00a0that Californians would continue to have access to in-person voting sites, so mail-in ballots will not be required. \"Mail-in ballots aren\u2019t a perfect solution for every person, and I look forward to our public health experts and the secretary of state's and the legislature's continued partnership to create safer in-person opportunities for Californians who aren't able to vote by mail,\"\u00a0he said.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden goes head to head with President Trump at the first presidential debate. President Trump and Democratic nominee\u00a0Joe Biden kicked off their first fiery\u00a0presidential debate Tuesday night, sparring over everything from the Supreme Court nomination, coronavirus and Biden's sons, with moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News admonishing Trump several times for interrupting. The first of three showdowns between Trump, 74, and Biden, 77, devolved into attacks on Hunter Biden, smarts and schoolyard name-calling. As Trump went on offense, Biden tried to shut him down by calling the\u00a0president a \"clown\" and a \"liar.\" Wallace scolded Trump repeatedly for not following the debate rules by\u00a0interrupting and the veteran newsman often played the role of a wrestling referee rather than a moderator. \"Gentlemen, I hate\u00a0to raise my voice, but\u00a0why shouldn\u2019t I\u00a0be different than the two of you?\" Wallace said. DEBATE GETS PERSONAL AS BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A \u2018CLOWN,\u2019 TRUMP TELLS BIDEN HE\u2019S NOT \u2018SMART\u2019 Trump came out\u00a0swinging, but Biden held his own and didn't fall into previous debate pitfalls where he cut his time short or stumbled to get out responses. The two men often talked over each other in a brawl that got unwieldy at times. The president touted his record in the White House on boosting the economy and how he handled the pandemic, proclaiming: \"There\u00a0has\u00a0never been an administration or\u00a0president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years, and that's despite the impeachment hoax.\" But Biden said under Trump the country has become weaker, sicker, poorer and more violent. \"You're the worst president America has ever had,\" Biden said\u00a0at one point. Biden sought to define himself as the steady leader of the Democratic Party and distanced himself from Bernie Sanders' health care\u00a0plan and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal. \"You just lost the left,\" Trump told Biden. TRUMP TARGETS HUNTER BIDEN'S FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS DURING HEATED DEBATE CLASH Trump accused Biden of failing to admonish violent rioters and stand up for law enforcement\u00a0in Democratic-led cities that have been unraveling with racial unrest. \"The people of this country want and demand law and order and you're\u00a0afraid to even say it,\" Trump said. Wallace asked Biden why he doesn't call the mayor of Portland, Ore.,\u00a0to bring in the National Guard to stop the violence. \"I don't hold public office now,\" Biden said, adding that \"the violence should be prosecuted.\" Wallace turned to Trump and asked him: \"Are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down?\" Trump said he'd be willing to do it, but then said: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left.\" \u201cAntifa is an idea, not an organization,\" Biden responded, referencing\u00a0FBI Director Christopher Wray's claim that Antifa was more of a movement or ideology. Proud Boys, the conservative\u00a0group, celebrated Trump's comments and started pitching merchandise with Trump's \"stand by\" words. The debate in Cleveland kicked off with Trump standing\u00a0by his Supreme Court pick of Judge Amy Coney Barrett and his push to get her confirmed by the Senate before the Nov. 3 election. \"We won the election. Elections have consequences,\" Trump said, justifying why\u00a0he appointed a nominee in an election year. BIDEN, TRUMP SPAR OVER COVID DEATH COUNTS: 'YOU WOULD HAVE LOST FAR MORE' Biden, who declined to say whether he supports packing the court or ending the Senate filibuster, said the American people should decide who succeeds the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Sept. 18. \"We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view,\" Biden said. The debate quickly devolved into Trump tussling Wallace and then with Biden over health care and the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Trump accused Biden of trying to get rid of private health insurance. \"Not true,\" Biden retorted. \"Your party wants to go socialist,\" Trump said. \"I am the Democratic Party right now,\" Biden said. He also hit back at Trump for his handling of the coronavirus and for wanting to repeal\u00a0ObamaCare's protections for preexisting conditions. Trump accused Biden of embracing Sen. Bernie Sanders' socialist \"manifesto\" and when Biden stood his ground, Trump said:\u00a0\"You just lost the left.\" Trump lobbed attacks on Biden, including on his smarts and crowd sizes. Biden tried to shut him down by calling him a liar, \"clown\" and asking, \"Will you shut up, man?\" \"Folks, do you have any idea what this clown is doing?\" Biden said at another point. BIDEN PUSHES BACK AGAINST TIES TO BERNIE SANDERS DURING FIRST DEBATE: 'I AM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY' Trump hit Biden for his 47-year record in Washington and accused Biden of wanting to keep the country shut down like a prison during the pandemic. \"There's nothing smart about you, Joe,\" Trump said. Trump went after Biden for his son Hunter's dealings at Burmisa in Ukraine, which served as the origin for Trump's impeachment. Biden defended Hunter as doing nothing wrong and said he's proud of his son for overcoming drug addiction. Biden went on to talk passionately about his late son, Beau, and his service to the country before his death from cancer in 2015. Biden mentioned the disparaging comments Trump reportedly made about veterans, as reported by The Atlantic. \"My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. ... He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes,\" Biden said. BIDEN ACCUSES TRUMP OF CORONAVIRUS LIES AS PRESIDENT PUSHES SPEEDY VACCINE TIMELINE Trump took the conversation back to Biden's other son: \"Oh, really? Are you talking about Hunter?\" \"I'm talking about my son Beau Biden,\" Biden said. \"I don't know Beau. I know Hunter,\" Trump said. It was the first presidential debate of the unprecedented 2020 election cycle, marred by a global pandemic and expanded early and mail-in voting opportunities to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Voting is already underway in many states, including the battlegrounds of\u00a0Pennsylvania, Michigan and\u00a0Minnesota. Nationwide nearly 1.3 million people have already cast their ballots either by mail or through early in-person voting, according to the U.S. Elections Project. The Trump campaign, which has tried to keep a robust travel schedule despite the pandemic, had pushed unsuccessfully for\u00a0a much earlier fourth debate to account for the new\u00a0voting schedules. Trump and his allies have for months depicted Biden as hiding from the media in his basement and have relished in an opportunity to face off with Biden, who would be unaided by a teleprompter. The Biden campaign has benefited from a record-shattering $364.5 million in fundraising in August and a consistent lead in the public polls nationally and in many swing states. Biden has sought to keep the focus\u00a0on Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has cost more than 200,000 lives in the United States. The next Biden-Trump debate is slated for Oct. 15 and the final one is Oct. 22. Vice President Mike Pence and Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., will face off next in the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7. Fox Business' Hillary Vaughn and Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich\u00a0contributed to this report.",

Though there has been speculation that Democratic voters will be more likely to vote by mail in the 2020 General Election than Republican voters, the number of Americans\u00a0who have cast their vote\u00a0so far has outstripped the number of early voters by this point in 2016,\u00a0by 10 fold. Over 8 million Americans have already cast their votes, which could mean this presidential election sees a record number in voter turnout, according to the United States Elections Project, which compiles election data. ELECTION 2020 VOTER TURNOUT COULD BREAK RECORD WITH MORE THAN 8M BALLOTS ALREADY CAST Though five states in the U.S. conduct their voting system largely or entirely through mail-in ballots, including Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Hawaii, none of these states were included in the more than 8 million votes already received. As of Friday, 1.7 million registered Democrats had returned their ballots, while only 750,000 registered Republican ballots had been received. Democratic ballots requested are nearly double that of Republican ballots as well, with more than 22 million Democratic ballot requests and just 13 million Republican ballot requests. An additional 14 million ballots have been requested by voters who have not registered with a specific party. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this many people voting so far ahead of an election,\u201d Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, who heads the election data website,\u00a0told Reuters. TRUMP AND BIDEN SUPPORTERS OUT IN FORCE ACROSS FLORIDA McDonald has reportedly predicted that due to the surge in voting, the U.S. could see 65 percent of eligible voters turn out for the 2020 presidential election \u2013 that means 150 million votes counted and the highest rate in voter turnout in the U.S. is since 1908. More than 50 million people have requested mail-in ballots this year, according to the data -- likely a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has repeatedly said that mass voter fraud will occur with the increase in voting by mail, but with scant evidence to support his accusations. Despite his warnings, many states extended their mail in voting system by either opening up early voting sooner, or by extending the deadline past election day to allow postmarked ballots the ability to be counted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Florida, which voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential race, is leading the nation with the number ballots already submitted.

            "article_content": "UBS President &amp; former Obama economic adviser Robert Wolf breaks down the study's results. EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden,\u00a0if elected president, would undo a number of key Trump administration\u2019s policies related to immigration, and specifically illegal immigration, a new report predicts -- concluding that the differences between the two candidates on the issues is \u201cstark.\u201d \u201cThe contrast between President Trump and Biden\u2019s immigration policies is stark,\u201d the report by the conservative Heritage Foundation, obtained by Fox News ahead of its release, says. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO BAR CONVICTED FELONS, GANG MEMBERS FROM ASYLUM \u201cIf Biden were to become president, he would return to many of the same immigration policies in place during the Obama administration. This would include protecting and expanding the DACA program, admitting at least 125,000 refugees annually and seeking amnesty for 11 million illegal aliens,\u201d it says. President Trump ran his 2016 campaign with immigration as a primary issue, particularly stopping illegal immigration across the southern border with Mexico, and kept it as a priority during his administration. Biden has promised to undo a number of the policies that Democrats have blasted as cruel. Trump has pushed to end the Obama-era\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that gives protection from deportation to some illegal immigrants who came to the country as children. However, he has hit roadblocks, particularly in the Supreme Court. Biden, the report notes, would give DACA recipients (whom he calls \u201cDreamers\u201d) a roadmap to citizenship and reinstate the DACA program. \u201cBiden would also make \u2018Dreamers\u2019 eligible for federal student aid (loans, Pell grants) and debt-free community college,\u201d it says, also noting that the term \u201cDreamer\u201d is broader than just the 825,000 DACA recipients and can refer to the at least 3.6 million illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. under the age of of 18 on the date a \u201cDreamer\u201d bill would be enacted. \"On the question of what author Lora Ries describes as\u00a0a \u201cgeneral amnesty,\u201d the report finds that Trump has \u201cindicated a willingness to discuss amnesty with Congress as part of a negotiation for other immigration amendments that he deems are needed\u201d -- but that he would likely face pushback from his base. \u201cIn a second term, President Trump would pursue merit-based immigration reform with Congress, navigate rescinding DACA while negotiating an amnesty with Congress (for anywhere from 800,000 to up to 11 million illegal aliens) and continue to secure the border in the face of strong COVID-economy immigration push factors,\u201d the report says. Biden, meanwhile would \u201caggressively advocate\u201d for legislation in Congress for a roadmap to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, claiming it would help the economy and provide relief for people living in the U.S. for years. The Heritage report also notes that Trump's travel restrictions on countries deemed to be national security threats -- including Libya, Iraq, North Korea, Venezuela and Yemen -- would likely be rescinded, with the Biden campaign describing it as a \u201cMuslim ban.\" \u201cIt is yet another abuse of power by the Trump administration designed to target primarily black and brown immigrants. Biden will immediately rescind the \u2018Muslim bans,\u2019\u201d his campaign website states. SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR KEY CASES ON TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES Another key area where the two differ is on the treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees. Biden would end a number of policies, including the Migrant Protection Protocols -- known as the Remain-in-Mexico policy. That policy keeps migrants in Mexico as they await their immigration proceedings, and has been hailed as reducing the pull factors bringing migrants to the border. Opponents say it puts migrants seeking asylum in harm's way. The report finds that Biden would also \u201cdramatically increase\u201d government resources for asylum seekers and a network of support for them. Similarly, on refugees, where Trump has taken a number of moves to limit the number admitted by the U.S., Biden would seek to increase the refugee cap from 18,000 to 125,000 and seek to raise that further. Biden would also seek to end the Trump public charge rule, which restricts green cards for immigrants judged likely to be reliant on welfare. The report also finds that Biden would expand \u201cfamily-based chain migration\u201d by broadening the definition of \u201cimmediate relative\u201d and approve family visa beneficiaries to enter the U.S. even if a green card was not yet available to them, the report says. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A Biden administration would also increase the number of permanent employment-based visas, as well as the number of H-1B high-skilled visas -- something the Trump administration has sought to limit. A Biden presidency is not the only event that could roll back some of Trump's policies on immigration. The Supreme Court this week agreed to hear two cases on challenges to policies -- specifically the Remain-in-Mexico policy and the construction of the wall at the border.

EXCLUSIVE: Republicans on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees are demanding answers on the arrests of pro-life protesters in Washington, D.C., in what they are calling \u201cunconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.\u201d House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, along with the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, James Comer, R-K.Y., on Monday penned a letter to Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband questioning the arrest of two people affiliated with Students for Life of America. Jordan and Comer noted that the students were arrested \u201cfor writing the phrase \u2018Black Pre-Born Lives Matter\u2019 in chalk on a public sidewalk\u201d in D.C. and were charged with defacing public or private property, with a punishment of a fine up to $1,000 and/or up to 180 days in jail. \u201cThis incident, in light of the District allowing other political messages to appear on public property, raises troubling questions about whether the District is respecting the constitutional rights of individuals in a viewpoint-neutral manner,\u201d they wrote.

The Special Operations commander who oversaw the mission\u00a0to assassinate Osama Bin Laden says he is a conservative but voted for Joe Biden because America needs \"a president with decency and a sense of respect.\" Retired four-star Admiral William McRaven touted his support for the Democratic presidential nominee in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal and criticized\u00a0President Trump's \"incompetence in handling the pandemic and the wildfires,\" as well as his response to social justice issues. McRaven never mentions the president by name in the piece.

Most important, I believe that America must lead in the world with courage, conviction and a sense of honor and humility.\" McRaven opined that America has lost its credibility and command on the world stage because of Trump's antics and said Biden would be a more fit leader. \"We need a leader of integrity whose decency and sense of respect reflects the values we expect from our president. We need a president for all Americans, not just half of America,\" he wrote. TRUMP TAKES AIM AT FAMILIAR TARGET: OBAMA McRaven joins the nearly 500 U.S. generals, admirals and intelligence officials -- including 22 retired 4-star officers -- who also announced they were backing Biden\u00a0in September. McRaven has previously faced criticism from the president, who has dismissed him as a Clinton supporter. Just last week, Trump attempted to peddle a baseless conspiracy theory put forth by QAnon on Twitter, after he retweeted a post from a since-suspended account that suggested bin Laden -- the terrorist responsible for the attacks on New York's Twin Towers in September 2001 -- is actually still alive. The post also claimed that former President Barack Obama and then vice president Biden killed SEAL Team 6 as part of an elaborate coverup. DOUG SCHOEN: BIDEN'S AHEAD IN POLLS-- BUT SO WAS HILLARY CLINTON. CAN TRUMP STILL WIN? Robert O'Neill, a former Navy SEAL on McRaven's team at the time of bin Laden's death and who is purported to be the one who fired the fatal shot in 2011, lambasted Trump for the false theory shortly after and defended the SEAL Team involved in the operation. Trump doubled down on the tweet after facing backlash, passing it off during an NBC Town Hall event as \"an opinion of somebody.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, McRaven said Trump's theory was \"crazy\" and \"off in left field.\" \"I didn't even think it was worth addressing because it was so crazy.

Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden blasted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Wednesday for what he described as her\u00a0\"radical disrespect and contempt\" for the First Amendment. \"I hope that all Americans ...\u00a0are going to be able to\u00a0come together to oppose the kind\u00a0of radical disrespect and\u00a0contempt for the First Amendment\u00a0and for First Amendment civil\u00a0liberties that Kamala Harris has\u00a0demonstrated throughout her\u00a0career,\" Daleiden told\u00a0\"Hannity.\" As California's attorney general, Harris sued Daleiden through an unprecendented application of an eavesdropping law, which he alleges was intended to supress his work. In 2015, Daleiden released secretly recorded videos of\u00a0Planned Parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue procurement. The videos sparked a media firestorm and prompted federal scrutiny that continues five years after their release. UNDERCOVER JOURNALIST SUING KAMALA HARRIS FOR CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS THROUGH PROSECUTION In December 2019, a\u00a0judge pared\u00a0down the eavesdropping case, which carries criminal charges,\u00a0lopping off five charges the court\u00a0said lacked \"probable cause to establish\" that some of the recorded conversations were\u00a0\"confidential communications\" under law. At the end of last month, a judge dropped three more charges in the case. \"I have\u00a0been on the receiving end of her abuse of power,\" Daleiden told Fox News host Sean Hannity. Under Harris, California authorities raided Daleiden's home for evidence -- prompting questions about her relationship with Planned Parenthood, which has donated to her and many other Democrats.\u00a0In May, Daleiden filed a lawsuit alleging that Harris conspired to violate his civil rights through a bogus prosecution. Planned Parenthood has described Daleiden's group as\u00a0\"discredited.\"\u00a0\u00a0Daleiden has been successfully sued by PPFA \u2013\u00a0earning them $2 million in damages, and continues to face some criminal charges. \"David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress intentionally waged a multi-year illegal effort to manufacture a malicious campaign against Planned Parenthood,\" Acting CEO Alexis McGill Johnson\u00a0said\u00a0in November. Planned Parenthood has denied selling fetal tissue and multiple state investigations have found that affiliates did not engage in illegal practices. While the federal government hasn't brought any criminal charges, the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee did send criminal referrals to the Justice Department, which opened an investigation into the group. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For Daleiden and others, the core of the ongoing saga\u00a0is\u00a0whether Planned Parenthood violated federal law by selling fetal tissue. Unsealed documents revealed\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0charged a biospecimen company nearly $25,000 for fetal tissue and maternal blood samples in 2012. Planned Parenthood has defended itself by claiming that its charges related to transportation and time spent by staff. The invoices don't mention either of those, however, nor do they contain the word \"reimbursement.\"\u00a0Instead, they assign a fee per body part. Specifically, the previously released contract between those organizations showed that the exchanges were based on \"POC determined in the clinic to be usable.\"",

President Trump on Monday said his campaign has \u201cnarrowed\u201d the location for where he will deliver his presidential nomination acceptance speech to two locations \u2014 the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania or the White House. \u201cWe have narrowed the Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech, to be delivered on the final night of the Convention (Thursday), to two locations - The Great Battlefield of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and the White House, Washington, D.C. We will announce the decision soon!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. The president's tweet comes after Fox News reported last week that his campaign was considering the possibility of having him deliver his convention acceptance speech on the South Lawn of the White House. A source familiar with the talks told Fox News last week that that was just one of several options the campaign is considering, but told Fox News nothing has been finalized. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked about the two locations on Monday, but said she \"won't get ahead of the president.\" \"The president has done a lot to bring this country together,\" she said, when asked about what a speech at Gettysburg could represent.\u00a0\"We\u2019ve faced unprecedented challenges and he's\u00a0worked to ensure that\u00a0Americans are best equipped to rise above the challenges we face.\" TRUMP CALLS ON PORTLAND TO 'BRING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD' AS VIOLENT RIOTERS CONTINUE CLASH WITH POLICE The discussions come as the\u00a0convention details\u00a0remain in flux, and as the campaign and the Republican National Committee continue to adjust their plans amid the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, the Trump campaign and the RNC dramatically downscaled the convention by canceling planned celebratory events in Jacksonville, Fla., amid a surge in cases in the state, and refocused their attention to convention business back in the original convention site of Charlotte, N.C. The source told Fox News that there has been a lot of \u201cchatter,\u201d and that the White House location is just one option of several they are considering, stressing that a final decision has not yet been made. Meanwhile, the\u00a0RNC last month said\u00a0\u00a0\u201ca few hundred delegates\u201d will be in\u00a0Charlotte, N.C.,\u00a0on Monday, Aug. 24\u00a0for convention business, which will include the formal nomination of\u00a0the president.

            "article_content": "Democratic senator provides insight into how they will try to keep Judge Amy Coney Barrett off the Supreme Court. In just a few weeks, American voters will cast the last ballots of the 2020 election. And while that seems like such a short time from now, it\u2019s a lifetime in the era of Trump, where we move from scandal to scandal with every tweet and inconceivable new revelation. Only weeks ago, we lost an icon in Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a woman who spent her life fighting to protect women\u2019s rights, voting rights, civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and so much more. Hours after the announcement of her passing, we witnessed the\u00a0hypocrisy\u00a0of Senate Republicans as they stated their intent to fill her seat. Although only four years ago, when Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, they argued that with a presidential election on the horizon, the people should decide who should nominate the next Supreme Court justice. BARRETT TO PRAISE SCALIA IN OPENING HEARING STATEMENT, SAY COURT SHOULD NOT MAKE POLICY When Scalia\u2019s seat became open, we were nine months away from the election and almost a year away from the start of a new presidential administration. And now, with all that is going on in our country including, but not limited to, a president who has\u00a0COVID-19, seven million Americans infected, more than 210,000 lives lost, and 30 million unemployed Americans facing an uphill economic and health care crisis, Senate Republicans insist on nominating and confirming a new Supreme Court justice. That\u2019s despite the fact that a majority of Americans\u00a0polled\u00a0believe this seat should be decided by the winner of the election \u2013 an election in which more than\u00a0five million\u00a0people, including me, have already cast their ballots. One thing is crystal clear. This is not the right time to continue an already rushed nomination and possible confirmation of a new Supreme Court justice. Americans, especially women, have too much to lose if Judge\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed. And Senate Republicans need to respect the wishes of Justice Ginsburg and the American people to have whoever wins this election make the nomination. There is a great deal on the chopping block if\u00a0Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court. Although President Trump and Senate Republicans are trying hard not to admit it, Barrett has made it clear that she\u00a0opposes Roe v. Wade, a decision made more than 40 years ago and of which 70 percent of Americans agree. Are we ready for more than 40 years of progress to be undone? If Roe is overturned, depending on where one lives, one of the most important decisions of a woman\u2019s life could be decided not by her and her doctor, but by politicians. Health care\u00a0is also on the line. In the midst of a global pandemic, the Affordable Care Act could be abolished. That would mean millions of Americans losing their health coverage, ending protections for people with pre-existing conditions and overturning rules allowing young people to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance. Is this what we as Americans want from the highest court in the land? Are we ready for more than 40 years of progress to be undone? We know what Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for, and what she wanted. \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,\" she\u00a0said in a statement dictated to\u00a0her granddaughter, Clara Spera, according to\u00a0NPR. For everything Justice Ginsburg has done to help our country make good on its promises, no matter race or gender, we as Americans owe her the respect of honoring her wish. When she made that statement, Justice Ginsburg was thinking of us \u2013 every woman and every person who has been kept out of the halls of power. Justice Ginsburg said, \u201cwomen belong in all of the places where decisions are made.\u201d I often think about how this served as a guiding principle in her life and work. And right now, as you read these words, Americans, millions of them women, have already made a decision at the ballot box. Some Senate Republicans have argued that elections have consequences and picking a Supreme Court justice is just one of them.\u00a0 But going back on your word and against the will of the people will have its own consequence.

Yes, the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett is a threat to what we\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve and it will be an uphill battle, but if Democrats flip the Senate on Nov.\u00a03, what could result is the opportunity to see the highest court in the land reflect the views and values of our nation.

            "article_content": " Beginning the college year during the coronavirus pandemic is difficult enough for millions of students. But the beginning of my freshman year at Transylvania University in Kentucky is being made even more difficult by an unwarranted attack against me by the cancel culture due to my conservative views. Even before starting college I was the subject of a lot of unwanted attention following media coverage of a school trip I took in January 2019 to Washington, D.C. I wore a Make America Great Again hat, expressing my support for President Trump, as I participated in a pro-life rally at the Lincoln Memorial with fellow students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky. As you may have heard, I was confronted by a Native American activist who stood in front of me and began chanting and banging a drum. I simply stood there and smiled, but some media accounts falsely portrayed me and my fellow students as aggressors who provoked a confrontation. I filed a lawsuit against The Washington Post and CNN. WASHINGTON POST SETTLES NICHOLAS SANDMANN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT IN COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CONTROVERSY With that behind me, I recently began my freshman year at Transylvania University in Kentucky. But unbelievably, an official of the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 a liberal group that claims to be dedicated to defending free speech \u2014 criticized the university last week for admitting me, saying my admission was a \u201cstain\u201d on the school. In a Facebook post, Kentucky ACLU staffer Samuel Crankshaw wrote of me that\u00a0\u201cthis kid clearly is a provocateur in training with no intention of learning. He exists only to troll, intimidate and play victim.\u201d ACLU STAFFER FUMES AT UNIVERSITY FOR ACCEPTING NICK SANDMANN, CALLS IT A 'STAIN' ON THE SCHOOL: REPORT I have never met Crankshaw. He knows nothing about me besides news stories regarding my trip to Washington and lawsuit. Yet still, he tries to cancel me and demand that I be denied admission to college. Why? Because he seems outraged that my\u00a0conservative values don\u2019t align with his left-wing ideology. So should only liberals and those on the far-left be able to get a college education? Should there be an ideological purity test required that bars conservatives and Republicans? That\u2019s a pretty frightening idea and sounds like something you would expect in a totalitarian state, not a democracy where we are all guaranteed free speech by the First Amendment to the Constitution The ACLU claims to support free speech but, at least where Crankshaw seems to be concerned, that only applies if you share his ideas. While he works for an organization founded on inclusivity, he is quick to exclude differing opinions. If you are a conservative like me, watch out. The intolerant left might come for you, too. As a graduate of Transylvania University, Crankshaw doesn\u2019t deem me worthy of sharing an alma mater with him. How would he have felt if he had been denied admission as a liberal? I imagine he would have been rightfully outraged. But he hypocritically wants my dreams of a higher education canceled. Jonathan Turley, a scholar known for being a strong advocate of free speech, responded on his blog to defend the need for free speech and defend me from Crankshaw\u2019s attack. \u201cI have\u00a0previously written, as a long supporter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), about my concern over how the venerable group has changed under its current leadership, including a departure from its long robust defense of free speech.\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cRecently, the ACLU has abandoned its famed neutrality and has not supported some on the right while supporting those on the left.\u201d So should only liberals and those on the far-left be able to get a college education? Should there be an ideological purity test required that bars conservatives and Republicans? And then, referring to Crankshaw\u2019s attack on me, Turley wrote that \u201cit is far more alarming to see an ACLU official rallying people against a young man whose chief offense appears to be that he is publicly (and unapologetically) conservative and pro-life.\u201d Turley is right. Colleges have a reputation of being toxic places for conservative, pro-life ideas like the ones I hold. But an alumni assuming I\u2019ll act in a certain way before even meeting me? Well, that\u2019s a new low. Crankshaw will be sad to learn that, against his wishes, I feel that I am treated fairly as a student and am looking forward to learning and forming my own opinions over my next four years at Transylvania University. Sadly, I\u2019m not the only young Republican being attacked for my political beliefs. Conservative students on college campuses across America face attacks just for speaking out and exercising their First Amendment rights. If the threats to students like me don\u2019t come from the left-leaning administrators, the threats come from fellow students who call on campus leadership to cancel events or shut down student organizations that dare challenge their left-wing view of the world. The idea of \u201cfree speech zones\u201d that some colleges and universities create in an attempt to address this problem is utterly ridiculous. Our entire country is a free speech zone, enshrined by our Founding Fathers in the Constitution.\u00a0And no one has the right to cancel the Constitution or its First Amendment. Recently I became a part of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s reelection team because the Kentucky Republican \u2014 just like President Donald Trump \u2014 will not bend to liberals who wish to rewrite history or cancel you. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Sen. McConnell\u00a0said during the Republican National Convention he \u201cwon\u2019t be bullied by a liberal media intent on destroying America\u2019s institutions.\u201d Sen. McConnell and President Trump are the exact leaders we need at a time when liberal mobs take glee in destroying our lives and erasing our voices. Kentucky and our nation need leaders who will stand their ground and empower young conservatives like me to do so as well. I don\u2019t advocate barring liberals or even socialists from going to college. It is wrong for any of us to demean people who hold different beliefs. Now more than ever, we need more speech, not less. We need to hear new ideas and to learn from others. That is exactly what I and so many students returning to school want to do. I invite Democrats to join us. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Just like President Trump and Sen. McConnell, I\u2019ve fought against those who wish to silence my opinions. While our conservative values might not always be the popular ones held by celebrities and athletes on TV, we will not stop speaking out for what we believe is right. And to those who are inclined to write my future for me, I say let me define myself.\u00a0I will not be canceled.",

            "article_content": "Trump 2020 campaign director of press communications Erin Perrine and Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden react. The New York Times was quick out of the blocks with the Democratic pitch that Kamala Harris is a \u201cpragmatic moderate.\u201d It\u2019s pulling your leg. Joe Biden\u2019s running mate\u00a0had the most liberal voting record in the Senate last year \u2014 surpassing even Bernie Sanders \u2014 according to government watchdog GovTrack. Harris advocates late-term abortion, thinks Catholics are not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, has tried to criminalize climate-change denial and the manufacture of guns, wants to give taxpayer-funded health care to illegal immigrants and, as California\u2019s attorney general, wielded power like a callous autocrat. AUTHOR CLAIMS HARRIS 'DEEP-SIXED' RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS ID'ING CLERGY ACCUSED OF SEX ABUSE AS CITY DA But, if by pragmatic, the Times means this Barack Obama proteg\u00e9 will be whatever you want her to be, it\u2019s correct. Her record shows her to be a gifted shapeshifter. The San Francisco progressive is prepared to pose as a law-and-order centrist in crucial states where suburban voters are nervous about violent riots. The\u00a0panderer to the defund-the-police crowd\u00a0once compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the Ku Klux Klan, but was endorsed by police unions when she was California\u2019s top prosecutor. The hedge-fund darling presents herself as a woman of the people. She\u2019s an Indian\u00a0American candidate to one audience, an African\u00a0American one to another. She\u2019s the loyal understudy expected to usurp her benefactor if he wins. She\u2019s an anti-racist, MeToo feminist running alongside a\u00a0man she has accused of racism\u00a0and\u00a0has said she believes is a rapist. Like Biden, her moderate label is a phony play for swing states, but in this age, overloaded with hypocrisy as it is, it might work. Harris\u2019 role is to bring out a few extra minority voters and suburban women to the polls where it counts: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina. Yes, especially in North Carolina, where Black turnout is crucial. In a close race, where every vote will count, she is on the ticket to reassure centrists that Democrats really are on the side of law and order. To that end, Republican or progressive attacks on her record as a prosecutor play into her hands. Those \u201cKamala is a cop\u201d T-shirts won\u2019t hurt her with moderates who are aghast at the defund-the-police movement. No, the way to tackle shapeshifters is to pin them on their policies \u2014 and the radical-left, Sanders-sanctioned manifesto Biden has endorsed provides ample ammunition. At 55, Harris is 22 years younger than Biden, and questions about his mental acuity have many Americans expecting she will step into his shoes before his term is up. She is the presidential candidate by proxy, yet is protected from the usual scrutiny that goes with the position. She won\u2019t have to debate Trump. She doesn\u2019t even have to be likeable to voters \u2014 something her woeful primary-campaign performance suggests is a problem. What\u2019s more, the identity politics that\u00a0catapulted her into this powerful role\u00a0will provide her with an extra layer of immunity. The most glaring example is the feminist groups which have teamed up in a sinister attempt to intimidate the media into giving Harris a free pass. Activists from Emily\u2019s List, NARAL, Planned Parenthood, Time\u2019s Up and the National Women\u2019s Law Center wrote a letter last week to media organizations, warning them to be \u201ccareful about the choice of narratives for stories\u201d about Harris. \u201cWe will be watching you.\u201d Off limits are words such as \u201cambition,\u201d \u201clikeability\u201d and \u201celectability.\u201d No photos looking angry because that \u201cperpetuates racist tropes.\u201d So is reporting, \u201ceven as asides . . . on . . . looks, weight, tone of voice, attractiveness and hair.\u201d The Democrats are trying to stifle criticism before it begins. Unlike Biden, Harris might go out physically to campaign across the country, but she will be protected in a virtual basement. Biden calls himself the \u201ctransition\u201d candidate, and that\u2019s true in more ways than one. He means he is too old to seek a second term. But in another sense, he promises to be the transition ticket for a party engaged in a civil war between progressive insurgents and the establishment gerontocracy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER He and the ever-flexible Harris are the bridge from the old guard to the party that progressives are shaping. That new party currently is unelectable, but if Biden wins, they have plans to change the electorate \u2014 from normalizing illegal immigration to creating new Democratic states in Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. They also have fashioned a backup plan if voters wise up or Trump just outcampaigns them. This is the scenario was laid out by the Transition Integrity Project, an anti-Trump group stacked with Obama loyalists, \u00adGeorge Soros staffers and friendly journalists, which reportedly has been war-gaming ways to remove Trump from office in the case of a disputed election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Their aim is to sow chaos and doubt in the election process and refuse to accept a defeat, even to the extent of having former Army officers John Nagl and Paul Yingling muse in print this week about using the 82nd Airborne to dislodge Trump from the White House in January. The Dems are laying the groundwork to reject the election result. It\u2019s not exactly a vote of confidence in their new dream team. This column first appeared in the New York Post.

Wade ruling that legalized abortion\u00a0switched her support to pro-life movement after being paid to do, she said\u00a0in a stunning admission before her 2017 death. Norma McCorvey, who died at age 69 from heart failure, made the revelation in a documentary titled\u00a0\u201cAKA Jane Roe,\u201d which is slated to air Friday. \u201cThis is my deathbed confession,\u201d she said. \u201cI took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. I did it well too. I am a good actress. Of course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d She reportedly received\u00a0$450,000 in \u201cbenevolent gifts\u201d from the pro-life movement to change her stance, The Guardian reported. The documentary --\u00a0filmed in Texas in the final months of McCorvey's life -- will be broadcast on the FX cable channel. It explores her troubled upbringing and how she became the poster child for the pro-choice movement before her conversion to Christianity in the 1990s. Included in the film are scenes showing McCorvey\u00a0with a look of disappointment during the\u00a02016 presidential election night. \u201cI wish I knew how many abortions Donald Trump was responsible for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s lost count, if he can count that high.\u201d In an effort to set the record straight as she was nearing death, McCorvey confirmed she was pro-choice. \u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion, that\u2019s no skin off my ass,\" she said. \"That\u2019s why they call it choice.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., weighed in on the film via Twitter. \"Wow: Norma McCorvey (aka \u201cRoe\u201d of Roe v Wade) revealed on her deathbed that she was paid by right-wing operatives to flip her stance on reproductive rights,\" she wrote.\u00a0\"So, like many right-wing operations, it turns out a huge part of the anti-choice movement was a scam the entire time.\" The debate over the 1973 ruling hasn't subsided in the decades since, with\u00a0opposing sides of the issue\u00a0fighting tooth-and-nail to either preserve\u00a0or overturn the decision. It has since become somewhat of a litmus test for nominees to the high court and\u00a0White House\u00a0candidates. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Rev. Robert Schenck, an evangelical pastor\u00a0who worked with McCorvey after her conversion to Christianity, said the pro-life movement exploited her weaknesses for its own gain. \u201cWhat we did with Norma was highly unethical,\u201d Schenck said in the documentary, according to Reuters. \u201cThe jig is up.\u201d",

Washington, D.C. police violated the First Amendment\u00a0when officers arrested two anti-abortion activists who were writing\u00a0\"Black Preborn Lives Matter\" outside of\u00a0a Planned Parenthood location, one of the activists told\u00a0\"Tucker Carlson Tonight\"\u00a0Monday. \"This is a violation of our First Amendment right,\" said Warner DePriest, an employee of Students for Life of America (SFLA). \"This is viewpoint discrimination.\" Video footage shows police warning DePriest and SFLA student leader Erica Caporaletti that they would be arrested if they continued using sidewalk chalk outside of the Planned Parenthood Carol Whitehill Moses Center in northeast D.C. SFLA said it applied for an event permit that included a request to paint \"Black pre-born lives matter\" on the street outside of Planned Parenthood.\u00a0The organization claims that MPD granted them a permit to gather at Planned Parenthood and, in a separate conversation, verbally told them they would not be prevented from painting their\u00a0message on the street. DC\u00a0authorities, SFLA claims,\u00a0specifically requested they use temporary paint.

            "article_content": "Criticism of Amy Coney Barrett's faith is 'attempt to bring back an old standard that the Constitution of the United States explicitly forbids,' Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said during his opening statements. This week I proudly voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. For President Trump, it was his third Supreme Court appointment in fewer than four years. But this nomination was especially significant. It represents a sea change in the way Republicans choose and confirm Supreme Court justices. For the first time in decades, religious conservatives had a strong voice in the process. And the result was the most openly pro-life, pro-faith nominee of my lifetime. Amy Coney Barrett has left no doubt about her faith convictions. She is a devout Catholic and charismatic who has lived her faith in every walk of her life \u2014 choosing to teach at a Catholic university, publicly defending her church, mentoring Christian law students, and speaking to Christian legal groups. SEVERINO BLASTS CLAIMS BARRETT SHOULD RECUSE FROM ELECTION CASES: 'NEVER BEEN THE HISTORICAL STANDARD' And she has left no doubt about her convictions on life. Before she joined the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett openly condemned \u201cabortion on demand.\u201d She endorsed the \u201cright to life\u201d for every child, advocated for the unborn to be protected in law, and raised doubts in her academic writing and speaking about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that barred states and the federal government from outlawing abortion . In the past, judicial candidates like this didn\u2019t get nominated to the nation\u2019s highest court. The lesson the Republican establishment learned from the failed confirmation of Robert Bork in the late 1980s and the attempted destruction of now-Justice Clarence Thomas a few years later was this: the less said by Republican judicial nominees, the better. The shorter the public paper trail, the better. And the virtue of silence was especially encouraged when it came to the hot-button issue of life. That didn\u2019t stop Republican politicians from campaigning on the Supreme Court, of course. It didn\u2019t stop them from telling voters, for decades, that they would support pro-life judges and nominees faithful to the Constitution. But back in Washington, the Republican establishment sang a different tune. Trust us, they said. Let us do the vetting. Don\u2019t ask too many questions. And when religious conservatives dared to raise concerns, they were told not to talk too much about Roe or life lest they jeopardize \u201cthe process.\u201d Voters were left to watch as one Republican-nominated justice after another failed to be the pro-life, pro-Constitution originalists the politicians had promised. That\u2019s one reason I went to the Senate floor this past summer to vow that I would only support Supreme Court nominees whose record confirmed that they understood Roe was an act of judicial imperialism and that it was wrongly decided. No more private assurances, no more backroom winks and nods. I wanted evidence on the record that demonstrated the nominee, whoever it was, understood the clear difference between judging and legislating from the bench. President Donald Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas administers the Constitutional Oath to Amy Coney Barrett on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, after Barrett was confirmed by the Senate earlier in the evening. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Amy Coney Barrett more than met that standard. And that\u2019s why President Trump\u2019s decision to nominate her, after listening carefully to religious conservatives, was so significant. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER News reports indicate the usual Republican suspects had until recently regarded Barrett as \u201ctoo conservative\u201d because of her plainly stated views, and too likely to stall in the confirmation process. But President Trump rejected the conventional wisdom and nominated her anyway. In her nomination hearing, Barrett broke the pattern again: she refused to back away from her stated convictions on life or faith. She repeatedly explained to senators that she wouldn\u2019t pledge her vote on any case, but she would not apologize for her convictions or past statements and writings. And in the end, she won confirmation in the Senate with the support of all but one Republican. All that adds up to this: the days of nominees hiding their faith and downplaying their religious convictions as too \u201ccontroversial\u201d should be over. Our Constitution imposes no \u201creligious test\u201d for office; in fact, it excludes such tests. People of faith are welcome in public life and on the high court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And the days of nominees refusing to talk about life should be over too. Nominees cannot commit their votes in future cases, but they should be free to state their pro-life views, as Amy Coney Barrett did, and defend them. Justice Barrett\u2019s record on the Supreme Court will take years to develop and even longer to assess. But for religious conservatives, her confirmation is already a landmark.

            "article_content": "President Trump delivers remarks on protecting America's senior citizens. A leading pro-Democratic outside group that backs former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says it\u2019s spending $20 million to run a 10-week ad-blitz in three key general election battleground states this summer to spotlight what they say is President Trump\u2019s weakened support among seniors and small-town rural voters. American Bridge announced on Monday that its spots would start running on TV and radio this month through August in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, three so-called \"Rust Belt\"\u00a0states that Democrats had carried for a quarter-century in presidential elections that Trump narrowly won in 2016, helping him win the White House. BIDEN TOPS TRUMP BY 9 POINTS IN BATTLEGROUND TEXAS IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL The first commercials being released spotlight real seniors who backed Trump four years ago explaining why they\u2019re now supporting presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. \u201cI voted for Donald Trump in 2016. I thought he would be different, but it\u2019s gotten worse under Trump. The Trump economy works great if you\u2019re a wealthy person. If you\u2019re a working-class person, it\u2019s not working so well for you,\u201d says\u00a0John, a Wisconsin resident and Navy veteran who served in the Vietnam War. \u201cI can bet my life on most of what Joe Biden has to say. I wouldn\u2019t bet my life on the next three things that come out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth because one of them will probably be a lie,\u201d he emphasizes. In another spot, Janie from Pennsylvania noted that \u201cIn 2016, I voted for Donald Trump. If I have one word to describe him, I would say disappointed. Things would have been so much different if Joe Biden was president.\u201d American Bridge, which has served as the leading pro-Democrat opposition research shop for nearly a decade, argues that seniors are abandoning\u00a0the president \"in droves.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Trump won those 65 and older by 7 percentage points in his 2016 election victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. But he\u2019s down by 4 points among seniors, according to a new CNN poll, and trailing by 8 points in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was emphatic in his defense of Social Security and Medicare \u2013 two government programs that are popular among seniors. But the president\u2019s seen his support for seniors erode during the coronavirus pandemic, which has struck seniors harder than any other age group. Last month \u2013 as he unveiled a plan to lower the cost of insulin for many Medicare recipients \u2013 Trump called it \u201ca big day for seniors\u201d and touted his achievement as \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and a preview of things to come in a second term. \u201cSleepy Joe can\u2019t do this,\u201d Trump charged, adding \u201cI hope the seniors are going to remember it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "<br> As a lifelong Democrat, I am thrilled that Joe Biden has been projected as the winner of the 2020 election. Fox News and others have determined that he will be our next president. We need his leadership more than ever. This week, we\u2019ve broken COVID-19 records more than once as the virus spreads uncontrolled and millions of Americans still face economic issues caused by the lack of a response from the Trump administration. We\u2019ve watched as Donald Trump has lied repeatedly in trying to undermine our electoral process. Replacing his dangerous agenda with President-Elect Joe Biden will move us quickly from incompetence and apathy to experience, empathy, and progressive values. I am grateful to the Biden-Harris campaign for running a great race and delivering a message of unity, decency and a promise to help restore the soul of America. Joe Biden showed leadership and strength as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States in many ways, but especially when he chose Kamala Harris as his running mate. She brought energy and enthusiasm to the campaign and is ready to do the work of the people of this country. RICHARD FOWLER: BIDEN WINS 2020 ELECTION. AMERICA HAS SAID, 'YOU'RE FIRED,' TO TRUMP The Biden-Harris ticket earned more votes than any presidential ticket in history. And while that is remarkable, the historical significance of this moment should not be missed. I\u2019m referring to Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris. Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks to supporters at a campaign event Monday, Oct. 19, 2020, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux) Kamala Harris\u2019 historic election shatters one of America\u2019s highest glass ceilings for women in politics, and shows that our diversity truly is our strength. And, as Kamala has done in every office she\u2019s held,\u00a0 she continues to prove that those who are often forced to knock down the doors of power can make life better for all of us once they have a seat at the table. In my last piece, I mentioned that Kamala Harris was no stranger to being a ground-breaking candidate. She was the first African American woman and South Asian American woman to be district attorney of San Francisco, the first woman to be California\u2019s attorney general, and only the second African American woman to serve in the United States Senate. She was the first African American (and third woman) to run for vice president on a major party ticket, in addition to being the only woman of color to ever do so. And now, she will be the first woman in American history to serve as vice president. To say that this is a big deal for women, African Americans, Asian Americans and all Americans, is an understatement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER And as an incredibly qualified woman who has served at all levels of government, including running the largest state justice department in the country, I am particularly excited for the work that she will accomplish on behalf of the American people. When President-Elect Joe Biden chose her to be his running mate, he asked Sen. Harris to be the last\u00a0voice in the room. And how fortunate are we that she will be. How fortunate are we that she\u2019ll be the last person in the room advocating for those who are so often unseen and unheard? How fortunate are we that she\u2019ll be at the table advocating for access to affordable health care and economic relief as we still grapple with the devastating impact of COVID-19, protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, fighting for paid family leave, pushing for criminal justice reform and so much more? After the four years we\u2019ve all had under the corruption of the Trump administration, I would say that we are more than fortunate. During her time as attorney general of California, she took on the big banks to get homeowners the relief they needed during this country\u2019s worst mortgage crisis. Then she pushed for the California Homeowner\u00a0Bill of Rights in 2012, considered the nation\u2019s strongest foreclosure protection law at the time. That\u2019s the type of leader who I want in the room during a crisis \u2013 one who will fight for us, a leader who isn\u2019t afraid to push back, debate and make the case for the American people. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Over the life of this campaign, President-Elect Biden and Senator Harris\u00a0 have done just that -- they\u2019ve fought for all of us. And after a decade of being president of EMILY\u2019s List, with a simple and powerful mandate to help elect pro-choice Democratic women, I am proud to finally say Madam Vice President.

            "article_content": "Evangelist Dr.\u00a0Alveda King\u00a0weighed in on the controversy surrounding the alleged\u00a0deathbed confession of\u00a0Norma McCorvey\u00a0(Jane Roe)\u00a0in an interview with Fox News on\u00a0Thursday and said the idea of her acting as a hired gun or paid \"mercenary\" for the Christian right is a complete\u00a0falsehood. McCorvey, 69, passed away from heart failure in 2017, but posthumously made headlines this week\u00a0as\u00a0FX prepares to release a\u00a0documentary about her life titled: AKA Jane Roe. It is set to premiere on Friday, according to The Guardian. King, who works with Priests for Life and is the niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke with Fox News about her friendship with McCorvey, who was the plaintiff in the landmark 1973\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0case Roe v. Wade,\u00a0which legalized\u00a0abortion King lamented the politicization of the American icon's personal struggles after news broke that McCorvey had confessed to accepting lavish financial gifts, in exchange for her public support of Christianity and her embrace of the pro-life\u00a0movement.\u00a0\"It's sad,\" she told Fox News.\u00a0\"She was a lovely friend. I miss her.\" The Guardian story claimed McCorvey, who never actually had an abortion and gave her three children up for adoption,\u00a0told the filmmakers, \u201cI took their money and they\u2019d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say. I did it well too, I am a good actress.\u201d The article also claimed she'd received $450,000 in gifts from the pro-life movement to switch sides, so she could help them push their\u00a0political agenda. King, who had two abortions in her youth before becoming a\u00a0staunch pro-life advocate, released a video of her own on YouTube Thursday, refuting the documentary's narrative about McCorvey. King's voice is heard reading quotes from an article\u00a0she wrote for Newsmax\u00a0that\u00a0was published\u00a0on Thursday. DR. ALVEDA KING ON HER QUARANTINE ROUTINE: 'MY SPIRIT IS NOT CONFINED' \"Shameful fake news would have us believe that Norma McCorvey was a mercenary. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she said. \"For those of us who knew and loved Norma, we know that at the end, Norma loved God, and Norma loved life. \"Fake news\u00a0baited and switched on Norma just before her death,\" King continued.\u00a0\"According to the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, Norma wrote to him saying that she'd been booked for an interview for 'AKA Jane Roe.' Norma was so excited; they promised to let her tell her story; and told her they would pay her for it. From my personal perspective, they interviewed Norma and took her words out of context.\" She added, \"Norma McCorvey's conversion to Christianity in 1995 led her to become one of the most devoted pro-life advocates of our times. Her pro-life testimony is truly a gift of love.\" Fox News reached out to Fr. Pavone and he stood by King's claims. He said Norma was like a sibling to him and was prone to emotional mood swings due to trauma from her past. However, he maintained that she never lost her foundational beliefs in God or lost sight of the moral implications of abortion. \"I spoke to her almost every day,\" he told Fox News.\u00a0\"I became like a close brother to her for 22 years. I was her main guide in her process of healing and her involvement in the pro-life movement. We worked together professionally and\u00a0we became personal friends.\u00a0We\u00a0knew everything about Norma. She was completely\u00a0transparent with me.\" Pavone also said the idea that McCorvey's statement was a \"deathbed\" confession is another falsity, being peddled by a biased media. He claims to have text messages from her, during the time of the film's production, to support his story. \"She told me about this documentary during the days that it was happening. It wasn't a deathbed thing,\" he explained. \"She died in February of 2017. [Nick Sweeney]\u00a0was filming her in May of 2016.\u00a0So this notion that's being created that somehow before she left this world she decided to\u00a0finally tell the whole truth, is a bunch of hogwash. She and I were in communication.\" He added, \"You don't get to know Norma from an interview even if you interview her multiple time. We knew her ups and downs. We were never surprised by anything she said. That's how she vented. She did not change her mind about abortion. She was not play-acting. You couldn't play-act. It\u00a0was a deep journey of pain. She shed violent tears in confidential settings. We knew her better than any documentary person could.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0also highlighted\u00a0the story on social media this week and condemned the pro-life movement as a \"scam.\" \"Wow: Norma McCorvey (aka \u201cRoe\u201d of Roe v Wade) revealed on her deathbed that she was paid by right-wing operatives to flip her stance on reproductive rights,\" AOC tweeted Tuesday. \"So, like many right-wing operations, it turns out a huge part of the anti-choice movement was a scam the entire time.\" Fox News reached out\u00a0to Adrienne D'Amato, who serves as FX's director of media relations, about the assertions made by King and Pavone and she provided a statement from director Nick Sweeney. \"Norma willingly participated in the making of this film. This was, in her words, her 'deathbed confession.' Her words were not taken out of context or manipulated in any way,\" he wrote. \"Others in the film, including Rev. Rob Schenck, confirm her story. As is standard practice, we licensed the rights to personal photos from Norma for a nominal fee (a few dozen photos at $50 per photo).\" He added, \"My only goal with the film was to let Norma tell her own story. I hope those who watch it will see that we don't shy away from the complexities and contradictions that made Norma who she was.\" Pavone replied to Sweeney's statement, saying, \"We know all that already, and we still know her better. Every time she took part in a film project she came to me frequently. She always insisted on reviewing the final product. Did she get to review this one? She obviously didn't because of her death. I don't think he got her signoff on that.\" Fox News' Louis Casiano\u00a0contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Biden gets polling boost after first debate; Charlie Hurt and Harold Ford Jr. join 'The Daily Briefing' to discuss The upcoming vice-presidential debate will be dramatically different than the first presidential debate. The first presidential debate was a fast-moving clash of personalities \u2013 with a lot of clutter and confusion. The vice-presidential debate can move more slowly and be more informative in clarifying the difference between the two tickets. The contrast between Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s Indiana conservatism and Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s San Francisco radicalism is so great that this should be a debate focused on issues far more than personalities. The stage is set for a truly historic encounter. LIZ PEEK: 2020 VP DEBATE \u2013 WHY THIS ONE MATTERS MORE THAN MOST Vice President Pence believes in the historic America of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and American history. Sen. Harris is allied with the radicals who want to dramatically change America and who repudiate the Founding Fathers and the basic events which created America. Harris\u2019s radicalism was obvious when she said to Steven Colbert about the demonstrations and riots: \u201cThey're not going to stop \u2026 this is a movement. I'm telling you, \u2026 they're not going to stop before election day in November, and they're not gonna stop after election day. And that should be -- everyone should take note of that on both levels -- that this isn't \u2013 they're not going to let up and they should not. And we should not.\u201d When the Los Angeles mayor cut $150 million from the city police budget Harris said, \u201cI applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done.\u201d By contrast, Vice President Pence strongly favors supporting police and locking up criminals. He has worked with President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr on Operation LeGend and other federal efforts to arrest and prosecute violent criminals. Meanwhile, Harris supports efforts to get criminals out of jail. In June, Harris advocated for the public to fund bail for arrested suspects implicated in the George Floyd riots in Minneapolis. \"If you\u2019re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,\" Harris tweeted. Vice President Pence favors prosecutors who enforce the law. Sen. Harris supports George Soros-funded district attorneys who are pro-criminal and anti-police. When she was asked about her support for convicted felons and other prisoners voting from jail \u2013 and whether that would include the Boston Marathon Bomber while he is on appeal from his death sentence \u2013 she refused to rule it out, saying, \u201cI think we should have that conversation.\u201d Vice President Pence is strongly pro-life while Sen. Harris is committed to repealing the Hyde Amendment which protects taxpayers from having to pay for abortion. She would support tax paid abortions \u2013 and it is not clear if that would include in the ninth month as many Democrats advocate. Vice President Pence is a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and the Second Amendment. Sen. Harris has a robust plan for dramatically limiting the right to own guns. Vice President Pence strongly supports constitutional conservative judicial nominees for federal courts and has supported all three of President Trump\u2019s pro-constitution nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court. Sen. Harris was the most vicious questioner of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. She has opposed all three conservative nominees. She and Vice President Joe Biden refuse to issue a list of the kind of justices they would appoint to the Supreme Court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Parallel to their opposite positions on judges, Vice President Pence believes in protecting our religious liberties under the First Amendment while Sen. Harris would sue nuns for not supporting a pro-abortion agenda. Harris\u2019 hostility to Catholics came out when she challenged one court nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus. She implied that if he was a faithful Catholic, he couldn\u2019t serve on the Court. She is simply the most bigoted anti-Catholic nominee of a major party since the late 19th century. Vice President Pence supports school choice and parents\u2019 right to send their children to a good school. Sen. Harris is deeply opposed to school choice and favors a teachers\u2019 union run bureaucratic school monopoly. Vice President Pence is a strong supporter of hydraulic fracturing, which has given America energy independence, created millions of jobs, and lowered the cost of energy. Sen. Harris on CNN said \u201cThere's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking, so yes. And starting -- and starting with what we can do on day one around public lands, right? And then there has to be legislation, but yes -- and this is something I've taken on in California. I have a history of working on this issue. And to your point, we have to just acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the impact on the health and safety of communities.\u201d Finally, where Vice President Pence is for enforcing our immigration laws, Sen. Harris is for eliminating criminal charges for entering the United States without permission. As she put it on CNN after one of the Democratic primary debates, \u201cit should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal enforcement issue.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Furthermore, she would provide government health care and free education for all immigrants in the country illegally, asserting \u201cI'm opposed to any policy that would deny in our country, any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health period.\u201d The gap between the conservative vice president and the radical senator from San Francisco is so great this could be a tremendously powerful clash of ideas and policies.

And unlike the DNC -- well, this convention won't be ignored and it won't ignore the safety and security and violence going on in American cities all around the country. And, by the way, but, first, I want to go right to this video that starts about the economy and we will be carrying as much as we can let's go live to this video. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Able to shed light on an area that had been so long left behind. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was huge, especially for a community like ours that has a lot of small businesses, manufacturing, deregulation, fair trade. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Real life policy changes that affected real Americans. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An amazing opportunity to get ahead, to have our businesses, to have our children educated. School choice. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That is something that's huge for parents right now, especially black moms whose kids are trapped in failing school districts. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Before COVID hit, black unemployment rate was at lowest ever. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've seen the numbers of employees go up and they're earning a lot more for their family than they have previously. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What this administration has done simplifying the government that's really cut the handcuffs off of America again and allowed us to grow and move forward in a way that I have never seen in my lifetime. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you pull regulation and allow smart companies to go out there and be able to play in the game, that is the American Dream. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People feel that they can support and have a family and it can build and make us stronger as Americans. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What could be taken away if he doesn't win again? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Biden said the first thing is he going to do is increase taxes on everyone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Overregulating and making it where small business can't grow. That's taking away the American dream. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think with the upcoming election, people just need to think about what is better for them and their family. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president's job is to be the CEO of our country. And he is doing his job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has improved jobs. He has improved health. He has improved wages. He's cut taxes. I could go on for an hour and a half. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The plan is working. Everybody had a job. Making money, spending money. Boom. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My kids are going to look up to me and say you are the best mom for working, raising us, it's just tremendous what I could do, I guess. This is somebody who loves his country. He is truly fighting for the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE) LARRY KUDLOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER: Hello, folks. You know me from TV and radio. I'm Larry Kudlow. Years ago, I worked for Ronald Reagan. More recently, I helped the team craft Donald Trump's economic plan during the campaign. It was a roaring success, inheriting a stagnant economy on the front end of recession, the program of tax cuts, historic roll back of onerous regulations that crippled small business, unleashing energy to become the world's number one producer, and free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to bolster manufacturing, agriculture, technology and other sectors. The economy was rebuilt in three years. Unemployment fell to the lowest rate of 3.5 percent. Blue collars, African-Americans, Hispanics, women, all groups benefited enormously. Everyone was better off, a rising tide lifted all boats. Then, came a once in 100-year pandemic. It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic. Hardship and heartbreak were everywhere. But, presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively, with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus. The great bipartisan rescue also saved the economy. Right now, our economic health is coming back with emergency spending and tax cuts, Americans are going back to work. There's a housing boom. There's an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom. Stocks are in record territory. A V-shaped recovery is pointing to better than 20 percent growth in the second half of this year. Now, looking ahead, more tax cuts and payroll tax cuts and regulatory rollback will be in store. Payroll tax cuts for higher wages. Income tax cuts for the middle class. Capital gains tax cuts for investments, productivity and jobs, much more regulatory relief for small businesses. In economic terms, folks, this is no time for a $4 trillion tax hike. Coming out of the deep pandemic, who in their right mind would pick the pockets of taxpayers and drain money from their wallets and purses? Look, our economic choice is very clear, do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity and optimism? Or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism. I believe there can't be better economic policies than we've had in recent years. So, I say stay with them. Thank you. JOHN PETERSON, CEO OF SCHUETTE METALS: I'm John Peterson, owner of a second generation metal fabrication business called Schuette Metals. We've been stamping our products and services \"Made in the USA\" since 1957. My brother and I purchased the business from my uncles almost 38 years ago. What was a 12-person shop has grown into a company employing 165 people today. Like most companies that are successful over the long run, we had to reinvent ourselves as the market changed. Six years ago, we invested heavily in our business just as the great recession appeared. Barack Obama and Joe Biden -- two career politicians who know nothing about business -- couldn't get the government out of our way. And it put our business in a tailspin. Sadly, we were forced to make decisions which included cutting staff -- a torturous experience when your employees are like family. The Obama/Biden era banking regulations left us no choice. It tied our lender's hands, and deprived us of the lifeblood of our business: capital. We scratched and we clawed for two years, and then everything changed. Donald Trump was elected president. He knew what it was like to build a company and create jobs. One of the first things he did was to cut the red tape and put an end to draconian banking regulations. He also cut taxes on small businesses, allowing us to be more competitive both domestically and internationally. In fact, we increased revenues by 25 percent, for two years in a row. By getting rid of the job-killing NAFTA and negotiating the US-Mexico- Canada trade agreement, President Trump ensured a more competitive playing field for American companies. Even with all the challenges presented by the coronavirus, President Trump is re-building, and our economy is roaring back again. But when I hear that Joe Biden is ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations and weaken our international trade position, I shudder. We simply cannot endure a Biden-induced recession. Some will struggle, some will not survive. And working men and women of America will get crushed yet again. This is not the time to hand our government over to a washed-up career politician who will be nothing but a puppet of the radical left Democrats. As a life-long resident of Wisconsin, I'm a fan of Wisconsin Badger football. Many might not realize that the Wisconsin Badgers and the President share three common qualities. They are smart, they're tough and they're dependable. As a businessman, I can tell you those are qualities we need in our country's leader and that's why we need to re-elect President Donald J. Trump. Thank you and God bless America. (MUSIC) CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH, CHRISTIAN LEADER: Good evening, I'm Cissie Graham Lynch. And I'm honored to speak to you tonight about something that is so important to all of us: our faith. As Americans, we know that the first line of the First Amendment protects our freedom of religion. But what we often forget the actual words are \"free exercise\" of religion. That means living out our faith in our daily lives -- in our schools, in our jobs, and yes, even in the public square. Our Founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied. But during the Obama-Biden Administration, these freedoms were under attack. Democrats tried to make faith organizations pay for abortion-inducing drugs. Democrats tried to force adoption agencies to violate their deeply held beliefs. Democrats pressured schools to allow boys to compete in girls' sports and use girls' locker rooms. Those are the facts. But then We the People elected Donald Trump, people of faith suddenly had a fierce advocate in the White House. He appointed judges who respect the First Amendment. He supported religious beliefs in court. He ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs. He withdrew the policies that placed our little girls at risk. And on the world stage, President Trump became the first president to talk about the importance of religious freedom at the United Nations, giving hope to people of faith around the world. In America, we have not yet experienced physical persecution, even though the left has tried to silence us. Even during the pandemic, we saw how quickly life could change. Some Democrat leaders tried to ban church services while marijuana shops and abortion clinics were declared \"essential.\" But, you know what is truly essential? Our right to worship freely and live our faith in every aspect of life. The Biden-Harris vision for America leaves no room for people of faith. Whether you're a baker, a florist, or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God, or to Caesar, because the radical left's god is government power. So in the words of my grandfather, Billy Graham: Let us stand for political freedom, moral freedom, religious freedom and the rights of all Americans, and let's never give in to those who would attempt to take it from us. Tonight, I'm proudly standing in that public square. And I hope and pray you will join me in voting to re-elect President Trump. ROBERT VLAISALJEVICH, MAYOR OF EVELETH, MINNESOTA: I am Bob Vlaisaljevich, mayor of Eveleth, a small town in the Iron Range of Minnesota. My father and grandfather earned their livings mining the raw materials that made the steel that built America. This election is a make-or-break for workers who are carrying on the legacy of men like them. Since the Iron Range economy is vulnerable to economic trends and to foreign trade, we have always needed a strong voice in Washington. We look to Democrats to fill that void for many years because we actually thought they cared about our welfare. Not anymore. The radical environmental movement has dragged the Democratic Party so far to the Left that they can no longer claim to be advocates of the working men. This is hard for me to say because I am a life-long Democrat. But for far too long, members of both parties allowed our country to be ripped off by our trading partners, especially China, who dumped steel into our markets and slapped tariffs on our products. And what did so-called leaders like Joe Biden do? Nothing. The human cost has been devastating. We lost thousands of jobs. We lost a generation of young people who had to move out of the area to find a livelihood. And worst of all, we lost hope. And something unexpected happen. A street- talking New Yorker burst onto the scene, promising to stand up to China and the rest of the world on behalf of the American worker. Four years later, the Iron Range is roaring back to life and we have one man to thank, President Donald Trump. He made good on his promises by cutting our taxes, rolling back senseless regulations and delivering trade deals that put America's interest first. But the fight is not over. Joe Biden has allowed radicals like AOC to craft his environmental policies. Their so-called Green New Deal is job-killing disgrace dreamt up by people who don't live in the real world. But Biden is too weak, too scared and too sleep y to stand up to the radical left. He has been doing nothing in Washington for 47 years. What would year 48 be any different? Donald Trump won't back down to anybody. He delivered the best economy in our history and he will do it again for all of us. This Iron Range's economic future and survival is at stake, and so is America's. We know we can count on President Trump to fight for us and win. Let's make sure he wins on November 3rd. God bless America. (MUSIC) ABBY JOHNSON, PRO-LIFE ADVOCATE: My name is Abby Johnson. And I spent eight years working for Planned Parenthood. But today, I'm a pro-life activist. When I was in college, Planned Parenthood approached me at a volunteer fair. They talked about helping women in crisis and their commitment to keep abortion \"safe, legal and rare.\" I was convinced to volunteer and later offered a full-time job as a medical assistant before my promotion to director of the clinic. I truly believed I was helping women. But things drastically changed in 2009. In April, I was awarded Planned Parenthood's Employee of the Year award and invited to their annual gala where they present the Margaret Sanger Award, named for their founder. And Margaret Sanger was a racist who believed in eugenics. Her goal when founding Planned Parenthood was to eradicate the minority population. Today, almost 80 percent of Planned Parenthood abortion facilities are strategically located in minority neighborhoods; And every year, Planned Parenthood celebrates its racist roots by presenting the Margaret Sanger award. Later, in August, my supervisor assigned me a new quota to meet. I was expected to sell double the abortions performed the previous year. When I pushed back, underscoring Planned Parenthood's public-facing goal of decreasing abortions, I was reprimanded, and told: Abortion is how we make our money. But the tipping point came a month later, when a physician asked me to assist with an ultrasound-guided abortion. Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen - an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction. And I'll never forget what the doctor said next: Beam me up, Scotty. The last thing I saw was a spine twirling around in the mother's womb before succumbing to the force of the suction. On October 6th, I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life. I founded and currently run And Then There Were None, a non-profit organization that's helped nearly 600 abortion workers transition out of the industry. For most people who consider themselves pro-life, abortion is abstract. They can't even conceive of the barbarity. They don't know about the products of conception room in abortion clinics, where infant corpses are pieced back together to ensure nothing remains in the mothers' wombs, or that we joked and called it the \"pieces of children\" room. You see, for me, abortion's real. I know what it sounds like. I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even have a smell? I've been the perpetrator, to these babies, to these women. And I now support President Trump because he's done more for the unborn than any other president. During his first month in office, he banned federal funds for global health groups that promote abortion. That same year, he overturned an Obama-Biden rule that allowed government subsidy of abortion. He appointed a record number of pro-life judges, including two Supreme Court justices. And importantly, he announced a new rule protecting the rights of healthcare workers objecting to abortion, many of whom I work with every day. Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans. This election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we have ever had. That's something that should compel you to action. Go door-to-door, make calls, talk to your neighbors and friends. And vote on November 3rd. Take action that re-elects our president, and do it with our most vulnerable Americans in mind -- the ones who haven't been born yet. (MUSIC) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It began as a class trip to join thousands for the annual March for Life. These Catholic young men traveled from Kentucky to stand up for what they believed in. But what happened was something very different. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Crackers with Make America Great hat on. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You little dirty (EXPLETIVE DELETED) crackers your day is coming. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Young Klansmen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at that Make America Great Again hat. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Social media, the news, and even celebrities launched a campaign of persecution that was completely false, against a boy in a Make America Great Again hats. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The MAGA hat carries a certain connotation that provokes a conditioned reaction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I blame that (EXPLETIVE DELETED) kid. What a little prick. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everyone that sees that smug look wants to punch that kid. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nicholas Sandmann received death threats and his school was forced to close. Tonight, Nicholas tells his story. (END VIDEOTAPE) NICHOLAS SANDMANN, COVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE ATTACKED BY THE MEDIA: Good evening, everyone. My name is Nick Sandmann. I'm the teenager who was defamed by the media after an encounter with a group of protestors on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial last year. Before I begin, I'd like to thank President Trump for the opportunity to share some of my story and why it matters so much to this November's election. In January 2019, I attended the March for Life in Washington D.C. where I demonstrated in defense of the unborn. Later that day, I bought a \"Make America Great Again\" hat because our president, Donald Trump, has distinguished himself as the most pro-life presidents in the history of our country and I wanted to express my support for him too. Looking back now, how could I possibly have imagined that the simple act of putting on that red hat would unleash the hate from the left and make myself the target of network and cable news networks, nationwide? Being from Kentucky, the birth place of Abraham Lincoln, my classmates and I visited the Lincoln Memorial. I found myself face-to-face with Nathan Phillips and other professional protestors looking to turn me into the latest poster child showing why Trump is bad. While the media portrayed me as the aggressor with a \"relentless smirk\" on my face, in reality the video confirms I was standing with my hands behind my back and an awkward smile on my face that hid two thoughts. One, don't do anything that might further agitate the man banging a drum in my face and two, trying to follow a family friend's advice never to do anything to embarrass your family, your school, or your community. Before I knew what was happening, it was over. One of Mr. Phillips fellow agitators yelled out \"We got him!\", \"It's all right here on video\" and \"We won Grandpa\". What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage. My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode. They did so without ever researching the full video of the incident; without ever investigating Mr. Philips' motives; or without ever asking me for my side of the story. And do you know why? Because the truth was not important. Advancing their anti-Christian, anti-Conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered. And if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of a teenager from Covington, Kentucky, well, so be it. That will teach him not to wear a MAGA hat. I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled, as in annulled, as in revoked, as in made void. Cancelled is what's happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left. Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I wouldn't be cancelled. I fought back hard to expose the media for what they did to me and I won a personal victory. While much more must be done, I look forward to the day that the media returns to providing balanced, responsible and accountable news coverage. I know President Trump hopes for that too. And I know you'll agree with me when we say that no one in this county has been a victim of unfair media coverage more than President Donald Trump. In November, I believe this country must unite around a president who calls the media out and refuses to allow them to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts. I believe we must join with a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism. And together, I believe we must all embrace our First Amendment rights and not hide in fear of the media, or from the tech companies or the outrage mob either. This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. And this is what President Donald Trump stands for. Thank you all for listening to me tonight. And one more thing -- let's Make America Great Again. HANNITY: Wow, powerful moment. Nicholas Sandmann speaking at this night two of the RNC. We're in the Rose Garden, media mob, you did you that to an innocent person. You did that. Fake news CNN, you paid. Others have paid. NBC and others, next. He did nothing wrong. Totally smeared, slandered besmirched by the hate Trump media mob for wearing a MAGA hat. We're live in the Rose Garden awaiting the remarks of the first lady and others. Back to night two of the Republican National Convention and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. PAM BONDI (R), FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: As a career prosecutor and former attorney general of Florida, I fought corruption and I know what it looks like, whether it's done by people wearing pinstriped suits or orange jump suits. At the Democrats' convention, we were told to look at Joe Biden as the model of integrity, but when you look at his 47-year career in politics, the people who benefited are his family members. Not the American people. Let's take a closer look. We all know about Joe's son Hunter Biden, a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch put Hunter on the board of his company, even though he had no experience in Ukraine or in energy sector, none. Yet he was paid to do nothing. He only had one qualification that mattered, he was the son of the man in charge of distributing U.S. aid to Ukraine. And recently reported information revealed that a few months after Hunter Biden joined that corrupt company's board, the Obama-Biden's State Department began doing business with them, even when it remained under investigation for corruption. And it gets worse. That very same company was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor. Joe Biden, the vice president of the United States, threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless that same prosecutor was fired. And then, he was fired. Hunter only resigned from that board just before his dad announced his campaign for president. Now, let's talk about China. Fact: Joe Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with Hunter along for the ride. They said he was just there as a family member, but we know that's untrue. In Beijing, Hunter didn't just go sight- seeing, he had meetings with his Chinese bank partners. Hunter even arranged for his dad to meet with one of the partners. Ten days later, those Chinese communist bankers approved millions to go to Hunter's firm. And those bankers work for the Chinese Communist Party which oppresses their people, cheated American workers for decades and covered up a deadly virus. To this day, Hunter controls a 10 percent stake in that firm. And Joe Biden has done more than look the other way on China. He said the Chinese aren't our competition. Come on, man. They are not bad folks. Come on, Joe. Talk to the folks in Middle America who lost countless jobs to China while your son was getting rich with them. But there's more. Fact: there have been numerous press reports that have shown other close Biden family members benefited from Joe's 47-year political career. Joe Biden was point person on Iraq. The president of a construction firm met with Biden's team in the White House and then who did they hire to build thousands of houses in Iraq? Joe Biden's close family member. Who, you guessed it, had no experience in the industry and no experience in Iraq. A company official bragged that it helps to have a family member the vice president partner. The family member put it more bluntly by saying there is a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest. Now, let's follow the money down south. Again, as reported in the press, yet another close family member of Joe's set his sights on Costa Rica and Jamaica, where millions of dollars flowed from the Obama-Biden administration in taxpayer-backed loans to projects linked, to yes, that same family member. These aren't isolated incidents. It is a deliberate pattern of conduct. And that's just what he did as vice president. Imagine what he'd do as president. How many American families would be allowed to get away with this? Why should there be one standard for the elite political class and another set of rules for the rest of us? When millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump, they knew he would be different, and he is. He is a tough, no- nonsense outsider who can't be bought or intimidated. He won't even take a paycheck from the American people. He donates his paycheck to charities across this country. Democrats have been lecturing America about integrity for four years while their nominee has been writing the textbook on abuse of power for 40 years. If they want to make this election a choice between who is saving America and who is swindling America? Bring it on. Joe says he will build back better, yeah, build the Bidens back better. Our president is in this to build a safer, better, and stronger America and he will finish what he started to keep this a real land of opportunity for everyone.

(MUSIC) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Women have played a very, very big role, at the level of geniuses, unbelievable, frankly. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You, what, you got 70, 80 years on this earth, what are you going to do with it? Are you going to make that difference? Are you going to say I was there for the big battles in our country to save America? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's what I feel very much called to do ever since I was a very young girl. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In 2016, Donald Trump made his historic run for the office of United States president, knowing the monumental task he would be undertaking, he rested all of his hopes for winning on one woman. Because of that trust, he became the 45th president of the United States and Kellyanne Conway became the first woman in U.S. history to manage a winning presidential campaign. KELLYANNE CONWAY, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR TRUMP: This president has been a champion for women mostly because he speaks to them as if they can handle and tackle all issues. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISER, TRUMP 2020: I don't want a job because of my gender. I want the job because I'm the best person for that position. That's it. And he respects that. And he appreciates hard work. You can't ask for anything better, especially in a boss. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump continues to place strong women into significant positions throughout his administration and campaign, far more than any other president in U.S. history. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That he has had -- does have more women on his top team than any president before but it actually goes down to his deputy assistants, to his special assistants, to our awesome teams throughout the West Wing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And when he called me and said, I want to you represent my entire campaign, I became the first black woman to represent a Republican presidential campaign, winning presidential campaign in United States history. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Throughout his career Trump has always touted family first as a core value. He shows this especially with his choices of press secretaries, choosing Sarah Sanders the first mother to become a press secretary. Stephanie Grisham, the first single mother to serve as press secretary, and Kayleigh McEnany, who transitioned into the job while also transitioning in the job of mom. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have four children, Kellyanne Conway has four children. I think between all the senior staff women, we might have 75 kids. I'm not sure we have lost count. But the importance of the work is never lost on any of us. And truly it is those children we are fighting for and for their future. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With these capable women placed in positions of powerful influence and authority, President Trump has proven that when the stakes are highest, he is proud to entrust many of our nation's most crucial jobs to women. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The number of dedicated, amazing, brilliant, relentless women that are dedicate to the country and to the president and to preserving the American dream is one of the greatest, if not the greatest things I will ever be a part of. RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, RNC: Only the president would say, let's take that stay-at-home mom and have her run the party. What a smart guy. (END VIDEOTAPE) TIFFANY TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Good evening. I'm Tiffany Trump. Since speaking at the Republican Convention four years ago, so much has changed for the world, for our country and for my family. Like so many students across the world, I graduated from law school during the pandemic. Our generation is unified in the facing the future in uncertain times. And many of us are considering what kind of country we want to live in. As a recent graduate, I can relate to so many of you who might be looking for a job. My father built a thriving economy once, and, believe me, he will do it again. This election, I urge each and every one of you to transcend political boundaries. This is a fight for freedom versus oppression, for opportunity versus stagnation, a fight to keep America true to America. I urge you to make judgment based on results and not rhetoric. If you believe in criminal justice reform, there is only one president that passed the First Step act, giving people a second chance, a chance at a life once again. And if you believe in expanding quality and affordable healthcare, only President Trump, my father, signed the Right to Try into law, the favored nations clause and other actions to lower drug prices and keep Americans from getting ripped off. People must recognize that our thoughts, our opinions and even the choice of who we are voting for may and are being manipulated and visibly coerced by the media and tech giants. If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another. And what you share, if it does not fit into the narrative that they seek to promote, then it is either ignored or deemed a lie, regardless of the truth. This manipulation of what information we receive impedes our freedoms. Rather than allowing Americans the right to form our own beliefs, this misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct. This has fostered unnecessary fear and divisiveness amongst us. Why are so many in media and technology and even in our own government so invested in promoting a biased and fabricated view? Ask yourselves why are we prevented from seeing certain information? Why is one viewpoint promoted while others are hidden? The answer is control, because division and controversy breed profit. But what are the consequences when only one side of a story gets out or when only one viewpoint is acceptable? For our education system, it meant sacrificing civil debate by creating an atmosphere where students with contrary opinions are too afraid to speak. Many students find themselves suppressed in their beliefs to fit into what the acceptable groupthink is. In short. our nation suffers by inhibiting our diversity of thought and inclusion of ideas. Working together outside of our political comfort zones, we'll accomplish so much more. Some cynical politicians do not seem to believe in the miracle of America. Well, I do. As Maximo Alvarez said so eloquently last night, if freedom is lost in this country, there is nowhere else to go. Having hope is not weakness. And believing in miracles is a gift from God. So tonight, I want to tell you the uncensored truth of what we believe in. We believe in equality of opportunity. We believe in freedom of thought and expression. Think what you want. Seek out the truth. Learn from those with different opinions. And then freely make your voice heard to the world. We believe in school choice, because a child's zip code in America should not determine their future. We believe in freedom of religion for all faiths. And we believe in the American spirit, a country founded on ideas, not identity, a country where our differences are embraced, and the only country where the word \"dream\" has been attached to it. Because, in America, your life is yours to chart. So if you're hearing these things and thinking to yourself, \"That is the kind of country that I want to live in,\" well, whether you realize it or not, you are a Trump supporter. I encourage you to see beyond the facade that so many other politicians employ. They mask themselves in disguises of decency, as they try to pressure us to mask our own identities and beliefs. My father is the only person to challenge the establishment, the entrenched bureaucracy, big pharma and media monopolies, to ensure that Americans' constitutional freedoms are upheld and that justice and truth prevail. My father does not run away from challenges, even in in the face of outright hatred. Because fighting for America is something he will sacrifice anything for. He dreams big dreams for our country. And he is relentless at achieving them. You see, \"Make America great again\" is not a slogan for my father. It is what drives him to keep his promise of doing what is right for American citizens. The energy of change and opportunity is with us. God has blessed us with unstoppable spirit, His spirit, the American spirit. My dad has proven to be driven by that spirit. He has demonstrated his faith in his uncompromising heart and actions. My father has made me believe that America can truly be great again. If you care about living your life without restraints, about rebelling against those who would suppress your voice, and building your American dream, then the choice in this election is clear. A vote for my father, Donald J. Trump, is a vote to uphold our American ideals. Be true to yourself, and stay true to the dream of America. Thank you, and God bless you all. HANNITY: Wow, powerful comments President Trump's daughter Tiffany Trump. What a difference from a week ago radical socialist convention versus American goodness, greatness, American exceptionalism. In just a few moments, First Lady Melania Trump will address the RNC on night two from the Rose Garden which is where we are broadcasting from tonight. Also, Vice President Pence will make an appearance at the convention tonight. We are awaiting speeches from Eric Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But let's get back to night two, RNC convention, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds now speaking. GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA): -- grateful for the freedoms it provides. As I like to say, Iowa is one big, small town. Neighbor helping neighbor is in our DNA. From the sick farmer who can't harvest his crops to the single mom who loses her job and is struggling to get back on her feet, the town - - the community -- helps them get through it. But what happens when a storm rips through almost the entire state? When it's not one farmer who lost his crop but hundreds. When it's not one neighbor who is without food, but thousands. That happened, just two weeks ago. A storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops, left thousands without power. It destroyed homes, wrecked lives, and left devastation in its wake. It was the worst storm in our state's history. And Iowans did what you expect Iowans to do. They helped each other. They took care of each other. And they still are. But someone else also had our back: Our president. When the winds had finished raging and the cleanup had only begun, he showed up. Now, you might not know, because the national media didn't report it. But the Trump administration was here in full force. The day after the storm, the president called to assure me that we had the full backing of the federal government. And later that week, Vice President Pence came to Iowa to again assure us that the President and his administration were behind us. With the help of the Trump Administration, we quickly received a disaster declaration that will help Iowans get back on their feet. The president, he cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly. But that's not the first time President Trump showed Iowans that we can rely on him. In 2019, when 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities large and small along the Missouri River, in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri, the president approved our request for aid in record time -- in just two days. Well, this year, he did it in less than 24 hours. So, whether it's providing needed relief to farmers who were the target of China's unfair trade practices, hammering out new free and fair trade deals, or fighting for workers and small businesses who were hit hard by COVID-19, we have a President and an Administration who gets things done. And because of President Trump and his leadership, our county is able to bounce back from setbacks, and see opportunity grow and thrive. This is an administration of action and outcomes. They are delivering every day on their promise to make America great again. And that's exactly why we need to re-elect President Donald J. Trump in November. Thank you. And may God bless the United States of America. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: America, the land of opportunity, a country where your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other. Abraham Lincoln's words from 165 years ago still resonate today because of who we are and because of what we are, a country where a boy born into poverty in a log cabin raised right here on the frontier of Indiana could educate himself, become a lawyer, become a president of the United States who would preserve the union, abolish slavery and save the nation. As a fellow Hoosier, visiting Lincoln's boyhood home has always been a treasured experience for me and my family. It's a place that made Lincoln. It shaped Lincoln, and defined the man that Lincoln would become. America is the land of opportunity. As President Donald Trump declared at Mount Rushmore, in America, you can do anything. You can be anything. And together, we can achieve anything. Every day, President Donald Trump is fighting to protect the promise of American liberty. Every day, our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. And on every single day, without fail, President Donald Trump has been fighting for you. So tonight, I'd like to introduce you to a few remarkable Americans who represent that solemn pledge, who embody our president's unbreakable devotion to ensuring that America is a land of unlimited opportunity for all. Jack is an 8-year-old from Wisconsin, who was struggling academically and socially in school. Jack's mom, Sarah, who works three jobs to support her son applied for Wisconsin's school choice voucher program. SARAH HUGHES, MOM: We are glad that we were able to get the school choice voucher to go to that school. With Jack, he would have slipped through the cracks in public school and having the option to go to a school that fits him has been a real game changer for us, and I know that because of that opportunity that he is going to succeed and he is going to achieve that goal of being an apparatus engineer if that's what he chooses to stick with. PENCE: Laura McLinn is the mother of another boy, Jordan. Jordan has Duchene muscular dystrophy, a fatal muscle weakening disorder. Jordan was my side in Indiana when as governor I signed a law allowing terminally ill patients to access experimental drugs not yet approved by the FDA. In 2018, President Trump signed the landmark federal right-to-try bill into law. Thanks to the president's leadership, critically ill patients have the right to access life-saving experimental treatments. LAURA MCLINN, MOM: We started fighting for right-to-try which basically says if you have a terminal illness and there is a drug that exists and you don't qualify for the clinical trial, there is no way to receive it, this is a unique pathway that allows to you have access. He made us a promise back in Indiana that you would do whatever it took to help Jordan and we're so grateful that you joined us on this journey and stuck it out until it became law so other people could access treatment. PENCE: So, Jordan, if President Trump was standing right there, what would you say to him today about right-to-try? JORDAN MCLINN: Thank you for being a hero to everybody in the country. PENCE: Judge Cheryl Allen made history in 2007 when she became the first African-American woman to be elected to serve on the Pennsylvania's superior court. It's because of leaders like Judge Allen that our nation has overcome our greatest challenges. In this time of racial division in the country, do you see faith and values -- CHERYL ALLEN, JUDGE: Absolutely. PENCE: And the strong stand that President Trump has taken for equality of opportunity, as a pathway towards bringing the country together? ALLEN: As a senior citizenship, I will leave it at that, I know what racism feels like. But I also know that but for my being in this country, I would have never been able to achieve the things that I have been able to achieve. There are injustices, but the way to deal with those injustices is for people to sit down across the table and talk and come up with solutions. I do believe that President Trump is committed to that. In 2016, I have to confess that I really did not know candidate Trump at the time. But I have to say that he really won me over. PENCE: Geno is a truck driver from Ohio who heard politicians for years make empty promises about defending American jobs only to see those promises broken, again and again. But in 2019 when General Motors closed its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, President Donald Trump refused to stand by and watch it happen. And as Geno observed, this president reached out to General Motors to find a way to bring jobs back to Lordstown. And plans were soon set into motion to create Lordstown Motors. GENO DIFABIO, TRUCK DRIVER: President Trump says this is how we fix it, and I thought well, that's a simple solution. There is no other private -- no one tried to do it. President Trump is a doer. He appreciates every one of us and I know he does. I have seen it. When he said make America great again, that was his task. That wasn't his slogan. That was his task. Every hat you see that says MAGA on it, that's what your president is doing for you. Thank you, Mr. President, for keeping the promises that you made. PENCE: And then there is Pastor Aaron Johnson. Today, he is the executive director of the Tulsa Dream Center a nonprofit that provides education and medical services and food to those in need. A.J., you've got a great personal story when you see the way this president and administration have been leaning in to create opportunities, investments in communities around the country to create jobs, expanding education choice. What does that mean to the families that you serve every day? AARON JOHNSON, PASTOR: It means so much to our families. I did grow up in a single patient home, so we serve over 600 boys and girls right now on a daily basis even in COVID. And so, for us, to give these moms to have an opportunity to take more money on their paycheck home back to them to have their children be able to go to a school that they may not have the opportunity to otherwise, it means so much to us. There's been so much greater opportunity for individuals to come together in any walk of life. People have been able to see such a positive change and been filled with hope, especially throughout this time. PENCE: Lidia left heart and home, friends and family in Honduras to pursue a better life in America. While raising their four daughters, Lidia and her husband run a small business that creates security systems. But just months after their business was up and running, our nation was struck by a global pandemic. That's when President Donald Trump stepped in, and enacted the largest financial relief package in American history. Her small business stayed in business. And her American dream kept running strong. What did the Paycheck Protection Program mean to your company as the coronavirus struck? LIDIA BRODINE, BUSINESSWOMAN: Yeah. It was a huge, tremendous help in and a big blessing. So, we applied. We were accepted and complete it was so grateful. You can't believe how much relief. We want to continue serving our clients. We want to continue to growing our economy, right? We want to all continue to move forward. So, we are all able to make it. Because of the support of family and friends, the government I tell my children they are born here in the U.S. I tell them you are so blessed to live in America. PENCE: Here at Abraham Lincoln's boyhood home, a young man would grow up to become the first Republican president of the United States. And today, another Republican president is fighting to preserve that same noble legacy of freedom. And President Donald Trump will make certain that the torch of American opportunity illuminates every city, every town and every community in this blessed land. RYAN HOLETS, POLICE OFFICER FROM NEW MEXICO: Hi, I'm Ryan Holets. I'm a police officer from New Mexico. In 2017, I had an encounter that changed my life forever. I had just started my shift and responded to a call for supervisors at a gas station. When I arrived, I saw a man and a woman sitting on a grassy slope. I recognized the telltale signs a needle, a spoon, I knew immediately that they were preparing to inject themselves with heroin. Sadly, this is a common sight for me. I encounter the ravages of addiction every day. But, nothing could prepare me for what I discovered as I approached them. The woman was very pregnant. In my shock, I asked her if she knew that she was harming her baby by doing drugs. She crumbled and burst into tears. Two worlds collided as I knelt down beside her. A police officer and a homeless drug addict brought together by forces outside of our control. As we talked, our humanity distinct from our stations in life was made abundantly clear. Her name was Crystal and in the midst of her suffering, she confided that she loved her unborn baby. She wanted the best for her child. In that moment, I saw her the way that all of you who know and love an addict see them as fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, children, cousins, and friends, as human beings full of value and dignity but robbed of their potential by this disease. When Crystal said that she was looking for a family to adopt her baby, God showed me exactly what I had to do. Without hesitation, I told her that my family would welcome her baby through adoption. Today, our beautiful daughter Hope is a thriving 2-year-old, Crystal is fast approaching three years of recovery. She is a dear friend and a constant inspiration to me and others. I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction and that's why I am enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy. Through his efforts, we're turning the tide on the crisis of addiction. President Trump declared the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency and then secured $6 billion in new federal funding to help Americans fight opioid abuse. He invested an additional $100 billion to stop the opioid crisis in rural America, and in a move that strikes at the root of the problem, he implemented a safer prescribing plan aimed at reducing opioid prescriptions by over a third within three years. This is an effort that stops addiction before it ever gains a hold in someone's life. And it's having an impact. Drug overdose deaths decreased in 2018 for the first time in 30 years. Many of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis are seeing the largest drop in deaths. We are seeing that doctors are writing fewer prescriptions for opioid pain drugs. These are significant improvements that have a meaningful impact. HANNITY: Wow, what a difference a week makes. That was Ryan Holets, a police officer in New Mexico who adopted the child of an opioid addict. So far, night two, major success. Oh, it's not the radical socialists. Well, great Americans speaking about a great country, great exceptionalism, great inspiration. Unlike, what, last week's hateful anti-Trump every second of the DNC -- oh, positive messages about the greatest country God has ever given man. Country that has always striving to be a more perfect union, with the great Constitution we have. Programming note: Tomorrow night, we'll be broadcasting from the historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, where Vice President Mike Pence will address the nation. In moments, First Lady Melania Trump will address the RNC. Stay with our continuing coverage. Bret and Martha followed by Laura Ingraham.

            "article_content": " Give me a stack of Bibles\u00a0so I can swear on them this simple fact: The conversion of Norma McCorvey, the Jane Roe of Roe v Wade, to a pro-life position and to faith in Christ, was no act. The assertions gleefully made by abortion advocates that an upcoming documentary show she was lying are about as believable as someone who would presume to tell you that your sibling or best friend was just pretending to be who they were their whole life. My colleague Janet\u00a0Morana\u00a0and I were privileged to be by Norma\u2019s side for her journey for 22 years, from her baptism in 1995 to the day of her death in 2017 \u2013 a day on which we had our final conversation with her. DR. ALVEDA KING: CLAIM THAT 'JANE ROE' WAS PAID TO JOIN PRO-LIFE CAUSE IS FALSE I received her into the Catholic Church in 1998, as Janet sat next to her. We led her through an intense spiritual and psychological healing process from the wounds she incurred in the abortion industry, had thousands of conversations and spent countless hours both in public and in private, for business and pleasure. The sacrifices Norma made on this journey of healing are not things you can fake. Her life can\u2019t be summarized in an\u00a0article or in an\u00a0interview\u00a0\u2013 even with her.\u00a0One had to see the whole pattern, all the ups and downs, to identify her center of gravity. She was wounded and erratic, and yet knew she was a new creation in Christ; she was needful of help and yet fiercely independent, tender of heart and yet capable of fierce anger and rebellion. I don\u2019t know what the interview was that the documentary is touting, or what was said leading up to it. What I do know is that the conversion and commitment, the agony and the joy I witnessed firsthand for 22 years was not a fake. There is zero percent chance of that. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In 2013, Norma traveled to New York to celebrate with me as I marked the 25th\u00a0anniversary of my ordination.\u00a0On what was one of countless similar occasions, Norma regaled\u00a0a number of us until late in the night with stories from her life. She was a character, funny and flawed. She was a sinner, just like the rest of us. On the day she died, her daughter Melissa \u2013 sensing the end was near \u2013 called Janet and me in Rome and we were able to talk to Norma before she passed. She urged us to continue fighting to overturn the unjust decision made in the name of Jane Roe, the persona she had long since outgrown.\u00a0There was no play-acting in Norma\u2019s final words to us. Everyone will talk about this film\u00a0for a few days but most\u00a0won\u2019t care about the truth.\u00a0There have always been people who have tried to reshape Norma\u2019s\u00a0story, or get her to reshape it. She resented that and would resent it today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If anything, what the other side has to face up to is that Norma rejected abortion\u00a0before\u00a0she became pro-life. The day before the pro-abortion press conference in which she was first revealed as the \u201cRoe\u201d of Roe v Wade, she told Gloria Allred that she thought abortion was wrong. And while working in abortion clinics, she talked women out of their abortions. If there was any ambiguity, it was about her commitment to pro-choice, not to pro-life. Our movement should take this wave of negative publicity as a chance to get to know Norma better, and to urge America to get to know better Roe v Wade, a policy of abortion-on-demand throughout pregnancy \u2013 a policy that not only Norma but America has rejected.

            "article_content": "The nomination hearing amid a national election. The confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, will kick off Monday, where she's expected to be grilled on several hot-button issues that would have\u00a0a far-reaching impact. Supreme Court nominees routinely won't say how they'll rule on particular issues\u00a0to prevent prejudging\u00a0a potential case, but lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee are expected to target her past writings and statements -- and press Barrett on how those past communications might impact her judicial thinking on such issues as abortion, gun ownership, health care and more. Unlike Trump's previous two nominees -- Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who replaced conservative-leaning justices --\u00a0Barrett's ascension to the court would have a big ideological impact because she would succeed liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Sept. 18 at age 87. AMY CONEY BARRETT TO FACE TOUGH QUESTIONING FROM DEMS OVER ABORTION Barrett's addition to the bench would forge a\u00a06-3 conservative majority on a Supreme Court\u00a0that for decades has had a 5-4 conservative edge, which liberals could occasionally upend by attracting a vote from across the ideological divide. Democrats have opposed Barrett because of the timing of nomination -- just weeks before the presidential election -- and because they believe she would vote\u00a0against their political priorities, including the Affordable Care Act and abortion access. Meanwhile, Republicans have touted Barrett's qualifications for the job, her practice of honoring the\u00a0original meaning\u00a0of\u00a0the Constitution, and her judicial likeless to a conservative hero, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Barrett clerked and considers a mentor. Here's a look at the top issues that will be in the spotlight during Barrett's hearing. Judge Amy Coney Barrett speaks after President Donald Trump announced Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. (Associated Press) ABORTION Anti-abortion groups have championed Barrett's nomination, while pro-choice activists have fiercely opposed her -- both believing she could be a vote to overturn or chip away at Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that gave women a legal right to terminate a pregnancy. Barrett, a Roman Catholic, has been actively pro-life in her personal life, signing onto a two-page ad in 2006 to oppose abortion that called Roe v. Wade's legacy \"barbaric\" and declared life\u00a0begins at \"fertilization.\" And in new\u00a0documents disclosed late Friday that\u00a0Barrett turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barrett joined fellow pro-life faculty at the University of Notre Dame in signing a 2013 newspaper advertisement to oppose the \"infamous\" Roe v. Wade ruling and to \"call for the unborn to be protected in law and welcomed in life.\" DETAILS OF AMY CONEY BARRETT'S MONDAY CONFIRMATION HEARING RELEASED As a jurist on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for just under three years,\u00a0Barrett has encountered only a few abortion cases. In one 2018 case,\u00a0the Seventh Circuit affirmed a lower court decision to strike\u00a0down an Indiana law, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, that would have outlawed abortions that were based on the race, sex or disability of the fetus and would require the dignified disposal of human fetal remains. Barrett disagreed and joined with the\u00a0dissent, written by\u00a0Judge Frank Easterbrook, that viewed the\u00a0Indiana statute as \"an anti-eugenics law.\" AMY CONEY BARRETT SIGNED 2006 STATEMENT CALLING TO END 'BARBARIC' ROE V. WADE LEGACY The case went to the Supreme Court which in 2019 issued\u00a0orders\u00a0with mixed results\u00a0-- allowing the\u00a0fetal tissue disposal portion of the Indiana law to take effect but not allowing Indiana to enact the new abortion restrictions on race, sex or disability. While Trump\u00a0has previously pledged he'd appoint only \"pro-life judges,\" the\u00a0White House has insisted\u00a0Barrett would apply the law and not her personal beliefs. \"The president has been clear that he would never ask a judge to prejudge a case,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. \u201cJudge Amy Coney Barrett has on multiple occasions said it is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge\u2019s personal convictions whether they derive from faith or anywhere else in the law.\u201d Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett looks over to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., as they meet with on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020. (Associated Press) HEALTH CARE The Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, will be\u00a0front-and-center\u00a0during Barrett's confirmation hearing because the Supreme Court is slated to hear a challenge to the Obama-era health care law on Nov. 10 in a case known as\u00a0California v. Texas. If Barrett is confirmed before Nov. 3 -- the goal of Senate Republicans -- she could potentially be in place to hear\u00a0the case and determine the survival of the health law that was designed to decrease the number of uninsured people in America, in part, by requiring that almost everyone have insurance. A coalition of red states aims\u00a0to invalidate the ACA on the grounds that this\u00a0individual mandate\u00a0-- which was upheld by the Supreme Court previously as a tax -- is now unconstitutional because Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with not purchasing health insurance. DEMOCRATS RESIGNED THAT AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION IS INEVITABLE: 'WE CAN'T STOP THE OUTCOME' They say this makes it impossible to read the ACA as a tax anymore, so it is now simply an unconstitutional government mandate to purchase a certain product. The Trump administration is backing the red states' position in the lawsuit. Democrats believe Barrett would vote against the Affordable Care Act because her mentor, Scalia,\u00a0did twice before. At\u00a0the White House nominating ceremony Sept. 26, Barrett made a point to say she shares the same philosophy as Scalia that a judge must apply the law as written and not make policy. \"His judicial philosophy is mine too,\" Barrett said. Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John Roberts for joining the liberal wing of the court in the 2012 case NFIB v. Sebelius that\u00a0upheld the Affordable Care Act by a 5-4 decision. She wrote in a 2017 essay that Roberts \u201cpushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\u201d SCHUMER PUTS HEALTH CARE ON FOREFRONT AS DEMS PREPARE TO FIGHT AMY CONEY BARRETT NOMINATION She publicly sided with the dissent, written by Scalia, in another Supreme Court case that upheld ObamaCare, known as King v. Burwell. \"The dissent has the better of the legal argument,\" Barrett said\u00a0in an NPR interview after the\u00a0ruling. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., meets with Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, at the U.S. Capitol, Sept. 30, 2020, in Washington. (Associated Press) GUN RIGHTS Gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America have expressed support for Barrett, while gun control advocates have opposed her nomination, viewing her as an opponent to laws that restrict gun ownership. Unlike health care,\u00a0Barrett does have a record on guns\u00a0from the Seventh Court that has informed her critics and supporters' opinions on how she views infringements on the\u00a0Second Amendment constitutional right to bear arms. WHERE DOES JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT STAND ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT? In the 2019 gun-rights case Kanter v. Barr, Barrett wrote a dissenting opinion that argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony \u2014 in this case, mail fraud \u2014 shouldn\u2019t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun. She said the government had failed to introduce data \"to show that disarming all nonviolent felons substantially advances its interest in keeping the public safe.\" In that same opinion, she also reaffirmed that states can take away voting rights from felons. Barrett wrote that \"the Second Amendment confers an individual right, intimately connected with the natural right of self defense, and not limited to civic participation.\" Democrats wanting stricter gun control legislation in the wake of America's painful history of mass shootings have come out strongly against Barrett based, in part, on this opinion. \u201cAmy Coney Barrett is a radical,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \"She is seeking a position on the Supreme Court to legislate her radical views into existence, and when 90% of Americans want felons to be kept from buying guns, it is unfathomable that we would consider putting somebody on the Court who is going to strike down that restriction.\" President Donald Trump walks along the Colonnade with Judge Amy Coney Barrett after a news conference to announce Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. (Associated Press) But Republicans have praised Barrett as a principled constitutionalist and a brilliant jurist. \"The left's apocalyptic rhetoric will seem extra nutty when Americans hear from Judge Barrett at her confirmation hearings,\" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT Barrett wrote a unanimous three-judge panel decision in 2019 making it easier for men alleged to have committed sexual assaults on campus to challenge the proceedings against them. The case, Doe v. Purdue University, involved a student who had been found guilty of sexual violence by Purdue University's\u00a0disciplinary system, suspended for an academic year and lost out on his ROTC scholarship. The student, known as John Doe, sued and alleged sex discrimination. JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT: 5 THINGS TO KNOW Barrett sided with the male student and questioned how the university came to favor\u00a0the female student, known as Jane Doe. \"In\u00a0a case that boiled down to a 'he said/she said' it is particularly concerning that [the university]\u00a0concluded that Jane was the more credible witness \u2014 in fact, that she was credible at all \u2014 without ever speaking to her\u00a0in person,\" Barrett wrote. She wrote: \"Purdue\u2019s process fell short of what even a high school must provide to a student facing a days-long suspension.\" Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett, meets with Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, not shown, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2020, at the Capitol in Washington. (Associated Press) IMMIGRATION Barrett has handled a few immigration cases on the Seventh Circuit Court, including one where she sided with the Trump administration in a dissent. In June 2020,\u00a0a three-judge panel on the Seventh Circuit upheld an order blocking a new Trump immigration rule from being enforced.\u00a0The so-called \"public charge\" rule allows immigration officials to deny green cards to legal immigrants over their use of public benefits. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP But Barrett dissented in the case, Cook County\u00a0v. Wolf,\u00a0and wrote that while critics have considered the public charge definition \"too harsh,\" the \"same can be said\" of laws passed by Congress. \"Litigation is not the vehicle for resolving policy disputes,\" Barrett wrote. \"Because I think that [the Department of Homeland Security's] definition is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term 'public charge.'\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\" If confirmed, Barrett, 48, would become the fifth woman to earn a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and would cement its conservative tilt.

Sign up\u00a0here.**FIVE KEY COUNTIES TO WATCHLabor Day has long been the traditional kickoff for the fall campaign season, especially in presidential years.Though it may sound odd in this era of goons drunk on toxic tribalism brawling in our city streets and self-interested doomsaying about the imminent death of our glorious old republic, this was once considered something of a time of fun and frivolity.The tradition of \u201ctreating\u201d \u2013 rewarding one\u2019s partisan supporters with free food and\u00a0lots\u00a0of ardent beverages \u2013 added a great deal to the fun. Those pints of Old Crow handed out to coal miners and steelworkers for their votes in the middle of the last century had pedigrees dating back to colonial days. Marching bands, lots to eat and drink\u2026 sounds kind of like a college football tailgate.But what really made things more fun was that quite often both sides were genuinely excited about the future.Think about this: In 1963, as it looked increasingly like Arizona Sen.\u00a0Barry Goldwater\u00a0would capture the Republican nomination the next year, he and his good friend and former Senate colleague, President\u00a0John Kennedy, hatched a plan to campaign together in 1964.Goldwater and Kennedy would barnstorm around the country for a series of speeches and debates\u00a0\u201clike politicians should do,\u201d Goldwater said wistfully after Kennedy was assassinated. \u201cStanding up to state our points, our issues, and then debating each other.\u201dWe will never know what might have been because\u00a0Lyndon Johnson, never content to win when he could win dirty, smeared Goldwater as a lunatic bent on nuclear war and a massive escalation in Vietnam (the same escalation Johnson would undertake).But just imagine, if you can, what it was like in America when people could actually look forward to election season.When one regards our self-absorbed political class and much-abused civic institutions, it may be hard these days to be optimistic about our political system. But our experience has taught us that if you want to find good reason for hope, look less at those who want to be elected and more at the electorate.Bearing that very much in mind, let\u2019s take this day\u2019s labors and devote them to breaking down five counties that may prove decisive this year, or at least offer us some insights on how the race is shaping up.You\u2019ll find below, along with some Labor Day tidbits, a brief look at what\u2019s driving the voters in these key counties and how what we know about them shapes our understanding of the contest as a whole.Please enjoy.

No, not the icky stuff. The \u201cTwo Americas\u201d class-struggle business that once made him the darling of the labor left. And when he mounted his two runs for president, he had places like Bladen County very much in mind as the bottom half of that split. Textile imports and the end of tobacco\u2019s heyday spelled serious trouble for counties like these. Fayetteville and Ft. Bragg lie to its north and Wilmington and the Outer Banks lie to its south. Bladen County is large in size but lightly populated.What\u2019s driving voters -\u00a0While voters here clearly responded to President Trump\u2019s protectionist populism in 2016, just as they had with Barack Obama before him, the coronavirus has meant major headaches here for meatpacker Smithfield and its workers. And like many poor counties, the challenge of reopening schools has been a tough one.What to watch for -\u00a0Though small in population itself, Bladen County looks a lot like much of rural and exurban North Carolina. With a high concentration of working-class White voters, the Trump campaign is hoping to win again on a platform of anti-China policies and outage over urban lawlessness. The Biden campaign is looking to win back some traditional labor Democrats among White voters, but more crucially see massive turnout among Black residents that helped drive back-to-back wins for Obama. Another big issue here is voter fraud. The county was the scene of the most significant voter fraud case in recent memory when a Republican operative was found to have rigged ballots in an effort to deliver a win in the 2018 House election here.What you didn\u2019t know -\u00a0Old timers here will remember stories around the campfire about \u201cthe Beast of Bladenboro\u201d that famously terrorized local farmers over the New Years\u2019 week of 1953 into 1954 \u2013 killing nine dogs and some livestock. Witnesses who saw the beast during or after its attacks described the animal as large, sleek, black and stealthy. Most chillingly, the dogs\u2019 owners said the dead animals had been drained of their blood. The story became a regional sensation and hundreds of men turned up night after night for hunting parties. There was no conclusive killing or capture of the quarry. Locals have embraced the story as cherished local lore.PINELLAS COUNTY, FLORIDAPopulation:\u00a0974,996Ethnicity:\u00a0White (non-Hispanic) - 74%; Black - 11%; Hispanic - 10%Coronavirus cases reported:\u00a020,425Median household income:\u00a0$51,454; 81.4% of the national averageCollege-educated adults:\u00a031%Major employers:\u00a0Finance, media, manufacturing, tourismRecent results:\u00a0\u201800 - Gore 50.4%; \u201804 - Bush 49.6%; \u201808 - Obama 53.4%; \u201812 - Obama 52.1%; \u201816 - Trump 48.1%On the Gulf of Mexico side of Tampa Bay, Pinellas County is one of America\u2019s true beauty spots. It\u2019s also one of the most reliably unreliable counties when it comes to politics. In 2018, it split its support in House races, but went heavily for the Democrat in the Senate race. Voters backed a Democrat for governor, but Republicans for attorney general and state treasurer. What else would you expect of a county that has picked the winner of the national popular vote in every election from 1980 to 2012? Pinellas reflects the eternal challenge of Central Florida politics. With a state as red as Alabama to the north and one as blue as New York to the south, the more moderate middle part of the state is always the decider. And in a state always so narrowly divided as Florida, every voter in the region will be desperately sought.What\u2019s driving voters -\u00a0Like much of Florida, Pinellas has been hit hard by the coronavirus with nearly 700 reported deaths and massive economic disruption. The reopening of schools in late August has been a fraught topic, especially as neighboring Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, opted for distance learning instead. Satisfaction with the GOP\u2019s message on the virus and the economy will be the main driver.\u00a0What to watch for -\u00a0Older voters were key to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory in Florida and in Pinellas County. While certainly a key target for the Trump campaign\u2019s culture war efforts, these voters are also the most at risk from the virus. Which message will connect? Plus, how will those folks of similar age to Trump and Biden respond to attacks on Biden\u2019s cognitive powers?What you didn\u2019t know -\u00a0When one thinks of nature in Florida, beaches and palm trees likely come to mind. The name Pinellas is derived from the Spanish words\u00a0Punta Pinal which translates to \u201cpoint of pines.\u201d This name was an accurate description of this area of Florida when it was discovered in 1528 by\u00a0Panfilo de Narvaez. Today the Heritage Village, known for its programs and exhibits on the area\u2019s local history, is the home to the\u00a0Shirley McPherson\u00a0Native Plant trail. Visitors can walk the trail through the pine flatwoods habitat that showcases the various plants that were used by early inhabitants of the peninsula.LUZERNE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIAPopulation:\u00a0317,417Ethnicity:\u00a0White (non-Hispanic) - 79%; Hispanic - 14%; Black - 7%Coronavirus cases reported:\u00a03,882Median household income:\u00a0$51,646; 81.8% of the national averageCollege-educated adults:\u00a023%Major employers:\u00a0Government/public education, health services, retailRecent results:\u00a0\u201800 - Gore 52%; \u201804 - Kerry 51.2%; \u201808 - Obama 53.3%; \u201812 - Obama 51.5%; \u201816 - Trump 57.9%If you wanted just one county to explain the historic upset of the 2016 election, Luzerne County might be the one. Home to Wilke-Barre in the long-ago industrial heartland of Eastern Pennsylvania, Luzerne is just south of Joe Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton and about equidistant to New York and Philadelphia. Until 2016, the county seemed to be making a pretty smooth transition from blue-collar union Democrat to suburban Democrat thanks to an influx of folks looking to get out of the big cities. Luzerne is among the counties nationally with the greatest swing from 2012 to 2016 at 11 points. When Democrats picked Biden, places like Luzerne were very much in their reasoning.What\u2019s driving voters -\u00a0Was 2016 about a fundamental realignment of the region\u2019s politics or was it a one-off based on two unusual candidates and one unusual election? With Biden on the ballot we\u2019re getting ready to find out. Except for Sensate candidate\u00a0Lou Barletta, who represented the county in Congress, Democrats had the advantage here in 2018.What to watch for -\u00a0This part of Pennsylvania holds totemic significance for both candidates, each of whom claim to be the tribune of the industrial workers who once populated places like these. You can expect both campaigns to die hard here, whatever the polls say.What you didn\u2019t know -\u00a0Wilkes-Barre, the county\u2019s seat, is reportedly the location of one of\u00a0Babe Ruth\u2019s longest home runs.\u00a0Wilkes-Barre Citizens\u2019 Voice: \u201cOn October 12, 1926, Babe Ruth visited Wilkes-Barre's Artillery Park to play in an exhibition game between Hughestown and Larksville. Suiting up for Hughestown, the Yankee slugger challenged Larksville's hurler\u00a0Ernie Corkran\u00a0to throw him his \u2018best stuff\u2019\u2014a fastball right down the heart of the plate. Corkran obliged and Ruth crushed the pitch into deep right field. When the ball cleared the fence, a good 400 feet away from home plate, it was still rising. It finally landed in Kirby Park on the far side of a high school running track. Ruth himself was so impressed by the feat that he asked for his homer to be measured. Originally estimated at 650 feet, the prodigious blast is considered to be the longest home run in baseball's storied history.\u201dOZAUKEE COUNTY, WISCONSIN\u00a0Population:\u00a089,221Ethnicity:\u00a0White (non-Hispanic) - 91%; Black - 2%; Hispanic - 3%Coronavirus cases reported:\u00a01,089Median household income:\u00a0$82,807; 131% of the national average\u00a0College-educated adults:\u00a048%Major employers:\u00a0Hospital, electrical services, higher education, metalworksRecent results:\u00a0\u201800 - Bush 65.2%; \u201804 - Bush 65.8%; \u201808 - McCain 60.3%; \u201812 - Romney 64.6%; \u201816 - Trump 55.8%Wealthy, well-educated and blessed with strong institutions, you could make an argument for Ozaukee County as America\u2019s showplace suburb. Perched on beautiful Lake Michigan north of Milwaukee, it has for decades been a paragon of the post-WWII suburban ideal. And, like most wealthy suburbs, it has been a bastion for the Republican Party, backing the red team in every election other than 1964 -- and will certainly do so again this year. The question is by how much. Just as Trump did better in the working-class precincts south and west of the city than a typical Republican, he fared worse among the traditional GOP constituencies in places like Mequon. On the state level, the county is as Republican as it ever was, with red team candidates still clocking 65 percent of the vote or more. But as 2016\u2019s presidential campaign and 2018\u2019s Senate showed, there\u2019s a serious drop-off on the federal level.What\u2019s driving voters -\u00a0Much of Democrats\u2019 message this year is aimed squarely at voters in places like Ozaukee County. When you see Biden portrayed as a good man and a moderate interested in bipartisan solutions, that\u2019s all about voters like these. That\u2019s because without much energy for minor party candidates, Democrats need voters to make the leap all the way over to supporting the blue team this year. Trump may not be popular personally here, but it takes a lot to reverse decades of partisan affiliation. With urban unrest south of the city, though, Republicans are hoping to get their traditional supporters here to stay red in order to send a message to Democrats on the state and local level.What to watch for -\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Tony Evers\u00a0and other state and local Democrats have their work cut out for them in dealing with the racial unrest in metro Milwaukee. Peace and unity would be a huge boost to Biden while lingering unrest would surely help the GOP keep these voters in the fold.What you didn\u2019t know -\u00a0As would befit such a patriotic spot, Ozaukee County is the birthplace of Flag Day. Teacher\u00a0Bernard Cigrand\u00a0instituted the observance in his classroom in Fredonia on June 14, 1885 \u2013 the anniversary of the official adoption of the U.S. flag in 1777. Even after he left teaching and became a dentist, Cigrand stuck with it and gained increasing public support for his dream of a Flag Day holiday. It wouldn\u2019t be until 1948, 17 years after his death, that the law establishing the official observance was passed.MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA\u00a0\u00a0Population:\u00a04,485,414Ethnicity:\u00a0White (non-Hispanic) - 55%; Hispanic - 31%; Black - 6%Coronavirus cases reported:\u00a0136,000Median household income:\u00a0$61,606; 97.5% of the national averageCollege-educated adults:\u00a032%Major employers:\u00a0State/local government, healthcare, finance\u00a0Recent results:\u00a0\u201800 - Bush 53.2%; \u201804 - Bush 56.9%; \u201808 - McCain 53.4%; \u201812 - Romney 53.5%; \u201816 - Trump 48.1%Maricopa County, home to Phoenix,\u00a0is big. Real big. It has more people than every county in the country except for the ones containing L.A., Chicago and Houston. It has more than half of all the people in Arizona. And until recently, it was the largest reliably Republican county in America. But that is changing. In 2018 the county went strongly for incumbent Republican Gov.\u00a0Doug Ducey\u00a0but also went decisively for Democratic Senate candidate\u00a0Kyrsten Sinema. Part of the change is likely demographic as Americans from across the country have poured in to take advantage of the state\u2019s growing economy and warm winters. But some of it is probably about the shift in the GOP. Arizona has been a bastion of what was once called \u201cWestern conservatism,\u201d as typified by Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater. It\u2019s a small-government, liberty-first brand that may not sit well with the new nationalism and big spending Republicanism now popular with the national GOP.What\u2019s driving voters -\u00a0Arizona seemed to be getting off easily on the coronavirus until mid-summer when the virus devastated the state. Much blame has fallen on Ducey for failing to take the precautions other leaders have. But Trump and the GOP\u2019s struggles in Arizona predated the pandemic. The long-term stakes for the parties are high. If Maricopa County goes blue for keeps, Arizona and the GOP\u2019s traditional pathway to electoral success look very much in doubt.What to watch for -\u00a0Immigration politics have long been the bread and butter of Arizona elections. The longtime success and ultimate failure of the county\u2019s former sheriff,\u00a0Joe Arpaio, is testament to that fact. While Trump has talked precious little about the issue that he rode to the White House four years ago, it may not be avoidable in Arizona. Though it certainly cuts both ways, it would be an improvement for Trump over the coronavirus question.What you didn\u2019t know -\u00a0The Old West may be gone, but the folks in Maricopa County allow it to live on. At the Silver Pony Cocktail Lounge cowboys and cowgirls can ride in and tie off their horses at the hitching post offered for patrons. Only six miles south of downtown Phoenix, it\u2019s a one of a kind watering hole.AUDIBLE: LIKE A JOB\u201cAmerica recognizes no aristocracy save those who work. The badge of service is the sole requirement for admission to the ranks of our nobility.\u201d \u2013\u00a0President\u00a0Calvin Coolidge\u00a0in an address to labor leaders on Labor Day in 1924.\u00a0FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cYou have stated that parties are not ideological, so is that the difference with a populist that they actually believe what they are saying? For me it's about abortion, I want to vote for the person that is against any type of abortion, no matter what. What I take away from you talking about parties, is that I should disregard every word they are saying because they don't mean it. Is voting for a populist the only way to vote for someone real?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mike Owens,\u00a0Resaca, Ga.[Ed. note: Let me make it even worse for you, Mr. Owens: Populism isn\u2019t ideological either! Individuals and interest groups have ideologies. Parties try to win elections. Republicans didn\u2019t produce a campaign platform this year for the first time in their 164 years of presidential nominations -- but that only makes more obvious what both parties\u2019 platforms really say: \u201cHere is a list of positions we think will attract enough voters without offending too many activists who swarm our primaries pushing broadly unpopular positions.\u201d The GOP has just cut to the chase this year and basically said that it supports winning. Platforms are not governing documents, but public declarations aimed at keeping ideological voters on board \u2013 ransoms paid to the party faithful who demand their own pet issues be addressed in exchange for their time, money and support. But as we saw the swing in the GOP from 2012 to 2016, the parties are quite willing to reinvent themselves to suit the needs of the moment. The parties can be vehicles for ideologies, but that\u2019s only incidental of the purpose of the organizations, which is to obtain and maintain power for themselves. Populism, on the other hand, isn\u2019t ideological at all. Populism is what we call it when a group of voters, believing that they have been victimized by an unfair system, attack the system itself. Populism is about grievance, and whether that\u2019s\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0or\u00a0Donald Trump Jr., the concept is the same: Let us rise up against our oppressors and end their tyranny. One says those oppressors are on Wall Street, the other says they are at the New York Times, but the construct is the same. Populism is a style, not substance. So, where does that leave you? It sounds like you would never support a pro-choice candidate, but the Republican Party often has. But you\u2019re not a likely pickup for the Democratic Party because they almost never back pro-life candidates. It seems you might be like the 21 percent of respondents in our most recent poll who expressed no party affiliation or only mild ones. You guys need to weigh each candidate on the issues that matter to you and make the best choice (or no choice) that suits you. A party is not a reliable custodian of one\u2019s beliefs, but rather an instrument through which voters can choose to advance those beliefs. Populism is just one method of trying to advance one\u2019s beliefs, left or right.]\u201cHey Chris, your hate is showing [by including the \u2018Read it here\u2019\u00a0link\u00a0to the Atlantic article in Friday\u2019s Halftime Report].\u00a0Since when does an Anonymous Sourced article deserve your publication?

The headline was, in all capital letters, \u201cTrump denies insulting America\u2019s war dead, POWs.\u201d If the excerpt of the president\u2019s vigorous denunciations did not satisfy you, you could have clicked through the link and you would have been bathed in the warming glow of the many quotes from people agreeing with you.

Hang in there in these closing weeks. It\u2019s just another election and it will all work out. Believe in America.]\u201cBetween [Thursday] and [Friday] morning, we heard of another report bashing our President.\u00a0 This time because of his-reported-disdain for America's soldiers, both fallen and active duty (as evident by the reported wondering that how come the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff joined in the Military, given that he was so smart!). And of course all of this was vehemently denied by the president. But while this controversy is-as of now-the latest, news of this sort, and denial or glossing over has been aplenty. That got me wondering - is President Trump the most controversial President in History?\u00a0 Are you aware of any other President generating as much controversy since the Declaration of Independence 244 years ago?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Shardul Pandya, North Chesterfield, Va.[Ed. note: As is so often the case, I think it would be pretty hard to top\u00a0Abraham Lincoln\u00a0on that one. I mean, I know the folks in blue states really don\u2019t like President Trump, but so far, none have opened fire on any federal installations. Lincoln\u2019s successor, Andrew Johnson, was also hugely controversial as he battled the Radical Republicans in Congress all the way through America\u2019s first impeachment. I\u2019d also say that both\u00a0Richard Nixon\u00a0and\u00a0Lyndon Johnson\u00a0were at least as \u201ccontroversial\u201d than Trump in their own ways. The collapse of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam strategy in 1968 and Nixon\u2019s abuses of power to win a second term divided and agitated the nation in ways more profound than the fight over whether Trump is fit for office. So many of the controversies around Trump have very short durations. They\u2019re intense bursts of outrage that quickly fade and are then replaced by the next one. That speaks in part to the nature of the controversies, which does buy in bulk, but also to the highly distracted American partisan electorate that can\u2019t ever seem to settle on what it is that matters except that they beat the other guy.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.IT\u2019S A GOOD SIGN THAT HE LOVES HIS WORKWMTV: \u201cThe mind behind the punchy signs on state and interstate highway is\u00a0Jon Riemann, a communication manager with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. \u2018It\u2019s the most fun part of my job, but it\u2019s also the smallest part of my job, so that\u2019s a little unfortunate,\u2019 he said, with a laugh.

SENATE DEMOCRATS CITE CORONAVIRUS IN LATEST EFFORT TO DELAY AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION President Trump announced his pick for the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month and nominated Amy Coney Barrett in a ceremony Saturday. Barrett is a staunch Catholic and widely believed to be pro-life. Democrats have vowed that \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d in their attempt to block\u00a0Barrett\u2019s confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate. Congressional Democrats have also taken issue with Barrett over her potential opposition to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is headed to the Supreme Court for review on Nov. 10. \u201cAs access to health care and the right to choose are under attack at the federal level, we will support, defend, and protect reproductive rights here in New Jersey,\u201d Murphy said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe Reproductive Freedom Act will remove barriers to reproductive health, as well as expand access to contraception while reaffirming choice.\u201d DEMS CALLING FOR HEARING DELAYS AFTER MIKE LEE TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 The legislation would seek to do more than insuring a woman\u2019s right to choose, but would also require private insurance companies cover the cost of preventative care, including both birth control and abortion. New Jersey lawmakers want \u201cto ensure that a person\u2019s income\u00a0or insurance status\u00a0do not dictate their ability to access time-sensitive health care.\u201d \"Together, we stand unwavering in our commitment to work towards reproductive freedom for all New Jerseyans,\u201d Murphy said Friday.

            "article_content": "Angelo Genova says abortion and health care will take center stage. The weekend that President Trump announced Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his pick for the next justice of the Supreme Court, a conversation between a self-described\u202f\u201cfeminist\u201d\u202fand a Students for Life Action\u202fteam member\u202fended when the frustrated abortion advocate reacted with violence, striking the pro-life woman\u00a0in the face. Autumn Schimmer\u00a0was holding a sign that read, \u201cI can\u2019t believe feminists are protesting a woman,\u201d when she was asked to have a conversation about what feminism means to her.\u202f\u00a0Soon after the assault, Autumn\u00a0said to the media,\u202f\u201cI told her that women deserve better than abortion and that women are not empowered by killing their children.\u201d\u202fApparently,\u00a0that wasn\u2019t what the\u202fother woman wanted to hear. In\u202fa less charged environment, how best to empower women and what feminism means to today\u2019s women are fair questions, which at one time lead to conversations on how to add things to women\u2019s lives, rather than taking people away. BARRETT TO PRAISE SCALIA IN OPENING HEARING STATEMENT, SAY COURT SHOULD NOT MAKE POLICY Feminism used to mean empowering women to take their place in society alongside men, equally equipped with access to education, justice under the law, economic opportunity and accommodation for life events.\u202f\u202fBy any reasonable metric, Judge Amy Coney Barrett should be a modern-day success story;\u00a0100 years after women\u00a0won the right to vote\u00a0she is poised to have a vote at the Supreme Court. A mother of seven\u00a0from the heartland\u00a0of America, Barrett comes not from Harvard or Yale, but from a more everyman educational environment. By merit and hard work, she has advanced, and, if confirmed, she\u202fwill\u00a0become the\u202ffirst mother\u202fwith school-age children to\u202fserve\u202fon\u202fthe Supreme Court. Her status as a working mother,\u202ffar from alienating\u202fwomen across the country, makes her one of us. Today,\u202f72%\u202fof moms with children under 18 are employed with 55%\u00a0working full time. Consider that 50 years ago, only about 50%\u00a0of moms worked outside the home in some capacity. While the\u202fsecond-wave\u202ffeminists\u00a0infamously\u202fshouted\u00a0at us that\u202f\u201ca woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,\u201d many of the rest of us embrace an integrated life in which work and family move back and forth through our minds, hearts,\u202fand schedules. Mothers\u202fare strong, fierce and capable, and as the head of an organization made up mostly of women\u202fwho\u202fhave\u202fyoung families, I know that to be true. As\u202fMargaret Thatcher\u202fonce said,\u202f\"If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.\" Judge Barrett spoke about her experience as a mother last year\u00a0at the University of Notre Dame.\u202fShe talked\u202fabout the day she and her husband decided to go forward with their second adoption after finding out that child number five\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who later was determined to have special needs \u2013\u00a0was on the way, saying: When did the feminist of today become so defeatist? \u201cI can distinctly remember throwing on my long winter heavy coat, walking up to the cemetery, and sitting on one of the benches, and just thinking two things,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cWell, if life is really hard, at least it\u2019s short, looking at all the graves. And then I thought, but in context, when you think about the value of people and the value of life and what\u2019s really most important, what you can pour yourself into, that raising children and bringing John Peter home were the things of the greatest value that I can do right then, rather than even teaching, being a law professor, which I was at the time. That was what was really most important.\u201d As a mother of four, with\u00a0two children that have the life-time condition\u00a0of cystic fibrosis, that resonates with me. Life is a beautiful choice, even though there are challenges that must be\u202ffaced\u00a0and\u202fhard\u202fwork to be done. When did the feminist of today become so defeatist, so committed to getting rid of the best things to ensure a workday that isn\u2019t interrupted by the joyful, chaotic sounds of life? In January 2017, my\u202forganization\u202fwas prevented\u202ffrom becoming\u202fa sponsor to the Women\u2019s March because of our pro-life passion, though each year, invited or not, we have added our voices to other women, calling for equal justice under the law for all women, born and preborn.\u00a0And we vote. Politicians are always trying to corral women into a group, calling us \u201csoccer moms\u201d or \u201csecurity moms,\u201d\u202fbut today frustration, not empowerment seems to be all the feminist movement has to offer.\u202f\u201cI am a rage mom,\u201d\u202fsaid\u202fSen.\u00a0Patty Murray, D-Wash., the highest-ranking woman in Senate leadership said\u202fto the\u202fNew York Times.\u00a0Perhaps she would be less angry if she celebrated the accomplishments of\u202fall\u202fwomen.

This is a rush transcript from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\" September 22, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, I thought of you, because I flipped over briefly to see what the other side was doing tonight, and your old friend Peter Strzok what's on TV.  HANNITY: Oh, no, seriously.  INGRAHAM: Talking about Russia, Russia, Russia.  HANNITY: Well, Russia conspiracy - is he still on that?  INGRAHAM: Yes.  HANNITY: Did he talk about his insurance policy? Did he talk about--  INGRAHAM: No.  HANNITY: --smelly Trump voters like me and you that go to - you know why like Walmart? You get everything in one spot it's cheap. You save money.  INGRAHAM: No, I'm telling you, I thought, wait a second is my TV stuck on like 2017? What's going TV?  HANNITY: Well, there's going to be big news tomorrow, Laura, headline.  INGRAHAM: What?  HANNITY: Hannity sources tell Hannity, and you will hear tomorrow.  INGRAHAM: OK. I love it. All right, Sean. Awesome show.  HANNITY: Have a great show as always.  INGRAHAM: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from DC tonight. Is - well, Mike Bloomberg, Florida play for Joe Biden illegal? A top election lawyer is going to tell us why the billionaires plan to pay off felons, in other words so they can vote, could be against the law. An \"Ingraham Angle\" investigation a little later on in the show.  Also, could the Supreme Court fight undermine the entire rationale behind Joe Biden's candidacy? Dinesh D'Souza explains how the Left's radical rhetoric already reveals that Joe has no control. But first, the Dems abortion litmus test. That's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\"  We saw it coming for years, but with the possible Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, the anti-Christian and anti-Catholic bigotry within the Democrat Party is now undeniable.  Now, I'm going to say it even more starkly. Joe Biden, a Roman Catholic, is now presiding over a party that has an ugly vendetta against all people of strong, traditional faith. Democrats revealed their antipathy toward Barrett's faith background during her confirmation hearing to the appellate court a few years ago.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): I think your article is very plain, in your perspective, about the role of religion for judges, in particularly with regard to Catholic judges,  SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): Do you consider yourself an Orthodox Catholic?  SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you. And that's of concern.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: You know, DiFei, what's really of concern? Is that the Democrats would even sink this low. Do they even know the history of their own party? During the 1960 presidential campaign many Protestants oppose the candidacy of JFK on the suspicion that his loyalty would be divided between the Vatican on one side and the American people and the Constitution on the other.  Now, in response, Kennedy gave a absolutely stirring defense of his candidacy and of religious liberty.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOHN F. KENNEDY, 35TH U.S. PRESIDENT: If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Well, that was prophetic. Barrett is everything that they hate. She's a practicing Roman Catholic, a mother of seven children, a judicial textualist and unfailingly respectful and courteous, even when her critics are the opposite.  Since Democrats have pegged their entire existence on preserving Roe v. Wade - they'll die on that hill, they've shunned and expelled pretty much all pro-Life members of their own party. Now, that means excluding from their ranks every Christian, Jew and Muslim in the entire country who believe in traditional gender roles and protecting innocent life, and so be it.  And now they don't even pretend to hide their anti-Catholicism. In November 2019, Letitia James, the rabid product- abortion, New York Attorney General, announced that henceforth no money from the Democratic Attorneys General Association would go to pro-Life Democrats. None of those AG candidates would get a penny. In fact, they had to publicly swear fealty to abortion rights to get money.  Now, what a far cry from the time when the Democrat Party still cared about appealing to the country's religious voters, many of whom were pro-Life. In 1993, President Bill Clinton stated his party's abortion views this way.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BILL CLINTON, 42ND U.S. PRESIDENT: an approach that seeks to protect the right to choose while reducing the number of abortions. Our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal, but rare.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Rare? Well, that's now totally out of the window. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and her Marxist mavens perhaps don't realize that the constitution and Article VI expressly states that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. Get it?  The Left always proclaims that views that they oppose are somehow outside the mainstream. That's a little trick. First, if you believe in the proper role of judges, you know that their political or cultural views should be irrelevant to judging.  Second, support for abortion-on-demand in America isn't overwhelming at all. In fact, 47 years after Roe, the country is still bitterly divided on the issue, which is another reason why it was better left up to the States.  And by the way, according to a Gallup poll on abortion from May 2020, 24 percent of Democrats identify as pro-Life. 41 percent of women say they're pro-Life, as to 43 percent of non-White voters. Are they all out the window for the Democrats as well, they just don't count?  Additionally - and this always shocks the liberal elites, 55 percent of Americans say abortion should be illegal or allowed in only a few circumstances. But the Democrats have really got themselves in a pickle here, because they're so invested in using the court as a way to advance a far Left social agenda that they can't get past and the regular legislative process, that they've alienated millions and millions and millions of moderate voters in rural and suburban America, like the people represented in that Gallup poll.  Now, of course, Democrats, all right, they think you're really stupid. They think that you're going to forgive and forget all of their efforts to cancel the faithful from public life, by the way, by using meaningless generalities about Joe's faith.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: He is a profoundly decent man guided by faith.  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He comes from a very devout Catholic family.  BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: That's what stills his faith in God.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But at the end of the day, I think he's a man of faith.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: But that doesn't inoculate Biden, or any of them from being complicit in the Democratic Party's anti-religious search and destroy mission. They've move so far Left on cultural issues, they're so wedded to Roe that they exclude and demonize people from their own church who hold traditional views on life, marriage and human sexuality. All the while bragging about how they cherish diversity and inclusivity. By the way, those are total lies.  Yesterday Newsweek published a story entitled, How Charismatic Catholic Groups like Amy Coney Barrett's People of Praise Inspired 'The Handmaid's Tale'. Now, that's like saying your church inspired The Da Vinci Code, but it doesn't make the fiction true, no matter what group inspired it.  Now, this defamatory piece contradicts itself when it states that Atwood was inspired by an entirely different group with no connection to this people of praise. Amazingly, Newsweek left the piece up, despite having to issue this embarrassing correction. \"This article's headline originally stated that People of Praise inspired The Handmaid's Tale. A New Yorker profile of the author from 2017 mentions a newspaper clipping as part of a research for the book of a different charismatic Catholic group. People of Hope. Newsweek regrets the error.\"  But this is how the Left always operates. Depict a benevolent, charismatic faithful prayer group, which counts Catholic Bishops, by the way, as their members, portray that as an evil cult and then attempt to use it against a judge who has the audacity to believe in God.  Now, I fully expect the upcoming confirmation hearing will showcase Democrats supreme desire to excommunicate the faithful from serving in any prominent capacity in government. And their actions will once again demonstrate how fundamentally they misconstrue the Constitution, their proper advise and consent role, and the function of nine justices who sit on the court itself.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  KENNEDY: For a while this year, it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed. In other years it has been and may someday be again a Jew or a Quaker or a Unitarian or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist preachers, for example, that led to Jefferson's statute of religious freedom. Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: That's where the Democrats have taken America, to a place of great national peril. And that's \"The Angle.\"  Joining me now is Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union Chair and Chris Hahn, Former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and host of the \"Aggressive Progressive\" podcast. Matt, let's start with you. It does seem that anti Catholic bigotry is the last acceptable prejudice in America.  MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR: Yes, that's right. And just look at Kamala Harris with her treatment of President Trump's judicial nominees. On several occasions, if these male nominees were members of this really radical group called the \"Knights of Columbus,\" she considered that to be too extreme.  Now, you have this question and all this writing about whether Judge Barrett should not be considered for the Supreme Court because of her religion. And as your \"Angle\" says, the Constitution is clear, there can be no religious test, consistent with the law.  And second of all, our federal statutes say that you cannot discriminate people based on religious faith. But that's exactly what the Democrats are building a case to do. Discriminate against a woman jurist simply because she is a person of faith. It's un-American, and I don't think it'll be politically acceptable.  INGRAHAM: I mean, I was watching that, obviously, famous speech by JFK during the campaign of 1960, and it really just struck a nerve with me. I mean, deep inside - arriving at a place of great national peril, Chris, and I want to get to what Matt mentioned there, Senator Kamala Harris's smear campaign against another Catholic judicial nominee.  \"It was Mazie Hirono and Harris, who raised concerns about membership in the \"Knights of Columbus,\" while the Judiciary Committee reviewed the candidacy of Brian Buescher, and Harris described the Knights as a \"all male society\" and asked if Buescher was aware that the Knights opposed a woman's right to choose and were against marriage equality when joined.\"  Chris, it isn't too absurd to see that these attacks are happening again, on Amy Coney Barrett?  CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: So nobody's attacking her for being a Catholic. I went to St. John's University School of Law, a Catholic law school. I was born Catholic. I'm going to go to my Godson's confirmation next weekend. And I'm voting for a Catholic for President of the United States, Joe Biden.  But let me explain something. We don't have the right in this country to impose our religious beliefs on other people. It's fine that she's Catholic. That's up to her. She has that freedom under this constitution. And you're right, there is no religious test.  But when you point out that an organization opposes the right to choose, you oppose - they have other positions that have been taken, it is perfectly legitimate to question a potential lifetime appointee about their position on things that could affect millions of Americans' reproductive freedom.  So yes, so I expect a vigorous debate, especially given the climate that Mitch McConnell has created for judicial nominees. But I do believe that her Catholicism is not the issue and I think that's way over the top, way out of out of out of line. And we are - the Democratic Party has nominated a--  INGRAHAM: Well, The Handmaid's Tale?  HAHN: --a Catholic.  INGRAHAM: The Handmaid's Tale, they had that up on Newsweek that was blasted everywhere. It's a cultural insult. And no one--  HAHN: How is that Democratic senator's fault?  INGRAHAM: --where are the Democrats standing up religious liberty?  HAHN: How is that Democratic senator's fault? Where are they?  HAHN: Newsweek is a owned by a conservative company right now. Let's be clear who owns Newsweek right now.  INGRAHAM: Where are Democrats, Matt Schlapp--  HAHN: --a 100 percent - religious freedom--  INGRAHAM: Roman Catholic Democrats - hold on. Where are the Roman Catholic Democrats standing up for religious liberty in the same vein that RFK with 12 kids - she would probably be looked down upon by this crew up there on Capitol Hill, who seemed to look down on people with big families, as some type of freak of nature. I'm sorry, but that's where this is going. And I think the Democrats know exactly what they're doing with this little Handmaid's trekaroo (ph). Matt?  SCHLAPP: No, that's right. And Chris just said, the problem is if they belong to a group that's anti-abortion. Chris, I love you, my friend, but the Catholic Church is a group that is anti-abortion. If you can block a judge or justice from belonging to a group, that's anti-abortion, that means a Catholic who is consistent with their faith need not apply. That is a religious test. That is unconstitutional. It is unfair.  For Joe Biden, who literally has a group, Catholics for Biden, OK, this is their moment. If a nominee like Amy Coney Barrett gets picked, somebody of faith gets picked, and they allow these smears to go forward without castigating them, Joe Biden, should this very day say that nobody is--  HAHN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry,  (CROSSTALK)  SCHLAPP: --opposed to Amy Coney Barrett based on her religious views because it's un-American. And JFK himself--  HAHN: Matt.  SCHLAPP: --I don't think would be a member of that party.  HAHN: Matt, nobody's questioning her on her religion. You are absolutely allowed to--  (CROSSTALK)  SCHLAPP: You just did.  HAHN: --question a judge--  SCHLAPP: Then why are they bringing it up?  HAHN: --about how they feel on particular issues. And if you belong to--  INGRAHAM: OK. I got to play--  (CROSSTALK)  HAHN: --membership to a group.  INGRAHAM: Yes, everyone's losing - we want people to understand specifically what we're talking about here. Here was Democrat Dick Durbin during Barrett's 2017 Appellate Court confirmation hearing. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DURBIN: I can't tell you how many nominees have been before us in this panel for the Bench and virtually all say the same, I'm following the precedent. I'm following the law. I'm following the Constitution. Don't worry a thing about who I am, how I was raised, what my religion is, what my life experiences have been. Put it all aside. I don't believe that for a second.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: So Chris, in order to be a Catholic in good standing to be on the court, you have to be a Catholic that is pro-choice, that believes in - on all sorts of changes to traditional gender roles, or you're immediately suspicious because that's what it sounds like to me?  HAHN: Most American Catholics are pro-choice. They do not follow the teachings of the church religiously as they probably should if they're not being in good standing within the church. But they do not.  INGRAHAM: That's funny.  HAHN: So - I am not of the belief that your faith is a judgment. It is what you have done, what you have advocated in your life.  INGRAHAM: What did she advocate?  HAHN: And all those things--  INGRAHAM: What did she advocate? What did she advocate?  HAHN: --all those things are fair game. All those things are fair game.  INGRAHAM: What did advocate?  (CROSSTALK)  HAHN: You should have justices who are--  SCHLAPP: Exactly.  INGRAHAM: OK, my question to Chris, and he's not answering it and I think this speaks volumes and I love having Chris on. What did Amy Coney Barrett advocate accept her belief and her faith, which I understood from the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, could not be something that we took into account for federal appointees.  HAHN: All right. Look--  INGRAHAM: What did she do?  HAHN: --I haven't done a full, thorough review of Amy Coney Barrett, but we will have one over the next 45 days if she is if she is appointed -- nominated by the President of United States.  INGRAHAM: All right.  HAHN: I can assure of it. And I'll be able to come back and tell you what she's done.  INGRAHAM: OK.  HAHN: That makes her not--  INGRAHAM: OK. Do little homework.  HAHN: --for the court.  INGRAHAM: Little homework. She's a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and she--  HAHN: We both know he is going to nominate the Justice - the judge from Florida anyway. So let's--  INGRAHAM: Want to put some money on that? All right, I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. Got to go guys. Thank you so much, both of you.  And Mike Bloomberg, as we said earlier, a big announcement from him, he's going to be sending millions of millions of dollars to try to turn out a very important constituency for Democrats, former felons. But is it legal? Election lawyer and us Civil Rights Commissioner Christian Adams says no. He's going to explain why. It's fascinating in moments.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): He thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg, and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): He just can't hide behind the airwaves. He has to answer questions.  JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: $60 billion can buy a lot of advertising, but it can't erase your record.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now those same Democrats seem perfectly fine with what looks like an effort by Mike Bloomberg to actually buy votes. Now, the former New York City Mayor raised $16 million to pay the fines and court fees of 32,000 former felons. Well, what are they - what do they have to do for it?  Well, the 32,000 ex-cons he's bailing out are all Black and Hispanic and a memo from Bloomberg's team lays out what's really going on. \"The data shows that in Florida Black voters are a unique universe where the Democratic support rate tends to be 90 to 95 percent.  Joining me now is Christian Adams, election lawyer and Commissioner on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Christian, great to see you tonight. Now, you say, I believe, that this could be breaking existing federal law. Explain it for the layman.  CHRISTIAN ADAMS, U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL: Right. Now, Laura, first of all, I understand it seems like a very nice thing to do for these people to get their restitution paid for, and for the victims of the crimes to get all this money finally, after waiting for it.  But here's the problem, it might jeopardize these same people who are trying to restore their civil rights, because it might be breaking federal law. Federal law makes it a crime to pay for, or offer to pay for or receive money for voting. And so, if somebody gives you something for voting, that is a crime under federal law, so Bloomberg might be putting these people right back in jeopardy of federal prosecution.  INGRAHAM: Now, is there tax implications here? I mean, that's paying - so basically giving people money in order to affect their vote, so any expenditure at all in consideration of voter withholding a vote. But what about a tax implication on this, Christian? I'm going back to my law school days. But if someone is - it's basically income to pay off a debt, do you have to declare that and you have to pay taxes on that?  ADAMS: Yes, and yes. Look, if somebody came and paid off your mortgage, or paid off your car loan, and just paid for it all, that would be a thing of value that you receive, just like Bloomberg has promised to pay off the debt for these individuals who have to pay restitution. That is a thing of value. So he would also be creating tax liability, in addition to jeopardizing their criminal freedom. Now, they're finally trying to restore the rights and he's screwing it up.  INGRAHAM: Yes. Well, Christian, you you've hit the federal law at play, and now tax implications. But here's what Florida law says about buying votes. \"No person shall directly or indirectly give or promise anything of value to another intending thereby to buy the person or another person's vote or to corruptly influence that person and other casting his or her vote,\" et cetera, et cetera - a third degree felony there. Could Bloomberg be in violation of that?  ADAMS: Well, this one's even more interesting because it specifically references indirectly. So if you indirectly give somebody something of value, which is, namely pay their debt, the real question is whether or not you're buying their vote, you're getting them to vote in exchange for that. And I think that's kind of what Bloomberg said he's doing, isn't it?  So it really is a real unfortunate situation. You thought you've seen everything until this year, the avalanche of money that's affecting this election is just astonishing.  INGRAHAM: Also the - mentioning the racial angle, I'm trying to think of a third problem for Bloomberg here on this as a civil matter, perhaps, with the racial implication of this and giving a benefit based on race. It's more opaque. But Christian, fascinating, we're going to be following this. Thanks so much.  And as Bloomberg meddles in Florida's election, the GOP is challenging a recent court ruling that could let Democrats steal the race and Pennsylvania. Well, Republicans are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a State High court order that mail-in-ballots received days after the election must be counted. But that's just one of several recent rulings out of swing states, threatening the integrity of the November 3rd election.  here to break it all down as former acting U.S. Attorney General George Terwilliger. Attorney General Terwilliger courts in Wisconsin, in Michigan, have also extended the deadlines for mail-in-ballots and a lot of Republicans very worried that these votes will be miraculously found regardless how much Trump might win a state by, they'll always find just enough in the mail ins, a week, two weeks later, to make up the difference. Is that a concern?  GEORGE TERWILLIGER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, it's the integrity of the election process is a very valid concern for a number of reasons, Laura, as you know it's one person, one vote.  When somebody either fakes a vote or gets a vote twice or something like that, it dilutes every legitimate voter's vote and that that's a civil right to have your vote counted on the basis of the one person, one vote standard.  But even of more concerned right now, at least to me, is that that judges are already getting into the act with changing these kinds of election rules. The Constitution, as you know, is very clear that it is the legislatures of the states that prescribe the method by which electors for the Electoral College are to be selected.  And while all states use the popular vote, it's the legislature that lays out the rules for conducting that popular vote election. And with judges already stepping in and changing those rules when elections are already underway, there are a number of laws, including federal laws, that are implicated. And those laws have been cited, at least in the Pennsylvania case, that we are already asking the Supreme Court to step in and take a look.  INGRAHAM: Would this have to be expedited on a federal level in order --  TERWILLIGER: If it's going to be meaningful. I'm sorry, Laura.  INGRAHAM: Yes. No --  TERWILLIGER: If it's going to be meaningful, it will have to be expedited because we are, what, now 43 days from the election.  INGRAHAM: This is what Pennsylvania election law actually says about mail- in ballot deadlines, and it's, \"Except as provided under this section, completed mail-in ballot must be received in the office of the county board of elections no later than 8:00 p.m. on the day of the primary or election.\" Now, General Terwilliger, how on earth could a court interpret that to mean ballots can arrive days or even, in some cases, weeks later? What does that do to, actually, what Election Day even means?  TERWILLIGER: That is just a great question, what does it do to what Election Day really means? And apart from the legal problems, this is a practical problem. Election officials, and I trust that many, if not most, election officials in the cities and counties and towns throughout Pennsylvania want to do a good job, and they want to get the results, and they want to report them in a timely way, as their legislature has directed. When courts start stepping in and changing the rules, it makes their jobs impossible.  INGRAHAM: How confident are you that this would be successful federal challenge given what's at stake in this election?  TERWILLIGER: Well, it's more that's what's at stake in this election, Laura. This is truly the only national election we have. And after the contest in Tilden versus Hayes in the 19th century, Congress set out some very hard and fast rules for how those kinds of -- the Electoral College should be administered and how electoral votes are to be determined, and the process for determining them. So there's very much a federal question here.  INGRAHAM: Attorney General Terwilliger, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much, sir.  And we are just six weeks out from Election Day. So do you know the state of the race now? And did you know that there is a Senate race that could actually threaten to upend the entire Supreme Court confirmation process? The Ingraham pollsters are here in moments to tell you everything you need to know.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  INGRAHAM: Tonight we take a look at state of the race exactly six weeks out. Just how much is still up in the air? Real Clear Politics still protects a staggering 191 electoral votes as toss-ups while Joe Biden once again woke up and called a media lid first thing on Monday morning. And today, President Trump was once again crisscrossing the nation. Tonight he found himself in Pennsylvania where he had this to say about the race.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins.  (APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Pennsylvania is a really important state, perhaps the most important in the entire race. Why is that? If Trump takes Pennsylvania, he can still afford to lose Wisconsin and Michigan from his 2016 map and still go on to win.  Joining me now is Tom Bevan, co-founder and president of Real Clear Politics, and John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign pollster. John, can't believe it, but 42 days to go. What are the state combinations the Trump team is now looking at?  JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: You can see -- again, you were pointing out that Joe Biden is quitting on a lot of days around 12:00 because his teleprompter is very hard to move out and keep up with the president.  But when he does go out, you can tell he's following the president precisely to the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. He even brushed off the teleprompter to go to Florida and give two speeches.  So when you're looking at the polls, and the media polls are coming out every day. There's tight battleground polls that look good for the president, whether it's North Carolina within the last 24 hours, Iowa, or Georgia, Joe Biden has got a lot of ground to cover with that teleprompter.  INGRAHAM: Well, FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich thinks the entire thing could hinge on Pennsylvania, saying \"Our model gives the president\" -- I think we just lost it on the screen. But what about that? Yes, \"hinge on Pennsylvania,\" model \"gives Trump an 84 percent chance of winning.\" What about that when you look at the state of the race in Pennsylvania, Tom?  TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER: I actually agree with that. For a lot time I thought Wisconsin was going to be the tipping point state, but for all the reasons you mentioned, if you look at that 2016 map, Donald Trump could lose 36 electoral votes and still win 270 to 268. If he holds onto Florida, holds onto North Carolina, and wins Pennsylvania, he can lose Michigan, he can lose Wisconsin, he can even Arizona. And if he hangs onto Nebraska's second district and Maine's second district, it will be to 269- 269 tie. But I think Pennsylvania is key. And right now it's the only one of the battleground states where Joe Biden is performing worse at this point than Hillary Clinton was four years ago.  INGRAHAM: But he is hopping over there a lot, John, because it's short track from Delaware, it's not too far, and it's a short trip. And I'm sorry, but you see Trump's schedule, every night he is out with the people. I call him the energizer bunny president because he's always out and about. And Biden is having some virtual events and a few smaller events, but you have the circles and everyone is in the circle. If you're just judging it on kind of vigorous connection to the material, just looking at that, in my mind, it looks like Trump's to lose.  MCLAUGHLIN: We don't think anything for granted, and we, as you mentioned in those states, we want to win all those things. And the president is working very hard to win all those states. And a week from today you have a big debate coming up. So I don't know whether Biden is resting up for that or he's got to figure out how to make the teleprompter work during the day, but the president is out there, and he's going places were no president has ever been before, parts of the country where he's going into the exurb counties. He's going into the parts of these states where the people really appreciate that their president is going there and fighting for them and making sure that he's going to be there for their jobs, for their healthcare, and to keep their taxes low. So President Trump I think is absolutely running laps around the Biden teleprompter right now.  INGRAHAM: And Tom, this was a strategy that seemed to work for him when it looked like people were just going to be completely freaked out moment by moment from COVID. And now a lot of the countries moving on. They know there's a risk, but they feel like they have to go on with their lives, their kids have to get back to school, they've got to go back to smart, commonsense living. And I'm not sure that strategy is hanging back, and Kamala is not doing all that much either, I think that's a risky strategy, I really do, this late out.  BEVAN: I agree with that. I think we are definitely seeing two separate campaigns in terms of the travel and all of that. And we have seen right now, I think the public -- obviously, the narrative has shifted just in the last 72 hours to the Supreme Court. And I would also add, going back to Pennsylvania, it's the only battleground state, or it's the state on the list of battlegrounds that has the biggest population of Catholics. And if in fact Donald Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett and becomes -- the Democrats attack her as they did in her previous confirmation hearings over religion, it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out particularly in Pennsylvania.  INGRAHAM: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan has an enormous Catholic voter base. And the president has struggled among some Catholic voters, and a lot of people believe that attacks on her faith, or even opaque attacks on her faith, are going to give a boost to Donald Trump. Gentlemen, great to see you both tonight. Thanks so much.  And has the fight over RBG's seat already undermined Joe Biden's entire rationale for running? What can that mean? Dinesh D'Souza explains it all in moments.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  INGRAHAM: Biden's presidential run is predicated on hollow bromides like decency and a return to normalcy. But with a rancorous SCOTUS fight now revealing the battle lines, is Biden's rationale for running being totally obliterated? Think about it, how can you run on decency and integrity when your party is once again smearing a Supreme Court nominee were before she's even been nominated? Can you promise a return to normal if your party's thought leaders are threatening to upend constitutional norms, and with an obvious power grab?  Voters have a front row seat to what many of us have said early on -- Biden's campaign is nothing more than an empty vessel. So take the issue of court packing. Remember, it was a nonstarter for Biden during the primary grades.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I would not get into court packing. We had three justices, the next time around we lose control, they had three justices. We began to lose any credibility the court has at all.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Now he refuses to answer the question.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I'm not going to answer that question. Because it will shift the whole focus.  Let's say I answer that question. Then the whole debate is going to be, well, Biden said or didn't say. Biden said he would or wouldn't.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: Why is he wearing a mask there? I'm not following that. Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator, filmmaker, latest movie \"Infidel,\" number one last weekend. Dinesh, this fight is good for many reasons, but chief among them is the fact that it clarifies that Biden has absolutely zero control over the radicals in his own party.  DINESH D'SOUZA, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, \"INFIDEL\": That's very true. He has been promising a return to normalcy. We have to ask, who has been responsible for all of the abnormality of the past few years? Which side has been unleashing paramilitary gangs on the street to loot and burn and harass people eating on sidewalks? Which party has been deploying the deep state, the police agencies of government against political opponents? The answer is it's the left, it's the Democrats.  And now, who is threatening to pack the court? Let's be really clear, Laura. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the court must have nine justices. One could have a decent argument, should the court have 15 justices, and that would, of course, diminish the power of any given president, Republican or Democrat, to dramatically influence the court.  But that's not what the Democrats are talking about. They don't just want an expansion of the number of justices. They want to stack the court. And that's a completely different matter. That involves destroying the independence of the judiciary. And Biden is apparently at least considering it.  INGRAHAM: And Dinesh, they are trying to out-radicalize each other when they comment on what should happen next if Trump pushes forward with this nomination before the election. And it's two people from the previous campaign, Obama's team, and a far left cultural figure. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want Democrats to pull out all the stops, to boycott the hearing, not take meetings with the nominees.  DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: You're going to have to get rid of the Electoral College. Democrats can stack the courts, and they can do that amendment and they can get it passed.  We're going to have to blow up the entire system.  DAVID PLOUFFE, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: They should add statehood to Puerto Rico and D.C. They should have a list of things on healthcare, on climate, on voting rights, and need to do them all. Grab the power and then fully utilize it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: He looks like a mad professor there. Grab the power -- why not America Samoa? Why are they left out of the whole statehood equation, Dinesh? We have a lot of possible -- U.S. Virgin Islands, they should become a state.  D'SOUZA: Well, the Democrats for a long time have counted on the Republicans to be the party of the nice guys. The Democrats basically assume that we will never do to them what they do to us. They can knock down our monuments, we will never knock their monuments. They can stack the court. We won't stack the court. And I think the answer to this is we have got to learn to call them on their bluff. If they want to put forward a court stacking plan, and we happen to win the House next time, maybe we should adopt their plan, and in the spirit of bipartisanship, pack the court ourselves.  INGRAHAM: And Dinesh, remember, it's not just these far left figures. It's global celebrity, former Democrat president at the John Lewis funeral who made an outrageous projection and desire unknown to all. Watch.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: If all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God given rights of every American, then that's what we should do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: He adds that whole lilt to his voice. It always has to go back, Dinesh, to a racial angle when you're trying to push something through like this.  D'SOUZA: This is an embarrassment. First of all, people talk about Obama as a constitutional law professor. Here's a guy who has never published a scholarly article on any subject in his life. The other point is that I think that we saw in the Kavanaugh hearings when they trotted out one accusation after another, and you notice that at the end of it, when Kavanaugh was seated, all the accusations evaporated.  INGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh, we've got to go. Sorry to cut you off there.  What Kamala Harris is doing instead of taking questions? We'll show you next.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The Detroit Youth Choir, are you kidding me? You all are phenomenal. And I'm so honored to see you in person. I watched you on TV.  (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  HARRIS: I am so proud of you guys. I am so proud of you.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  INGRAHAM: She touched her mask three times. That's why the masks are difficult.  By the way, more importantly, happy birthday to our executive producer Tommy Firth. He's one of the best and he's 24 today.

            "article_content": "Bill McGurn of The Wall Street Journal discusses how Supreme Court changes could impact Roe v. Wade. A new documentary featuring actress Sam Sorbo and her husband, Kevin, warns about the societal impact of abortion and praises President Trump for his progress on the issue. Sam Sorbo told\u00a0Fox News last Tuesday that the film, \"Leaders for Life,\"\u00a0is about much more than babies. Both she and director\u00a0Frank Panico frame stances on abortion as the critical issue in American society, determining how people view life and maintain civility in politics. \"It's not about babies,\" she said. \"I mean, I hate to say that because, of course for me, a lot of it is about babies, but it's about more than just babies, because babies are human beings. They grow up to be human beings.\" FACEBOOK REVERSING BAN ON AD THAT CLAIMED BIDEN-HARRIS SUPPORTS 'ABORTION UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH' Perhaps the\u00a0most poignant aspect of the documentary is its full-throated endorsement of President Trump. Many Christian leaders have coalesced around Trump, despite harboring reservations for the erstwhile Manhattan playboy in the 2016 presidential race. However, some Americans of faith are still critical of the president, his past, and the\u00a0tone he's taken during his first term. In a recent blog post, renowned pastor John Piper pushed back on the notion that Christians should weigh Trump's policies more heavily than his character. \"I find it bewildering that Christians can be so sure that greater damage will be done by bad judges, bad laws, and bad policies than is being done by the culture-infecting spread of the gangrene of sinful self-exaltation, and boasting, and strife-stirring,\" he said. ANTI-ABORTION GROUP FIGHTING BACK AFTER UNIVERSITY SENATORS SAY THEIR OPINIONS ARE 'HATEFUL,' NOT 'EQUAL' At one point, Piper calls it \"naive to think that a man can be effectively pro-life and manifest consistently the character traits that lead to death \u2014 temporal and eternal.\" But Trump's unconventional style, Sam Sorbo indicated, is what makes him such a great champion of conservative interests. \"He is the least political president we've\u00a0ever had in modern times. He's the least political\u00a0-- because he doesn\u2019t care, he cares about the human being. He cares about human beings and America and so he makes decisions based on what's good for America, first and foremost,\" she said. She pointed to Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, despite facing outrage on an international scale. Like Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Danenfelser, Sam Sorbo later highlighted\u00a0Trump's take-no-prisoners approach on the issue during his debate with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \"What Trump did that was extraordinarily brave, and what resonated so profoundly with me is he took on Hillary Clinton during the debate and said 'she supports late-term abortion, and I don't,'\" Sam Sorbo said. APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS KENTUCKY ABORTION RESTRICTIONS \"It was not even in the vernacular of the media to\u00a0talk about that. Because as the left would have you think, it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, my body, my choice ... For Trump to do that, honestly\u00a0it\u2019s hard for me to talk about it without getting emotional, because what he did\u00a0there was political suicide, and yet it worked because he understood that this\u00a0nation actually does support\u00a0life ... the loud voices don't, but the nation does. And so, we -- Frank and I -- saw an\u00a0opportunity basically to pay it back, and to say, you know what, 'we're behind him.'\" Panico says he is currently offering the documentary for free at leadersforlifefilm.com, in hopes that it will help Trump's re-election. The documentary itself touches on a number of recent issues that have flared in the abortion debate. For example, it features the Benham Brothers -- twins David Benham and Jason Benham -- discussing how their father, Flip Benham, won over Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade. The sincerity of McCorvey's conviction came under scrutiny after a documentary was released in which she appeared to say that her anti-abortion activism was an act. Several sources close to McCorvey have cast doubt on the interview, saying their\u00a0own personal experience with her flew in the face of what appeared in the \"AKA Jane Roe\" documentary. \"I don\u2019t know what the interview was that the documentary is touting, or what was said leading up to it,\" Fr. Frank Pavone, who has backed Trump, said in an op-ed for Fox News. \"What I do know is that the conversion and commitment, the agony and the joy I witnessed firsthand for 22 years was not a fake. There is zero percent chance of that.\" So far, the president has been hailed by Panico and other conservatives as \"the most pro-life\" in American history. Besides nominating a host of conservative jurists, Trump has taken a series of executive actions that seek to restrict resources for abortion providers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, like other executive orders, a Democratic president could more easily revoke those than they could anti-abortion protections installed by the legislature. Trump\u00a0ultimately failed to get a 20-week ban through a\u00a0Republican Senate, and hasn't fulfilled his promise to defund Planned Parenthood at the congressional level. Regardless, Sam Sorbo says Trump's leadership on the issue is reason enough to support him. \"The country responds to leadership,\" Sam Sorbo said, before mentioning the debate with Clinton.

Senators asked Barrett about her views on Roe v. Wade, abortion in general, illegal immigration, the Nov. 3 presidential election and other hot-button issues but\u00a0stayed away from asking the nominee about her Catholicism. \"I am thankful that the ad hominem attacks of the past on Judge Barrett\u2019s faith were absent this week, and I hope that is because our elected leaders are learning that such attacks are out of step with the Americans they are there to serve,\"\u00a0Travis Wussow, vice president for public policy and general counsel at the\u00a0Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, told Fox News.

This time around, however, Feinstein and her Democratic colleagues did not repeat the past by avoiding any comments directed at Barrett's Catholicism.

EXCLUSIVE: In the freezing wind chill outside the capital building of Cheyenne, Wyoming,\u00a0on Saturday night, scores of young and old braved the elements in thick coats and Western boots to dance to the Burning Man Festival favorite, a laser and psychedelic-like Mexican musical act known as the Mayan Warrior. It was the entertainment nightcap for a presidential convention \u2014\u00a0and certainly no ordinary political convention. Instead, the sleepy city of 63,000 played host to the first-ever Independent National Convention (INC), an event brimming with presidential candidates and a cast of characters pushing for a viable third-party option for U.S. voters not aligned with the red or the blue. Ahead of the Mayan Warrior performance at the Independent National Convention. (Fox News) \"This is about getting our\u00a0act together; we are too splintered. There is a Grassroots party, a Libertarian party, a Green Party. We have all these parties, and we all hate the two-party system which is failing to solve all the big problems,\" Dean Barkley, former independent United States Senator for Minnesota, and the founder and chair of the Minnesota Reform Party, told Fox News. \"If we can get all these diverse units together, then it becomes a force.\" AMY CONEY BARRETT'S FIRST CASE AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE COULD BE ONE THAT DECIDES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION The Independent National Convention's objective was sowing enough seeds to be able to put forth the most suitable presidential candidate in years to come. (FOX NEWS) At the invitation of the nonprofit Free & Equal Elections Foundation and the newly formed Independent National Union (INU), some eight\u00a0presidential independents staged their own debates, forums, and resolution discussions with the long-term goal of bringing \"independents together to coordinate a critical path forward that leads to more independents governing, independently.\" The cast of characters included 2020 Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins, Gloria La Riva \u2013 nominee for the Party for Socialism & Liberation \u2013 and former child actor-turned-cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce. The first Independent National Convention (INC) took place in Cheyenne, Wy., over the past weekend. (Fox News) The INC was not a nominating convention. Rather, its\u00a0future objective \u2012 and that of the novel\u00a0INU \u2012\u00a0lies in sowing enough seeds to be able to put forth the most suitable presidential candidate in years to come. While hardly in a position to give either\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0or\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0a feasible run at the polls next week,\u00a02020\u00a0has brought with it some 33 third-party candidates with varying ballot\u00a0access, state by state. Probably the\u00a0most known name on the ticket \u2013 who was urged to attend the INC to join the debate but ultimately did not show up\u00a0\u2013 is rapper\u00a0Kanye West, who founded his own \"Birthday Party\" and threw his hat in the ring on July 4. TRUMP STUMPING IN PENNSYLVANIA IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN'S FINAL WEEK Historically, third-party candidacy has been viewed as having an impact not because a candidate stands to win but because it takes potentially pivotal votes away from the two main parties, in an act termed \"a spoiler.\" \"Some of us still remember the elections in 1992 when Ross Perot ran as an independent and obtained over 18 million votes, basically draining George Bush's (Sr.) base,\" recalled Carsten Pfau, economist and founder of the Agri Terra Group. \"If Ross Perot had not run, Bill Clinton most likely would not have become president, and we would never have experienced the subprime financial crisis in 2008.\" Brock Pierce speaks at the Independent National Convention 2020. (Peter Ruprecht) Chris Haynes, associate professor of political science and national security at the University of New Haven, said in 2000 independent Green Party nominee Ralph Nader \"potentially swung the election in favor of George W. Bush in 2000, having received more votes than the difference in the contested state of Florida.\" \"People contribute to third-party candidacies for ideological or issue-based reasons;\u00a0for symbolic reasons to protest and register their frustration with the primary party candidates;\u00a0for political reasons to support friends and home state candidates;\u00a0and at times for strategic reasons to take votes and support away from one of the major party candidates,\" Haynes explained. Earlier this year, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz mulled such a bid for the White House \u2013 igniting pushback and concern from Democrats that someone of his stature and wealth could drive votes from their base. In the end, he chose not to take the plunge. \"We won't know until after the election what kind of impact (independents) have had, but the one thing that is always brought up is the concept of a spoiler,\" Pierce said. \"But it is flawed thinking to demand that everybody vote red or blue. The beauty of this system is that our right to vote entitles us with the ability to vote for whoever we want, and the idea that we have a choice should not be forgotten.\" BROCK PIERCE, 'THE MIGHTY DUCKS' CHILD STAR TURNED TECH BITCOIN BILLIONAIRE, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER Democratic and Republican nominees are etched onto the ballot automatically, but independents have to jump through an array of regulatory hoops in all 50 states \u2013 from fluctuating signature mandates to filing early deadlines \u2013 and often have to put up hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars to keep a campaign afloat. \"The only scenario I could see a third-party candidate winning, much less competing for the U.S. presidency, is if a universally known and beloved figure with access to massive resources begun a campaign at least two to three years before the election to build an organization, establish name recognition, gain endorsements, and build momentum,\" Haynes said. Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden during the second and final presidential debate Thursday, Oct. 22, 2020, at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Barkley concurred that in order for a third-party to really make any inroads, they have to start with either fame and/or a lot of financial resources. \"It is that simple, that is needed and then getting on the debate stage is the second struggle. There are a lot of barriers, but they can all be solved,\" Barkley\u00a0said. \"In this country, money or fame is the great equalizer. I used money and fame with a retired professional wrestler.\" BIDEN RIPS HUNTER BIDEN EMAIL LEAK AS 'SMEAR CAMPAIGN,' SAYS RUSSIA TRYING TO SPREAD DISINFORMATION Barkley is referring to his role as chairman of Jesse Ventura's triumphant gubernatorial campaign in 1998, of which Ventura went on to become the 38th governor of Minnesota. He claimed they were outspent by their competition 20 to 1, but still went on to win in large part due to Ventura's notoriety from Hollywood and the ring. And it seems Ventura himself hasn't given up the possibility of an independent presidential quest. \"Jesse was almost going to run in this cycle as the Green Party candidate, but they couldn't get their act together,\" Barkley noted. \"But he hasn't given up the ghost yet.\" For the likes of Pierce, its\u00a0campaign cost well into the millions \u2014\u00a0a large team of veteran strategists, management, planners coupled with a decked-out tour bus, media buys, permits, events, material, and transportation spanning a different state almost every other day since July. However, he asserts that it all comes down to propelling a long-term vision of unification and starting what he hopes to be a new \"movement\" that won't end on Nov. 3. \"One of the reasons China is so successful is because it has long-term plans for the country, not just to the next reelection campaign,\" Pierce continued. \"Campaigns are like a startup; you have to build something from nothing.\" SUSAN COLLINS, LAST VESTIGE OF NEW ENGLAND GOP REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS, FIGHTING FOR POLITICAL LIFE It has been done \u2014\u00a0but a long time ago. Founding Father George Washington \u2013 averse to the notion of political pigeonholing \u2013 was unanimously elected an independent in 1789, but federal inroads have since faltered. Yet on state levels, independent triumphs are more attainable. Alaska, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Rhode Island\u00a0and Oregon have all,\u00a0at some point, chosen an independent candidate as governor. Despite the hurdles, those dedicated to the mission insist that this is merely the beginning \u2014\u00a0and won't stop until the many Americans who don't identify with either main party have a chance to really make their nonpartisan vote count. Brittany Kaiser, a co-host of the INC, data activist and former\u00a0business development\u00a0director for the now-defunct\u00a0Cambridge Analytica\u00a0\u2013 which fell apart after information emerged concerning\u00a0its misuse of Facebook data\u00a0may have swayed the\u00a02016 U.S. presidential election\u00a0\u2013 stressed that she has worked on three Democrat and three Republican campaigns in her life, but has found her home in the nonpartisan hot seat. \"Independents should have a voice, especially at a time when a lot of Americans have said they aren't interested in the two main choices,\" Kaiser said. \"I know Joe from the 07/08 Obama campaign, and he was great \u2014\u00a0then.\" Brittany Kaiser, co-host of INC. (Peter Ruprecht \u200b) The data expert also warned that Americans should take much of the polling out there with a grain of salt\u00a0\u2014\u00a0underscoring that the vast majority only take a few hundred, or a few thousand responses, are attempting to model it as a sample of the entire country. \"It just isn't scientifically valid. When I was at Cambridge, we were really the ones who saw that Donald Trump had a chance of winning in 2016,\" Kaiser surmised, adding that polling is also deeply problematic when it comes to giving an independent a fair shot. \"When pollsters call, they only ask about Trump or Biden. So how can an independent get to 15%\u00a0and on the debate stage if their name isn't even mentioned?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But perhaps the most conventional component of a somewhat unconventional independent run \u2013 aligned with the traditions of the Republican and Democrat hopefuls \u2013 is the tenant for faith to play a prominent role on the campaign trail. Kanye West's running mate, Michelle Tidball, is a Wyoming-based Christian preacher, and his number one campaign issue centers on \"restoring prayer in the classroom\" along with a pro-life platform. And for Pierce, devotion is the soul of all he stands for. \"Faith is paramount; I would not be doing this otherwise,\" he added. \"I would attribute all my success in life to God, and I will take credit for all the failures.\"",

Anthony\u2019s life and achievements on her 197th birthday President Trump announced Tuesday morning he will give a posthumous pardon to Susan B. Anthony, one of history's biggest figures in the women's suffrage movement. The announcement came 100 years to the day after the 1920 ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. Anthony, a strong anti-slavery pioneer who died in 1906, had been arrested in 1872 for violating laws that had permitted only men to vote in the presidential election. TRUMP SAYS HE WILL PARDON SOMEONE 'VERY, VERY IMPORTANT' TUESDAY She was then indicted, tried\u00a0and convicted for voting illegally and sentenced\u00a0to pay a fine of $100 and court costs.

Bob Good, a Republican House candidate from Virginia who ousted his district\u2019s incumbent GOP congressman at a party convention over the summer, is sticking to his guns in a close general election campaign. He\u2019s unapologetically pro-law enforcement, pro-Second Amendment and pro-life, he told Fox News Wednesday. \u201cThe positions that my campaign represents are aligned with the values of the voters in the 5th District,\u201d he said. Bob Good, Republican candidate for Virginias 5th Congressional District, speaks during a rally at the Bedford County Courthouse in Bedford, Va., on Sept. 8. (Getty Images) Running a tightly contested race against Democratic nominee Dr. Cameron Webb in the 10,000-square mile district, Good said he hopes his record of hard work, values and consistency will resonate with voters \u2013 even those who might have different views. \u201cYes the district leans conservative, but you\u2019ve got folks from all spectrums,\u201d Good said. \u201cI think people respect that I\u2019m a person of conviction, a person of principle. ... Everyone\u2019s not gonna agree with you on every single issue.\u201d VIRGINIA GOP CHALLENGER CONFIDENT IN CLOSE HOUSE RACE THAT HAS OUTSPENT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS The sprawling district spreads nearly all the way from the North Carolina border to the suburbs of Washington, covering more ground than New Jersey, and although it has traditionally been represented by a Republican, both campaigns see it as a close contest. The last time it had a Democratic congressman was in 2008, when Tom Perriello unseated former GOP Rep. Virgil Goode in a narrow upset. Republicans regained the seat two years later. Good ousted the district\u2019s incumbent GOP\u00a0Rep. Denver Riggleman\u00a0at the party convention over the summer.\u00a0Riggleman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus who had been endorsed by\u00a0President Trump, may have\u00a0upset some Republicans\u00a0in the district last summer after officiating the wedding of two male campaign aides. Before running for Congress, Good had careers in banking and as an athletics administrator for Liberty University, his alma mater, where he raised millions of dollars for the Flames Club. He also served a four-year term on the Campbell County Board of Supervisors, where he said he helped raise the sheriff\u2019s department budget by 17 percent. Although Liberty University itself sits just outside the congressional district, its broader community sprawls across the line and is deeply interconnected with the 5th District, Good said. \u201cMy campaign has received overwhelming support and encouragement from members of the Liberty community and like-minded people throughout this part of the district who share the conservative values,\u201d he said. He said that as the Democratic Party moves further left with the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, he would aim to \u201cdraw that contrast between the competing visions for our country.\u201d \u201cI think people realize that it really is the most important election of our lifetime, and the choices could not be more clear,\u201d Good said. He argued that his Democratic opponent would support left-wing calls to defund police and \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion anytime, anywhere.\u201d Webb disputed those characterizations, saying that as the son of a law enforcement officer, he would support increasing police salaries and funding for social services. On abortion, he argued that lawmakers should not have control over the issue. VIRGINIA JUDGE RULES IN PARTIAL FAVOR OF GOP-LED ELECTION INTEGRITY LAWSUIT \u201cI believe that those are decisions best made between a woman, her doctor, and her faith,\u201d Webb said. \u201cAnd, of course, I support reasonable limitations as have been upheld under Roe v. Wade.\u201d He also pledged to put the district's voters above party affiliation and noted that he served in White House advisory roles for both the\u00a0Obama and Trump administrations. Good has received endorsements from a slew of high-profile Republicans, including the president, and conservative leaders like Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and Reps. Jim Jordan and Louie Gohmert. \u201cThey see him as a Freedom Caucus guy,\u201d Good\u2019s campaign manager Nancy Smith told Fox News earlier in the week. \u201cHe would very much fit in that mold.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP On his support for President Trump, he pointed to the booming pre-COVID economy. \u201cI believe very much in the president\u2019s economic policies that have given us the greatest economy of my lifetime, record low unemployment, millions moved off poverty, food stamps, wage growth that we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd energy independence I think is a big one too. ... $2 gas prices instead of the $4 gas prices that we had in the previous administration.\u201d Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Kamala Harris' victory in the presidential election. \"It's amazing.\u00a0It's amazing.\u00a0It brings tears to my eyes and\u00a0joy to my heart.\u00a0And my, you know, almost\u00a018-year-old daughter that feels\u00a0thrilled.\u00a0I know there are young girls,\u00a0and I hope young boys all over\u00a0this country who see themselves\u00a0in her and the opportunity for\u00a0them to be who they want to be,\" Rice said. She acknowledged the \"historic, groundbreaking moment,\" as Harris will be the first female vice president and the first Black and South Asian VP. In August, Rice opened up about her right-leaning son in an interview, saying blood is thicker than politics. \"I have a 23-year-old son whom I love dearly, whose politics are very, very different from my own and from the rest of our family,\" the former Obama administration Cabinet member\u00a0told NPR. \"My son and I will have some robust disagreements over some matters of policy, not all. And yet, at the end of the day, you know, I love him dearly, and he loves me.\" Rice, who served as ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013 and as national security adviser from 2013 to 2017, was reportedly on Joe Biden\u2019s shortlist for potential vice presidential choices. BIDEN CONFIDANTS REPORTEDLY SEE VP LIST NARROWED DOWN TO 2 Rice said even though her son's political beliefs differ from her own, she believes in respecting those with differing political views and finding areas of agreement. And, she said, she and her son don't disagree on everything. \"We agree, for example, on the importance of the United States playing a responsible, principled leadership role in the world,\u201d Rice said of her son. \"We agree on the importance of having strong alliances. We agree we have to be clear-eyed and strong in dealing with adversaries like Russia and the threat that China may pose. We disagree on things like choice. I'm pro-choice. He's pro-life. That's the kind of difference that we ought to be able to respect.\" Rice\u2019s son confirmed to Fox News in 2018 that he and his mother are able to find common ground in their political views, despite disagreeing on most \u201c standard Republican/Democrat disagreements.\u201d SUSAN RICE: 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN'S POSSIBLE DEMOCRATIC VP CONTENDER \u201cWe agree that America is the greatest nation the world has ever seen, and thus, we believe that America has an important role to play as a force for liberty and justice on the world stage. We support robust American engagement in Africa, and we agree that Russia poses a major threat to American interests. We agree on the importance of American allies, and in a continued American commitment to NATO,\u201d the younger Rice said.

John Kasich said his disagreements with a potential Biden-Harris administration over abortion was \u201cdwarfed\u201d by the fact that Joe Biden could \u201cpull us together\u201d as a country. \u201cI do believe four more years of this division is wrecking the very soul of our country, and we continue down this path, I don\u2019t know how we come back,\u201d Kasich said of the Trump administration on ABC's \"The View.\" 'LIFELONG REPUBLICAN' JOHN KASICH URGES FELLOW REPUBLICANS TO ABANDON TRUMP View conservative co-host Meghan McCain\u00a0asked the Ohio Republican how he would \u201cpush back\u201d against a voter like her who\u2019s concerned about issues, such as abortion, in a Biden-Harris administration. \"I disagree with Joe Biden in a number of areas. I don\u2019t agree with him in capital gains taxes,\" Kasich said.\u00a0\"But the issues here are dwarfed, in my opinion, by the fact that he\u2019s a person that can pull us together.\" Kasich headlined at the Democratic Convention in August. At the time, he said\u00a0he was proud to be a lifelong Republican, but \u201cthat attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country.\u201d Before the convention, a number of anti-abortion Democrats lobbied the party to change its platform on abortion. They argued\u00a0\u00a0\"extreme\" deviation on the issue that could effectively surrender certain states to\u00a0Republicans\u00a0in\u00a0November. ANTI-ABORTION DEMS REQUEST PLATFORM CHANGE, PLAN PROTESTS AHEAD OF CONVENTION \"We should not cede large swathes of the United States to the Republican Party,\" read a letter signed by Louisiana Gov. John\u00a0Bel Edwards and dozens of other Democratic politicians. And abortion and pro-life policies are a concern for McCain\u00a0in the coming election. \u201cYou\u2019re pro-life, and I know that. You were pro-life in politics, as am I,\" McCain, who is pregnant,\u00a0told Kasich. \"It\u2019s a big part of who I am and my platform, and I don\u2019t think taxpayers should be funding abortions for women who are as pregnant as I am right now.\u201d The Democrats'\u00a0stance on abortion rights concerns her as does Sen. Kamala Harris, who McCain said\u00a0sponsored a bill that would have removed limits on abortions. \"So do I think that if he wins --\u00a0that all of a sudden --\u00a0all these things are going to happen that are negative?\" Kasich asked. \"No, I don\u2019t believe that at all because that\u2019s not his character. That is not who he is.\" Kasich also pushed back against Trump who called Biden a \u201ctrojan horse for socialism. \"I don\u2019t believe that because I know the measure of the man is reasonable, faithful, respectful,\" Kasich said. \"And you know, no one pushes Joe Biden around.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. HANNITY: All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\".We start tonight, a FOX News alert -- the president of the United States,\u00a0Donald Trump, will join us live. We will talk about the debates, COVID-19,\u00a0Joe Biden, and so much more, only moments away.\u00a0Tonight, there are 26 days until Election Day. You will be the ultimate\u00a0jury, buckle up, brace yourself. This will be a rollercoaster ride the next\u00a026 days.\u00a0Now, during last night's debate, Vice President Mike Pence was unflappable,\u00a0and he not only eviscerated, frankly, Senator Kamala Harris, but he exposed\u00a0just how radical and frankly dangerous her and Joe Biden's positions truly\u00a0are to this country.\u00a0She also got caught in one lie after another. Her rambling, her\u00a0disorganized answers at times were even hard to watch. Frankly, it's hard\u00a0to believe she was ever a prosecutor given her utter lack of preparation\u00a0and terrible execution.\u00a0More importantly, by the way, today, Senator Harris and her frail, weak\u00a0running mate, the ever-forgetful Joe Biden, they still are flat-out\u00a0refusing to answer significant, serious questions, dozens of them,\u00a0including whether or not they plan to neuter the United States Supreme\u00a0Court with a corrupt practice known as court packing. Frankly, it is\u00a0unconscionable that they refused to tell you, the American people, the\u00a0truth.\u00a0I guess they must think that we the American people are really that stupid.\u00a0They really think that they can just coast to the finish line without being\u00a0honest, without being transparent, without being forthright. Now, of\u00a0course, the media mob, state-run TV news, state run newspapers, so far,\u00a0they've allowed them to get away with all of this, which would be the\u00a0biggest power grab in history and, by the way, that is exactly what will\u00a0happen.\u00a0Their non-answers as Vice President Pence said, that's their answer.\u00a0Now, coming up, we have full reaction, Dan Bongino, Karl Rove, Congressman\u00a0Matt Gaetz, the great one, Mark Levin, will be here with their full\u00a0reaction and analysis.And don't forget, the president will join us straight ahead.But first, we do need to talk about the Commission on Presidential Debates.\u00a0Now, it's supposedly nonprofit -- well, supposedly nonpartisan, an\u00a0organization responsible for carrying out the presidential and vice\u00a0presidential debates.\u00a0But today, the commission, unilaterally, without consulting either\u00a0campaign, decided to upend the next matchup between President Trump and\u00a0former Vice President Biden. Now, they were citing the president's COVID-19\u00a0diagnosis and the commission announced that the debate would be held out\u00a0virtually out of, quote, \"safety concerns.\"\u00a0The problem is that was a unilateral decision. They did not consult with\u00a0the president's doctors. They didn't consult with any doctor that we know\u00a0of or the Trump campaign or the president himself.\u00a0And, by the way, by October the 15th, the president will be more than 14\u00a0days away from when he first contracted COVID-19, which means he will no\u00a0longer, according to our own CDC, be shedding the virus, and will likely\u00a0have immunity, and I'm sure our doctors will be checking that out in the\u00a0first place.\u00a0So, what's really going on here? Isn't really about COVID-19, or is this\u00a0debate commission trying to basically harness President Trump and help Joe\u00a0Biden?\u00a0Earlier today, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted the following: Does anyone else\u00a0find it awfully coincidental that the morning after Pence destroys Kamala\u00a0Harris in a debate that the debate commission unilaterally changes the\u00a0format to obviously benefit basement Biden?Now, keep in mind, during a virtual format, the moderators, well, they\u00a0would have access to a mute button and sleepy Joe would have easy access to\u00a0his trusty teleprompter.\u00a0So, today, during an interview with our colleague and friend Maria\u00a0Bartiromo, the president announced that he will not participate in this\u00a0virtual debate and this last-minute rule change. And the president is\u00a0right.\u00a0It's time that we now ask the important question here: Is the Commission on\u00a0Presidential Debates in the tank for Joe Biden? Has this turned into an\u00a0anti-Trump organization?\u00a0I think the evidence and the answer is sadly all too obvious. The moderator\u00a0of the second presidential debate, if it happens, is a guy by the name of\u00a0Steven Scully. Actually, know him, met him, actually like him.\u00a0He interned for Joe Biden. He worked for Senator Ted Kennedy. Was that a\u00a0factor in the debate commission's decision?And, meanwhile, last night's vice presidential moderator, Susan Page, well,\u00a0currently is writing a seemingly glowing biography of Nancy Pelosi\u00a0entitled, quote, \"Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power.\"\u00a0I guess it's no surprise that she failed to ask Senator Harris dozens of\u00a0important questions. Why? I don't know.\u00a0She didn't ask about law and order and safety and security, and the unrest\u00a0that we've been watching for the entire summer. She didn't ask about\u00a0Senator Harris' support for that bail fund in Minneapolis that put violent\u00a0riders and anarchists back on the streets. She didn't ask, well, Senator\u00a0Harris about, you know, all about calling Joe Biden pretty much a racist on\u00a0a Democratic debate stage.\u00a0She didn't ask about the time that Harris said she believed Biden's sexual\u00a0harassment and assault the accusers. She didn't ask Kamala Harris about her\u00a0smear of Justice Kavanaugh. She didn't ask about zero experience Hunter and\u00a0the millions of dollars that he made from foreign countries while his\u00a0father was the vice president.\u00a0She didn't even ask about packing the courts. In fact, it was Vice\u00a0President Mike Pence who brought up any of these issues and when he did,\u00a0Senator Harris just flat-out refused to answer the question, and all-important power grab, a constitutional issue, something that has not been\u00a0touched in over 150 years and he asked her over and over again and still\u00a0didn't get an answer. Take a look.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you in Joe\u00a0Biden, if somehow you win back the selection, going to pack the Supreme\u00a0Court to get your way?\u00a0SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Joe and I are very\u00a0clear. The American people are voting right now and it should be there\u00a0decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.\u00a0SUSAN PAGE, DEBATE MODERATOR: Thank you, Senator Harris.\u00a0PENCE: People, Susan, are voting right now, they would like to know if you\u00a0and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court if you don't get your way\u00a0in this nomination.\u00a0HARRIS: Let's talk about packing. Come on.\u00a0PENCE: You once again give a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\u00a0HARRIS: I'm trying to answer you now.\u00a0PENCE: The American people deserves a straight answer.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The non-answer is an answer.\u00a0Now, by the way, this just breaking, the \"A.P.\" is reporting the chair of\u00a0commission on presidential debates says it is not going to reconsider\u00a0shifting the second debate from virtual back to in person, despite a\u00a0request from the president and his team.\u00a0By the way, back to Harris, she never answered the vice president's\u00a0question. The moderator never held her accountable, didn't even follow up,\u00a0so it should be no surprise that earlier today, Joe Biden once again, he\u00a0refused to answer the question. He did say he will give us an answer after\u00a0the election. Take a look.\u00a0(BEGION VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You will know my opinion on court\u00a0packing when the election is over. Now, look, I know it's a great question\u00a0and I don't blame you for asking, but you know the moment I answer that\u00a0question the headline and everyone of your papers will be about that, other\u00a0than -- other than focusing on what's happening now.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: This is a question of constitutional magnitude. You're supposed to\u00a0tell us where you stand on the positions to garner support of the American\u00a0people. Him not answering should scare every American.And let me let you in on a little secret -- and Vice President Pence was\u00a0right last night -- Joe and Kamala Harris have decided they're going to\u00a0pack the U.S. Supreme Court. As Chuck Schumer said, everything is on the\u00a0table.\u00a0Now, if they get their way and they increase the number of justices on the\u00a0Supreme Court and they fill it with new activist jurists that believe they\u00a0can legislate from the bench, people like Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor\u00a0and Justice Breyer, well, that would be corrupt, it would be illicit, it\u00a0would be authoritarian, it would be a maneuver to give the Democrats total\u00a0control over the courts and that which they couldn't win at the ballot box\u00a0or legislatively, it would destroy coequal branches of government. That\u00a0would cease to exist.\u00a0Our American systems of checks and balances would be completely\u00a0eviscerated. The media mob, by the way, is enabling them to get away with\u00a0not answering this question. What else do they have in mind? Do they want\u00a0to end the Electoral College? They want to end the legislative filibuster?\u00a0Do they want to make this place or that place or D.C. a state? How many\u00a0states do they want to have in the Union?\u00a0This would be the single biggest power grab in this country in a hundred 50\u00a0years and it would transform this country to its core in a way that would\u00a0not be good for every American and could very well destroy this\u00a0constitutional republic. It is a clear and present danger and that's why\u00a0Joe and Kamala Harris are keeping it a secret.\u00a0But guess what? They're not stopping at court packing. They likely want to\u00a0end the legislative filibuster.\u00a0Again, Chuck Schumer, everything's on the table. They want to ditch the\u00a0Electoral College. Are they ready and willing to give Washington, D.C.,\u00a0Puerto Rico, statehood in order to add four more guaranteed in their minds\u00a0Democratic senators, in their view a guaranteed Democratic majority in the\u00a0U.S. Senate in perpetuity? Do they want one state party rule, zero rights,\u00a0zero input for the minority party? Because that's what it looks like.\u00a0And the media mob, the so-called unpartisan debate moderators can't even be\u00a0bothered to ask a single question about such a heavy constitutional issue\u00a0and the impact it will have on this country and future generations, and\u00a0meanwhile the truly unhinged Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, she's busy\u00a0fantasizing still about getting rid of President Trump. She still has not\u00a0accepted the results of the 2016 election and now says we are going to talk\u00a0about the 25th Amendment, which lays out a plan of succession should the\u00a0president become incapacitated. This is where her head is at.Take a look.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): What are we talking about here? Tomorrow, by the\u00a0way, tomorrow, come here tomorrow. We are going to be talking about the\u00a025th Amendment. But not to take attention away from the subject we have\u00a0now.\u00a0REPORTER: Do you think it's time to invoke the 25th Amendment?\u00a0PELOSI: I will talk to about that tomorrow. I will talk to about it\u00a0tomorrow. I'm not talking about it today because after tell you -- if you\u00a0want to talk about that, I will see you tomorrow.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Court packing today, the 25th Amendment tomorrow. What else is on\u00a0the list?\u00a0Pretty much a typical Pelosi day, just like the last four years.\u00a0This radical extreme Democratic Party, they care about one thing above all\u00a0else, and that is power -- power now over all branches of government, power\u00a0over religion, power over your health care. Remember kamala Harris won't\u00a0even allow you to get private insurance if she has her way. Power over your\u00a0businesses, power over schools, power over your rights -- power over every\u00a0aspect of our lives.And in order to get this power, they are willing to lie, deceive, not be\u00a0transparent and do everything and anything they can do to cover up the\u00a0truth about what their real radical agenda is.For example, here is Senator Harris blatantly lying about Joe Biden's plan\u00a0to raise your taxes. Remember what he said, I'm going to repeal the Bush --\u00a0I'm sorry, the Trump tax cuts. That means all of our taxes will be raised.\u00a0Take a look.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Him -- he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax\u00a0code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That's why I'm going to a\u00a0limit the Trump tax cuts and I'm going to eliminate those tax cuts.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.\u00a0HARRIS: The truth and the fact is Joe Biden has been very clear, he will\u00a0not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year.\u00a0PENCE: He said he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts.HARRIS: Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. I'm speaking.\u00a0PENCE: The important issue is the truth. Joe Biden has said twice in the\u00a0debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax\u00a0cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every\u00a0single year.\u00a0Senator --\u00a0(CROSSTALK)HARRIS: That is absolutely --\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Every American that got a tax cut on the Donald Trump will lose\u00a0it. That means the taxes will go up.\u00a0Senator Harris also flat out lying about fracking and we've got the video\u00a0evidence. Take a look for yourself.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I am not banning fracking. Let me say that again. I am not banning\u00a0fracking.\u00a0No more, no new fracking.\u00a0DEBATE MODERATOR: Would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal\u00a0and fracking in the Biden administration?\u00a0BIDEN: No. We would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no\u00a0more subsidies for either one of those.\u00a0HARRIS: So, first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know that\u00a0Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on\u00a0fracking, your first an office, adding the United States to the list of\u00a0countries who have banned this devastating practice?\u00a0HARRIS: There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. So, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: No more fracking, no more fracking, we'll eliminate fracking, but\u00a0we are not eliminating fracking.And when all else fails, Democrats, well, they always turn to more lies\u00a0about race. That happened last night with Senator Harris once again\u00a0accusing the president of never condemning white supremacists, following\u00a0the lead of Joe Biden, who's been making this same false allegation.\u00a0Now, this, by the way, is easily documented as a lie also, that Joe and\u00a0Kamala repeat over and over and over again, and they don't care that the\u00a0evidence is proving otherwise. But to help educate them both, well, we have\u00a0the videotape.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about\u00a0white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?\u00a0DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I totally disavow the Ku Klux\u00a0Klan. I totally disavow David Duke.\u00a0BIDEN: I got back in his race because of what happened in Charlottesville.\u00a0People coming out of the woods carrying torches, their veins bulging. Close\u00a0your eyes and remember what you saw. And the young woman gets killed\u00a0resisting the hate and violence and the president gets asked to comment on\u00a0it, what does he say? He says there are a very fine people on both sides.\u00a0TRUMP: And you have some very bad people in that group, but you also have\u00a0people that were very fine people on both sides, and I'm not talking about\u00a0the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned\u00a0totally.\u00a0BIDEN: He wouldn't condemn David Duke for god sake.\u00a0TRUMP: I reject David Duke, rejected David Duke. I've rejected the KKK, the\u00a0Ku Klux Klan. From the time I'm five years old, I rejected them.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Twenty-six days of these liars in the Democratic party, if they do\u00a0well in the election and are able to carry out their stated radical agenda,\u00a0America, the country you know and love, it will never be the same.\u00a0Here with reaction, FOX News contributor, Dan Bongino, Florida Congressman\u00a0Matt Gaetz.\u00a0By the way, Dan Bongino, I know you've been public. You had a recent\u00a0medical procedure, everybody, you are in our thoughts and players, we wish\u00a0you a speedy recovery.\u00a0DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.HANNITY: Let's start with the lies. They won't tell America the truth about\u00a0packing the courts. They're lying about race. They're lying about fracking.\u00a0They're lying about a lot of issues.\u00a0BONGINO: Yeah. Well, there's a reason that they won't answer the question\u00a0about packing the court. It relates to an appearance I did with you after\u00a0the Trump-Biden debate a couple weeks ago, Sean.\u00a0What President Trump managed to do a lot of people missed. What he did in\u00a0the debate, is he managed to get Joe Biden to divorce the left. That's a\u00a0big problem, Sean, because this is the base election. There are very few\u00a0independents left.\u00a0This is an election where we're trying to get every Trump order to turn out\u00a0and Biden is trying to get every Biden voter. But what Trump did in the\u00a0debate as he got Biden to renounce Biden voters.\u00a0Now, think about it -- again, a lot of people are missing this. Mike Pence\u00a0did the same thing last night with Kamala Harris saying, no, no, no, we're\u00a0not going to ban fracking. Well, that may sound great to people in the\u00a0middle, but the radical left, including AOC, are losing their minds and\u00a0they're the ones who are going to vote.\u00a0Trump is doing this on purpose. This is a strategy and he's got them\u00a0playing their game, and that's why they will not admit that they won't pack\u00a0the court, because if they do, it will be the final straw with the radical\u00a0left and the surgical operation separating Biden from the radical left will\u00a0be complete.\u00a0HANNITY: Matt Gaetz?\u00a0REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I think Dan's analysis is right and it's borne out\u00a0by the fact that more and more Republican candidates are fused to Donald\u00a0Trump in polling and to see more and more of the down ballot Democrats\u00a0taking positions that, as Dan pointed out, might be different from those\u00a0who are hearing from kamala Harris and Joe Biden.You reported on the Commission of Presidential Debates, Sean, and have to\u00a0say the Commission on Presidential Debates looks more like a boring\u00a0Washington, D.C., dinner party than it does like real America. I would\u00a0almost rather left the cast of \"Love Island\" to set the rules for the next\u00a0debate, and, of course, the commission which represents the elite wants to\u00a0give Joe Biden the home-field advantage of a Zoom call from his own\u00a0basement.But when the jobs of Americans are on the line, when our national security\u00a0is on the line, you don't get to Zoom into those meetings, you have to show\u00a0up. And whether people like or dislike the president, they can see from the\u00a0debates, he is a person in command and he will fight with everything he has\u00a0for the great people of this country, for our success and our enduring\u00a0prosperity.\u00a0HANNITY: Matt Gaetz,\u00a0congrats.Dan,\u00a0congrats\u00a0on your health. We're glad you're doing well.\u00a0Thank you both.\u00a0President Trump will join us in a moment. First joining us with 26 days\u00a0out, his take, the architect, Karl Rove. Well, that's the great one, Mark\u00a0Levin. Now, he'll join us in a minute.But first, Karl Rove.\u00a0Karl, listen, they lied about fracking. They lied on taxes. They lied on\u00a0the issue of race. They're now talking about packing the courts.\u00a0Joe -- Schumer says everything's on the table, ending the filibuster is on\u00a0the table, ending the Electoral College is on the table, D.C., Puerto Rico\u00a0statehood is on the table.\u00a0Karl Rove, they're not -- how are they getting away with not answering\u00a0fundamental questions and lying into such a high level?\u00a0KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, they're getting away with it because\u00a0they're not being held to account by the media and because when they say\u00a0things like Joe Biden said today that he doesn't want to become an issue\u00a0and he will tell you after the election, their signaling to us exactly what\u00a0they're going to do.And here's what they're going to do. They're going to change the Senate\u00a0rules to no longer require 60 votes to take up a bill. Virtually every --\u00a0not every piece of legislation but virtually all major bills in the Senate\u00a0require 60 votes to begin the debate, and that's what we call the\u00a0filibuster. If you don't get 60 votes, you can't take it out.\u00a0Ironically, it will take only 50 votes, plus the vice president of the\u00a0United States to break the tie to get rid of the 60 vote requirement, and\u00a0that's what they're hiding. They don't want to say that they're not going\u00a0to do that, because that's exactly what they're going to do.And what does that mean? What does that mean? Here's what it means.\u00a0They will need only 50 votes plus the vice president, or 51 votes if they\u00a0don't have the vice president to pass court packing, expand the number of\u00a0judges so that the majority of liberals on the bench. Repeal the Trump tax\u00a0cuts.\u00a0Raise the new taxes that are called for in their platform. Taxes on\u00a0business, taxes on wealth, tax on savings, even taxes on retirement. They\u00a0say they want to do something but the tax advantage of like 401(k)s and\u00a0IRAs.\u00a0The public option, which is a government takeover of health care, done with\u00a0-- not like Medicare for All, that does it immediately, this takes a couple\u00a0of years to have the government take it over entirely. The college,\u00a0taxpayer-funded abortion, abolish ICE, free health care for illegals, all\u00a0of those things could be done with only 50 votes or 51 votes if you have 51\u00a0senators or 50 senators plus the vice president.\u00a0Now, you want to get a list of what they want to do? They want to get rid\u00a0of right to work, they want the federal unit -- FDR said we should never\u00a0allow federal unions to negotiate for wages. They want to do that.\u00a0They want to, quote, reimagine the police department. They want to get rid\u00a0of natural gas power plants and oil-fueled power plant by 2035. They want\u00a0to have -- they want to take 2 million houses out of 139 million houses in\u00a0America and retrograde, up fit those places.\u00a0Who's going to be 29 the 200 out of 139? They want what they call net zero\u00a0agriculture. Go tell some farmer that he can't use a tractor because that's\u00a0putting out -- that's putting out carbon.\u00a0They want D.C. statehood and Puerto Rico, and if you think I'm making up\u00a0this list, Google \"Biden Sanders unity task force recommendations\" and read\u00a0that document, 80 pages, 2020 Democratic Party platform, you will find it\u00a0all in their and their object is to pass all of those items with 50 votes\u00a0in the United States Senate and vote of the vice president to break the\u00a0tie.\u00a0HANNITY: Well, if I was the Republicans, I'd flood the zone in Ohio and\u00a0Pennsylvania on the fracking lie and I flood the zone unpacking the court,\u00a0ending the filibuster, raising taxes on the lies told. Karl Rove, thank\u00a0you.\u00a0When we come back, the president of the United States and Mark Levin,\u00a0straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: In just a few moments, the president of the United States Donald\u00a0Trump will join us.\u00a0First, joining us now, best selling author, \"Unfreedom of the Press\", host\u00a0of \"Life, Liberty, Levin\". I call him the great one, also nationally\u00a0syndicated radio host, Mark Levin.\u00a0Mark, let me go right to your wheelhouse, which is our Constitution. Joe\u00a0Biden literally said that he'll tell us after the election where he stands\u00a0on court packing. I want your position on that. Pelosi's comments on the\u00a025th Amendment, the threat of Schumer to end the legislative filibuster,\u00a0the biggest power grab that I have seen in 150 years.And tell us the constitutional significance of this.\u00a0MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: This is our Constitution. Men\u00a0and women have gone to war to defend this document. Men and women have died\u00a0to defend this document. It is the finest governing document ever created\u00a0and established by mankind.\u00a0You want to know why? Because it protects the individual from centralized\u00a0government. It protects us from the mob and it protects us from the\u00a0monarchy. Right now, the mob has a voice in the Democrat Party. The\u00a0Democrat Party wants to destroy this country. That's why it intends to\u00a0attack the Supreme Court.\u00a0The Supreme Court is one of our three branches. The Democrat Party is\u00a0saying we don't give a damn, if that branch doesn't out to our will, we're\u00a0going to destroy it. They want to destroy half of Congress by loading up of\u00a0Democrats, so there's Democrats in Congress that control that body for a\u00a0generation.\u00a0Then they want to destroy the legislative process, so nothing can be done,\u00a0nothing, to stop them. All the checks and balances will be killed. All the\u00a0checks and balances will be destroyed. Why? Because Nancy Pelosi and Chuck\u00a0Schumer have an agenda that they want to ram down the throats of the\u00a0American people.\u00a0This election is about this, the Constitution of the United States. When\u00a0you vote, when you vote, you're voting now, you're voting on your liberty.\u00a0You're voting on your country. You're voting for the men and women in\u00a0uniform overseas who are fighting for this document.\u00a0The Democrat Party is not this country. It doesn't get to rule over us. It\u00a0doesn't get to have monopoly power over our government yet that's what it\u00a0seeks.And we have a coward, a coward, in Joe Biden, a man who has been a racist\u00a0for much of his life, a segregationist for much of his life, a bigot for\u00a0much of his life, hiding behind a virus, hiding behind a virus. And he\u00a0won't tell us if he will defend the Constitution of the United States.\u00a0We have a candidate for president of the United States who will not tell us\u00a0if you will defend separation of powers. One of the branches of the federal\u00a0government because he's concerned that will be a headline? It will be a\u00a0headline God forbid if he is sworn in and puts his hand in this document\u00a0and says he's going to uphold the Constitution.\u00a0I don't know who the hell Chuck Schumer thinks he is, he's a passing\u00a0footnote in history or Nancy Pelosi, a passing foot in history, they don't\u00a0get to decide in New York City and San Francisco how the rest of us live.\u00a0Now, let me tell you how ignorant Nancy Pelosi is. How bombastic and\u00a0buffoonish Nancy Pelosi is. The 25th Amendment, I didn't even know she\u00a0could count to 25. Does she know what's in the 24th or 23rd Amendment? She\u00a0knows nothing.\u00a0The 25th Amendment provides, in part, that the vice president in a majority\u00a0of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such\u00a0other body as Congress may by law provide determines that the president is\u00a0no longer able to carry out his duties. Well, the vice president and the\u00a0majority of the principal offices aren't going to do this, so they need\u00a0another body.\u00a0The problem is, there is no other body, because there's no law that's\u00a0created another body. So she gets up there on stage with her stupid-looking\u00a0mask that looks like it was somebody's old sofa, and she gets up there, and\u00a0you know what? Come back tomorrow. We are going to talk about the 25th\u00a0Amendment.\u00a0What are you going to tell us, Nancy?\u00a0Let me tell you what she's going to do in the media are going to run with\u00a0it because they are as ignorant as anybody else. We're going to set up a\u00a0commission. We're going to pass a bill in the house to set up a commission\u00a0with experts to look at this president, the medicines that he's taking.But it's not the law, because the Senate is not going to pass in the\u00a0president is not going to sign it. She's setting up nothing. She's doing a\u00a0fan dance.\u00a0This is another phony Nancy Pelosi drama act three and a half weeks before\u00a0the election. Let me tell you about this woman. This woman has told our\u00a0airlines, our pilots, she is told our ticket agents, she's told people who\u00a0work in the airline industry go to hell and drop dead because I can't get\u00a0the money to bail out Cuomo, I can't get the money to bail out Newsom and\u00a0all these other fools that run these states into the ground, and because I\u00a0can't get that money, people are unemployed are getting nothing, people who\u00a0run those stores are getting nothing.\u00a0The airlines are going to go upside down because Nancy Pelosi has decided -- she is blackmailing America. Nancy Pelosi has decided you either give\u00a0into her, you either destroy the Constitution, or -- or what? Or she's\u00a0going to destroy the country.\u00a0HANNITY: Mark Levin, \"Life, Liberty and Levin\", number one show, weekends,\u00a0and he's nationally syndicated radio host. Thank you, Mark.Joining us now live from the White House, President Donald Trump.Mr. President, thank you for being with us.First, an obvious question, how are you feeling? How is the first lady\u00a0feeling? And I want to get into your comments that you would make Regeneron\u00a0and therapeutics free for the American people.But first, how are you doing?DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Really good, and the first\u00a0lady is doing really good.And I thought Mark was fantastic. And I love your show.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: OK. I'll take it.Have you been tested since -- your campaign and your doctor, Sean Conley,\u00a0put out that you will be medically safe and cleared for safe return to\u00a0public engagements by Saturday, five full days?TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: Have you been tested recently?TRUMP: Fortunately, the -- yes, I just saw the doctors today. They think\u00a0I'm in great shape. I'm in great shape.HANNITY: Did you test negative?TRUMP: I know when I'm in good shape or not.And I will tell you, I took this Regeneron. It's phenomenal. And Eli Lilly\u00a0has something very comparable. It's phenomenal. And it's a whole new day.\u00a0It's a whole -- and if you go back a few months, nobody ever even thought\u00a0about this stuff.We came up with it. And I'm going to have it delivered to every hospital\u00a0where you have sick people with the COVID, or the China virus, as we call\u00a0it. And we are going to make people better.It actually made me better. I went in. I could have left a day later. I'm\u00a0telling you, Sean, it was incredible. So, that's Regeneron.But, again, Eli Lilly has something similar. The kind of things we're\u00a0coming up with now are incredible, remdesivir, but that's a little bit\u00a0different, works much differently, actually. But these things are\u00a0absolutely incredible.I think I'm going to try doing a rally on Saturday night, if we can -- if\u00a0we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally in\u00a0Florida -- probably in Florida on Saturday night. Might come back and do\u00a0one in Pennsylvania in the following night.And it's incredible, what's going on. I feel so good.HANNITY: Have you had a test since your diagnosis a week ago?TRUMP: Well, what we're doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the\u00a0actual test, because there's no reason to test all the time.But they found very little infection or virus, if any. I don't know that\u00a0they found any. I didn't go into it greatly with the doctors. We have these\u00a0great doctors at Walter Reed. And you do rely on them. They're really\u00a0fantastic talents.And they came in from Johns Hopkins also and other places.You know, when you're president -- I never saw so many doctors looking over\u00a0me. I think I'm the most analyzed human being in the world right now.HANNITY: Let me...TRUMP: But we have the head people at, not only Walter Reed, which is\u00a0incredible, with the job they do, but also Johns Hopkins and others --\u00a0other hospitals.And I think they're -- I think they're amazed at how quickly this went,\u00a0frankly.HANNITY: Let me ask you.The Debate Commission said earlier tonight that their decision is not going\u00a0to be reversed, even if you get a full healthy go-ahead from all of your\u00a0doctors and follow the CDC guidelines.How do they get to unilaterally decide that, without consulting with you or\u00a0former Vice President Biden's campaign even?TRUMP: Well, I didn't even want to use them.Last time, I had a big problem. They oscillated my mics when I had the one\u00a0debate. We had three debates with Hillary. And on, I think, the first\u00a0debate, they...HANNITY: Yes.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Excuse me.On the first debate, they oscillated the mic. And they oscillated it very,\u00a0very seriously. And they actually apologized to me.HANNITY: In 2016.TRUMP: I said, what is this all about? They were Clinton people.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: And I said, we ought to just do the debates ourselves, Sean. We\u00a0ought to just -- just do it ourselves.And I pick -- I'm the president. So, if we want to have debates, I'd rather\u00a0just do it ourselves. Pick some good anchor. So, I end up with Chris\u00a0Wallace, who's essentially -- look, his father did me once or twice, twice,\u00a0I guess, on \"60 Minutes.\" He was great, Mike. Chris is not Mike. That, I\u00a0can tell you. He's not even close.But Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked\u00a0Biden about, why did he get all of that money from the mayor of Russia,\u00a0from the wife of the mayor of Russia? And Chris wouldn't let that be\u00a0answered.When I said, why did he do the billion dollars, you're not getting a\u00a0billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor? Chris\u00a0wouldn't let that. He protected him. The guy was choking like a dog. He\u00a0couldn't answer the questions, and he was choking like a dog. And Chris\u00a0kept saying it.So, now we have another one. I didn't know this. But the other one is from\u00a0C-SPAN. And he's a never-Trumper. And I think somebody said he worked for\u00a0Biden at one point.This is -- these are the people we get. And that's OK, because I have had\u00a0some bad ones over the years, and I have got an unblemished record, I\u00a0think, in the debating world, according to the polls, if you look at -- and\u00a0you got 15 debates last time, and they say I won them all, against very\u00a0talented people in some cases.But I will say this, that it is -- it's a very sad thing. Now you have this\u00a0Debate Commission is a joke. The commission's a joke. Take a look at the\u00a0letter they wrote me four years ago, when they apologized. They were\u00a0oscillating my mic. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to\u00a0Hillary, crooked Hillary, who turns out to be very crooked.Look at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her.So, we will see what happens.But, no, I'm not interested in doing a virtual. I'm not Joe Biden. I'm not\u00a0going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. And that gives\u00a0him the answers, because they will be handing him the answers, just like he\u00a0gets when he asks -- I mean, he does news conferences. He does them, and\u00a0they give him the answer, and they give him the question.And they give him -- what kind of a news conference? He does them all the\u00a0time. And he was choking like a dog the other night. But Chris Wallace\u00a0bailed him in. He just bailed him in or bailed or not.HANNITY: Let me ask you this, because I think this is -- you have an\u00a0opportunity to challenge Joe Biden directly.His campaign could make the decision to go forward with a debate, get any\u00a0health check that they want, and follow through, and have two debates. And\u00a0you could agree upon the rules. You don't need a Debate Commission to do\u00a0that.So, I guess you have the ability to challenge Joe Biden to such a debate.\u00a0Are you doing that tonight?TRUMP: Well, I might. I will do it right through your show.Let's go, Joe. Let's have a fair -- let's get a fair anchor, somebody like\u00a0the great Sean Hannity. We will get Rush.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Oh, yes.TRUMP: We will get Mark.HANNITY: That will happen.TRUMP: We will get Laura.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: We will get Judge Jeanine.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: That's going to happen.TRUMP: We will get right -- we got a lot of them out there, right? We got a\u00a0lot.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: We will get Jesse or Pete. We got a lot of them.HANNITY: Let me...TRUMP: Tucker is doing good.Look...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: This is a disgrace.HANNITY: You're going to me killed on all the FOX talk.Let me -- let me ask you...TRUMP: This is -- no, no, no.But this is a disgrace, what's going on.So, now I find out the guy that's doing it from C-SPAN is a never-Trumper.\u00a0But I don't mind that. Look at the people I have had in the past. And I\u00a0have always won the debates. I had Martha Raddatz. Her hatred was so\u00a0incredible, I couldn't believe it. But I beat Hillary in that debate\u00a0easily.So, you know, it's one...HANNITY: Let me...TRUMP: I don't mind that. It's not even that.But I'm not going to sit behind a computer, and have somebody feed him\u00a0answers, because he has no idea, because he -- he won't be president for\u00a0three months before the wonderful Kamala takes over, with her -- she's the\u00a0most liberal person in the Senate.She's not a socialist. She's a step beyond socialism, as you know.HANNITY: What did you think of the vice -- what did you think of last\u00a0night's debate, sir?TRUMP: I thought Mike was great, legitimately. I don't mean because he's\u00a0with me, and he's my friend, and he's done a great job as vice president. I\u00a0thought he was great.He's a calm person. We're really a good combination. A lot of people have\u00a0said that for a long time. I mean, he's a calm person. He's a good person.\u00a0And he was just -- he couldn't believe some of the things she was saying.\u00a0And he really didn't. He couldn't believe it, what she was saying.They lie. They lie so much, like fracking. Him and her for a year, whenever\u00a0the Democrat debates, said, we are against fracking. We will -- Biden says,\u00a0we will never, ever see fracking, and et cetera, et cetera.As soon as he gets the nomination, he has to center over a little bit. No,\u00a0we want to go fracking. We will be fracking, and her too, even her. I mean,\u00a0she's a super lib.Then they get beat up by AOC plus three, because they said, you never said\u00a0that before.Now, the press gives them a pass. The reason they give them a pass is\u00a0because they're fake. The news is fake, the enemy of the people. And the\u00a0press gives them a pass.If I ever did that, I would be excoriated.HANNITY: Let me ask you about the issue that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u00a0refuse to answer. That is about packing the United States Supreme Court,\u00a0which would be a change, and that hasn't happened in 150 years.TRUMP: Yes. Terrible thing.HANNITY: And Joe Biden literally said today -- and I was -- I -- I honestly\u00a0thought, last night, Kamala Harris would have a different answer. I\u00a0thought, when Mike Pence challenged her, that she was going to say, no,\u00a0that they would not support it.That is -- their non-answer is revealing. Joe Biden went further today and\u00a0said, you will know my position on court packing the day after the\u00a0election.What's your reaction to that?TRUMP: I think it was a terrible thing to say. I think it's so\u00a0disrespectful to the people.And he should have said something and say, look, to the best of my\u00a0knowledge, this is probably what I would do. I think it's a -- I think what\u00a0he said was so disrespectful to the process and to the people. What he said\u00a0then was just disgraceful.But what that means, really, is that they're going to do it, OK, because,\u00a0obviously, that means 100 percent that's what they're going to do. No,\u00a0they're going to end the filibuster. And they're going to do things that\u00a0you wouldn't have thought.I have been fighting the filibuster with Mitch for a long time, because I\u00a0said, Mitch, they're going to do it. If they ever got in, Schumer would do\u00a0that on day one.I agree that what they did was right, the -- you take a look at what Mitch\u00a0and some very good Republican senators did, because it's good for the\u00a0country. But I said, here's the problem. If they ever got in, day one, this\u00a0would be the first move they make, end the filibuster, the nuclear option,\u00a0as they call it.And they will do that in -- not a week will go by. Probably not a day will\u00a0go by. But, again, Harry Reid did it. That's why we have so many judges. I\u00a0want to thank you very much, Harry Reid, because Harry Reid, he ended the\u00a0filibuster. And we have -- I'm going to have 300 judges by the time I\u00a0finish, 300. It's a record, by the -- by the end of the first term.Think of that. It's a record to the term. By the end of the first term, I\u00a0will have 300 judges, just about, give or take a few, couple.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: Mr. President...TRUMP: And it's all because of -- think of it, Sean. It's all because of\u00a0Harry Reid...HANNITY: 2013.TRUMP: ... and a lot of good work by a lot of good Republicans, including\u00a0Mitch.HANNITY: Don't you think -- or do you think that the people of this country\u00a0need to know whether or not Joe Biden, if he were elected president, would\u00a0pack the courts...TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: ... whether or not he would support statehood for places like\u00a0D.C., whether or not he would support ending the filibuster, whether or not\u00a0even maybe pursue a constitutional issue amendment to abolish the Electoral\u00a0College?To me, these are fundamental questions that he is refusing to answer.What is your -- what is your answer to his non-answer? And the media, I\u00a0think he's answered less than 100 questions since this whole campaign has\u00a0started, which I think makes these two debates that are forthcoming even\u00a0more important than -- than any average presidential election year.TRUMP: Well, he's got a lot of non-answers.I mean, look, look at Second Amendment. You never talk about Second\u00a0Amendment. He wants to take away your guns 100 percent. He put Beto, who is\u00a0a -- he turned out to be -- he was exposed by Ted Cruz and me. I think I\u00a0helped a lot too. But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that,\u00a0but I want to be nice, because it's a nice evening show.But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He's going\u00a0to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever -- nobody asks him about\u00a0the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is\u00a0very important. It's a big thing.We campaigned on it. I protected this. If I weren't president, you wouldn't\u00a0have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does that.Nobody -- nobody talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No,\u00a0he's not pro-life. What is he? Why don't you ask him that question? He\u00a0doesn't want to talk about it.But he endorsed a governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby, late-term abortion, but executed a baby, because said, the baby can be born, and\u00a0then you can kill the baby. And he's totally in favor of that. And I can\u00a0tell you, your pro-life groups are -- they're en masse. They're en masse.This is -- this is their one shot, because what's going on is so -- is so\u00a0bad, is so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby\u00a0after the baby's born. That's when -- you talk about late-term abortion.\u00a0This is early-term execution.And it's a very, very bad thing. But you don't ever hear anybody talking\u00a0about pro-life/pro-choice with Biden. You never -- did you ever hear it? I\u00a0haven't heard it. Very rarely do you hear it.I don't think he would know how to discuss it. But, very importantly, the\u00a0Second Amendment, though, they just don't discuss the Second Amendment.\u00a0He's going to take your guns away. So, everybody with a gun, you can't vote\u00a0for him, because you're not going to have your gun.At the same time, they wanted to defund the police. So, you're not going to\u00a0have police protection, and you -- by the way, you can't have a gun. So,\u00a0when one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are\u00a0no cops around, you don't have a gun to protect yourself. That's a great\u00a0combination. And the suburbs are going to fall.You know, a lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs, right, women\u00a0of the suburbs. They do or don't like Trump. I don't know. But what I have\u00a0done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over, as you know. The\u00a0suburbs will become more unsafe than the cities, run by the Democrats.And so, I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I'm the\u00a0one that's protecting them, both in terms of law and order and in terms of\u00a0zoning. They want to build low-income housing right next to your house, as\u00a0you destroy -- as the American dream is destroyed, destroyed.HANNITY: Mr. President...TRUMP: But they don't talk to Biden about this. They don't talk to him\u00a0about law and order.I said to him the other night, mention the words law and order. He wouldn't\u00a0do it. He wouldn't do it. I said, no, mention the word law and order. Go\u00a0ahead. He wouldn't do it.And then, of course, Chris Wallace came in to protect him.HANNITY: Let me ask you this, Mr. President, if I may.I played at the beginning of the show -- we don't have a lot of time left.\u00a0I won't -- I won't play it again. Joe Biden twice in the debate that he had\u00a0with you said he will eliminate the Trump tax cuts.TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: Now he's -- he's saying only on people $400,000 or more, but\u00a0that's -- I will let you explain it. He says he's not against fracking, but\u00a0I have him saying he will eliminate fracking twice.TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: And we played that tape.TRUMP: Very famous.HANNITY: He has repeatedly said, and Kamala Harris last night falsely have\u00a0claimed that you do have yet to once condemn white supremacy. Yet I showed\u00a0multiple instances when you have done just that.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: The neo-Nazis, David Duke, white supremacy, white nationalism,\u00a0disavowing David Duke. And yet they continue to spread that falsehood.Your reaction, because they don't seem to get called out by the media on\u00a0the fact that what they are saying is false?TRUMP: And I condemned the people on the left, like Antifa, that are\u00a0burning down your cities all summer long, OK, and without any control\u00a0whatsoever.They're all Biden people, meaning -- not Biden. Biden's not smart enough to\u00a0know what the hell it even is. But they're of that philosophy.And I condemn them very strongly, very, very strongly. It's not just the\u00a0right. It's the right. It's the left.But the left has been the problem for a long time. Antifa is a big, big\u00a0problem.And I see Whitmer today. She's complaining, but it was our Justice\u00a0Department that arrested the people that she was complaining about. It was\u00a0my Justice Department that arrested them.But, instead, she goes and does her little political act. And she keeps her\u00a0state closed, although we just won the big case, as you know, to open up\u00a0Michigan, because what she's doing is a horrible thing to the people. The\u00a0churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed.And people are being hurt very badly by it, in the form of drinking and\u00a0suicides and depression. It's a very sad thing.But, no, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, and, very sadly, if you take a\u00a0look. He wants to raise taxes, but he says he's going to end our tax cut.\u00a0Well, people are getting actually much more. Mike handled it great. He said\u00a0$2,000. It was actually much more than $2,000 in child tax credits, which\u00a0is $1,000 a child.But he wants to take all that away. So, therefore, if you do nothing else,\u00a0you're raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our\u00a0country. If you -- if he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the\u00a0reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic,\u00a0which hopefully, we're rounding the turn.And we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics, and the vaccines\u00a0are going to be coming very soon. But I will tell you, what I took is\u00a0incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It's incredible. And we're going\u00a0to get it to everybody, free of charge.It's going to hospitals. It's starting very soon. The military is going to\u00a0be delivering it. But he's looking to do big, big tax cuts - big, big tax\u00a0increases, like at a level that's never been seen. Nobody's ever gotten the\u00a0cuts that I got.I got the biggest tax cuts ever given, as you know, Sean, better than\u00a0probably most. But he's going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And\u00a0now people are going to pay $2,000, plus child tax credits, all that. It's\u00a0going to be a disaster for our country. It's going to -- it's going to put\u00a0our country into a depression.And your 401(k)s are going to go down the tubes. And your jobs are going to\u00a0go away. And you're going to have a depression, the likes of which our\u00a0country has never seen before, and that possibly includes 1929.HANNITY: Mr. President, there has been articles out -- and I would assume\u00a0that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not giving their position on court packing\u00a0would be a national ad. I assume them both on record saying they would ban\u00a0fracking -- fracking would be an ad that would run in a lot of cycles in\u00a0Ohio and Pennsylvania.TRUMP: And Texas.HANNITY: Their Web site that endorses the Green New Deal, and Joe Biden\u00a0saying he would spend trillions of dollars on it and pledging that.What would the New Green Deal look like, in your view, if implemented, as\u00a0promised by both Joe Biden and, as a co-sponsor, with Kamala Harris in the\u00a0U.S. Senate?TRUMP: Well, it's a deal that was conceived of by not smart people, AOC\u00a0plus three and others. I don't even think they had any experience in the\u00a0environment.But this was a deal conceived of. And the real price is $100 trillion.\u00a0That's more money than this country could make in 100 years, if things went\u00a0well, OK? I mean, they literally want to take buildings down and rebuild\u00a0them with tiny little windows, OK, little windows, so you can't see out,\u00a0you can't see the light.And the whole thing is so crazy. It's such a crazy thing.And take a look. And Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because, you\u00a0know, they have the manifesto. They have agreed to most of these things.\u00a0And it's going to cost more money. Our country will be a ninth world\u00a0country, not a third world country, a ninth world country.We won't have energies. Look at what's happening with the rolling blackouts\u00a0in California. Look at where California is going to have to ration water.\u00a0You know why? Because they send millions of gallons of water out to sea,\u00a0out to the Pacific, because they want to take care of certain little tiny\u00a0fish that aren't doing very well without water, to be honest with you.But it's a very sad thing that's happening. It's no common sense. Even the\u00a0fires in California, I -- I talk about, you need -- I was with Governor\u00a0Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but\u00a0I get along with him.Number one, you should let water come down from the north and accept it,\u00a0instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest\u00a0management. We send them so much money. I don't have to, but I want to help\u00a0California.But they have the biggest forest fires because they don't manage their\u00a0land. They don't have separators. They have trees that have been laying on\u00a0the ground that are stone-cold, dead dry, like a matchstick. And you throw\u00a0a cigarette butt on it. Between the leaves and the trees, everything\u00a0catches on fire, and you lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time.They got to manage their forests.HANNITY: Mr...TRUMP: And if they manage their forests, you're not -- you're going to not\u00a0see the forest fires.HANNITY: Mr. President, the Heritage Foundation identified nearly 1,000\u00a0convictions on voting fraud. There have been -- you have expressed many\u00a0times your concern about some of the changing laws and rules and have\u00a0spoken negatively about these changes.But, with that said, a lot of states have now begun early voting. Some will\u00a0be starting in a week or two. Are you -- will you encourage your supporters\u00a0to get out and vote early?TRUMP: Well, I want them to vote, but I will say this. Absentee is OK,\u00a0because absentee ballots -- excuse me -- absentee ballots are fine, because\u00a0absentee ballots, you request, you ask for a ballot, and you request, and\u00a0that's it.Absentee ballots are absolutely fine. You request them. You fill them in,\u00a0you send them back in. But these unsolicited ballots, universal,\u00a0unsolicited ballots, Sean, is a -- it's going to be a disaster the likes of\u00a0which we have never seen. We will never have seen an election like what's\u00a0going to take place.Thousands of ballots all over the country are being reported, some thrown\u00a0in garbage cans with my name on them, some thrown in trays in a river.\u00a0What's going on is absolutely crazy.We have people watching. We have U.S. attorneys watching. We have sheriffs\u00a0watching. We have U.S. Marshals watching.HANNITY: With that said, then, is...TRUMP: So, with all of that, you're talking about millions of ballots are\u00a0being sent out.HANNITY: With that said, would...TRUMP: And they're being...HANNITY: If there's in-person early voting...TRUMP: It's a fraud. It's going to be a big and tremendous fraud.Excuse me?HANNITY: Would you prefer -- would you prefer that your -- your supporters,\u00a0if that's the system, and that's what the law is, would you prefer that\u00a0they get out early also, so that there's not a big deficit heading into\u00a0Election Day?TRUMP: Yes, well, my supporters are going to be mostly people that vote.\u00a0They go to the vote, you know, the old-fashioned way. It's like, go to the\u00a0voting booth and vote.We -- first of all, we should have voter I.D. all over the country. We\u00a0don't. You know, when you buy something, you have voter I.D.To get into the Democrat National Convention, you had to have voter I.D.HANNITY: That's true.TRUMP: You had to have voter I.D., OK?HANNITY: I had to have it four years ago.TRUMP: But to get into vote -- right.HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: But to get into vote, you don't need voter I.D. many places. Many\u00a0places, you do. Indiana has a great system. I mean, you have many places\u00a0where you do have it.But we should have voter I.D., universal voter I.D. When you go to vote,\u00a0they should see who you are, make sure that it's not fraudulent.But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent, most fraudulent elections\u00a0ever because of this whole thing with the ballots. They're sending out\u00a0millions and millions and millions of ballots.Where are they sending them? Who's sending them? Where are they going?\u00a0Where are they coming back from? How many are fraudulent? Are they being\u00a0thrown away? Are they being sold? Are they being harvested?It's a terrible thing, Sean. Despite that, I think we're going to have a\u00a0tremendous victory. I saw some polls just now, some real polls, not the\u00a0fake news polls, where they put out fake numbers like at CNN and ABC,\u00a0Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NBC.It's the same stuff as I had. It's not nearly as bad as it used to be. It\u00a0used to be much worse, believe it or not, hard to believe, when you think\u00a0of it.But I'm looking at polls that are doing great. We're doing great in Ohio.\u00a0We're doing great in Iowa. We're doing great in many, many places, many\u00a0places.HANNITY: Let me...TRUMP: Then you come home, you turn on the television, you say, gee, I'm\u00a0four down. I can't believe it.But it's -- they're fake polls.HANNITY: Last question.And I only have about a minute for you to answer. And that is the -- we now\u00a0discover that the CIA had briefed then President Obama...TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: ... on a plan that Hillary Clinton concocted to distract from her\u00a0e-mail server scandal...TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: ... and concoct this Russia hoax.We also learned that she paid -- we already knew she paid for the dirty\u00a0Russian misinformation dossier, and that the source for Steele's dossier\u00a0was a known Russian operative for over 10 years. And they still went\u00a0forward with it.In the 40 seconds we have left, your reaction to this new news.TRUMP: We caught them spying on our campaign.This is treason. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected\u00a0administration/president. And we have all the evidence now. Now we have to\u00a0see what the law enforcement going to do with it. But we caught them\u00a0spying.As sure as you're sitting there -- I assume you're sitting.HANNITY: I'm sitting, yes.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: But, as sure as you're sitting there, we caught them spying on our\u00a0campaign. You know that almost better than anybody.HANNITY: You were right.TRUMP: And it's something. When you see The New York Times, Washington Post\u00a0get Pulitzer Prizes, they got everything wrong, right? They got everything\u00a0wrong.We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them trying to take down a\u00a0duly elected president. And then they talk about, we want a peaceful\u00a0transition to power.HANNITY: Mr...TRUMP: Peaceful tran...HANNITY: Well, we know what Hillary Clinton said.TRUMP: Mike Pence's best answer was that answer last night.Peaceful transition?HANNITY: Mr. President, we...TRUMP: Look what they did. They spent three-and-a-half years trying to\u00a0terminate a presidency.HANNITY: Mr. President, we wish you and the first lady and every American\u00a0that contracted COVID a very speedy recovery.Very, very positive news on Regeneron, and Eli Whitney (sic), and the\u00a0therapeutics. And Operation Warp Speed seems to be moving along nicely. And\u00a0we pray that that gets finished quickly.TRUMP: Doing really well.HANNITY: All right, sir, thank you.TRUMP: Thank you very much.HANNITY: Twenty-six days.TRUMP: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: Let not your heart be troubled, Laura Ingraham is standing by.\u00a0I owe you 20 seconds. Every time I interview the president, I end up owing\u00a0you something. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL\u00a0RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Article III Project president Mike Davis weighs in on the upcoming Supreme Court battle Democratic senators are expected to\u00a0press Amy Coney Barrett on the issue of abortion\u00a0when the Senate Judiciary Committee kicks off hearings Monday on her nomination for the\u00a0Supreme Court, as Republicans vow to defend her against any attacks related to her Catholic faith. With Barrett forming a\u00a06-3 conservative majority if confirmed, Democrats contend that the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling \u2013 granting a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy \u2013 could be undermined or overturned. Their questioning, though, is likely to be met with resistance from Republicans who have defended the nominee in recent weeks over questions about her Catholic faith. Last week,\u00a0Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited\u00a0\"ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media\" related to her faith and called it a \"disgrace.\" DETAILS OF AMY CONEY BARRETT'S MONDAY CONFIRMATION HEARING RELEASED Democrats have signaled what's likely to be the focus of their abortion questioning: For the pro-choice camp, some of their biggest\u00a0anxieties stem from a 2006 newspaper advertisement that she did not submit to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Taken out by the St. Joseph County Right to Life group in Indiana, the two-page ad \u2013 signed by then-University of Notre Dame law professor Barrett and her husband in addition to hundreds of other residents \u2013 annotated that life beings at \"fertilization\" and opposed the concept of \"abortion on demand.\" \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade,\" the ad read. \"And restore law that protects the lives of unborn children.\" Judge Amy Coney Barrett speaks after President Donald Trump announced Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) On Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats \u2013 led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California \u2013 sent a letter\u00a0to the Justice Department, seeking an explanation as to why the 14-year-old advertisement was not submitted to the committee as part of the nominee's questionnaire. WHERE DOES JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT STAND ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT? But just prior to becoming a federal judge (she\u00a0currently sits on\u00a0the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, after being picked by President Trump\u00a0in early 2017), Barrett told an\u00a0audience at Jacksonville University that while she did not think there was the impetus for Roe to be overturned, access to abortion could be restricted. \"The core case \u2013 Roe's core holding that women have a right to an abortion \u2013 I don't think that would change. But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics,\" she said. \"I think that would change.\" Democrats next week are also likely to press down on Barrett's 2013 essay on the ruling, as a Notre Dame professor. \"If anything, the public response to controversial cases like Roe reflects a public rejection of the proposition that stare decisis can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle rather than desire that precedent remains forever unchanging,\" she wrote. That same year, a Notre Dame Magazine article drew on a lecture given by Barrett, underscoring that she \"spoke both to her own conviction that life begins at conception\" and to the\u00a0\"'high price of pregnancy' and 'burdens of parenthood' that especially confront women.\" JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT: 5 THINGS TO KNOW Barrett belonged to the Notre Dame chapter of a pro-life club called University Faculty for Life. In 2016, while the professor was still a member, the group adopted\u00a0a resolution that \"every human being, from the moment of conception and until natural death, must be cherished and protected, and must never be intentionally killed.\" The resolution was written as a rebuff of the university opting to award Democrat\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0a medal, stressing that the then-vice president \"has for decades conspicuously rejected Church teaching about life.\" \"He has rejected it repeatedly and consistently in the context of abortion, where (he has been quoted as saying) he would not want to 'impose' this teaching upon a woman and her doctor,\" the resolution continued. As a federal judge, Barrett has dealt with just a few cases pertaining to the abortion issue. AMY CONEY BARRETT HEARINGS: HERE ARE THE CORONAVIRUS PRECAUTIONS BEING TAKEN A three-judge panel voided a request from Indiana, asking the full appeals court to re-evaluate only the state's provision on fetal remains and not the provisions concerned with prohibiting abortion on the grounds of race, disability, or sex of the fetus. Barrett sided with her fellow judge's dissent, which expressed that the law's provision barring abortion on the basis of race, disability or sex of the fetus\u00a0was a \"eugenics statute,\" and that there is a \"difference between 'I don't want a child' and 'I want a child, but only a male, or 'I want only children whose genes predict success in life.'\" In another case, the panel threw out a Planned Parenthood lawsuit challenging parental notification for minors seeking abortions, declining Indiana's appeal to review the case. But even if Roe remains, court observers\u00a0say there are more than a dozen cases currently permeating in courts across the country regarding abortion issues that could land in the Supreme Court, which could ultimately begin to re-shape the debate. These range from determining when pregnancy termination should be outlawed (anywhere from six to 10\u00a0weeks) to\u00a0mandates for the burial of fetal tissue and\u00a0parental notification of\u00a0hospital admissions. DEROY MURDOCK: A 'GINSBURG AMENDMENT' PLEDGE WOULD UNITE GOP, SPLIT DEMOCRATS During her confirmation hearing in 2017, Barrett spoke of\u00a0following the precedent set by\u00a0the Supreme Court. \"Roe has been affirmed many times and survived many challenges in the court, and it's more than 40 years old, and it's clearly binding on all Court of Appeals,\" she said. \"And so it is not open to me or up to me, and I would have no interest in, as a Court of Appeals judge, challenging that precedent \u2013 it would bind.\" When questioned by then-Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, about her Catholic faith, and whether it is \"proper for a judge to put their religious views above applying the law,\" Barrett responded: \"If there is ever a conflict between a judge's personal conviction and that judge's duty under the rule of law, ...\u00a0it is never, ever permissible for that judge to follow their personal convictions in the decision of the case rather than what the law requires.\" AMY CONEY BARRETT'S SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION SCHEDULE: A TIMELINE But if she takes a seat on the high court, Barrett will have much greater power\u00a0to alter the abortion trajectory. \"There has always been an issue over the legitimacy of Roe v. Wade \u2013 nowhere is there any clear constitutional directive,\" Allan Saxe, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, told Fox News. \"Roe was decided on a vague constitutional amendment \u2013 the Ninth Amendment, which obliquely contains 'right to privacy,' so justices placed abortion rights within the orbit on privacy, which is dubious at best. If Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed, there likely will be an early state challenge to Roe. To Democrats, Roe v. Wade is a hallmark issue.\" Kelly Hyman, an attorney\u00a0and Democratic political strategist, believes\u00a0Barrett potentially would move to \"overrule Roe v. Wade,\" and \"it would be 20 years before that ruling would be overruled.\" DEMOCRATS RESIGNED THAT AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION IS INEVITABLE: 'WE CAN'T STOP THE OUTCOME' So while pro-choice groups are staunchly behind Barrett's confirmation, equally as impassioned are reproductive rights advocates. \"For only the second time since our founding in 1992, the Center for Reproductive Rights is opposing the confirmation of a U.S. Supreme Court nominee,\" Nancy Northup, the center's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday. \"Her record in opposition to reproductive rights is clear and alarming. Indeed, Judge Barrett has the most extreme record in opposition to reproductive rights as any Supreme Court nominee since the rejected nomination of Judge Robert Bork over 30 years ago.\" Amid the controversy surrounding Barrett's nomination, Biden stated during\u00a0an NBC Town Hall earlier this week that, if elected president, he will move to safeguard abortion rights should a Supreme Court nullify Roe v. Wade, vowing to make it \"the law of the land.\" Judge Amy Coney Barrett speaks after President Donald Trump announced Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) That would be difficult, according to Cristina Antelo, a federal government policy attorney and CEO of political consulting firm FEROX Strategies. Antelo said\u00a0a president can only sign legislation passed by both houses of Congress, not change the law on his\u00a0own. \"Biden is saying he would support it being the law of the land, and should the Senate flip to Dem control in addition to the House remaining in Dem control; then it will be on his policy agenda,\" she said. \"Presidents can use the power of their pen to make pronouncements through executive orders, much like Trump has tried to do. But as we have learned, there is not much actual power in those.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP For his part, Trump has maintained that he did not ask and does not know Barrett's position on\u00a0Roe v. Wade. In her remarks following her\u00a0nomination\u00a0last month, Barrett again vowed to put aside her personal beliefs while on the Supreme Court. \"Judges are not policy-makers,\" she said. \"And they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.\"",

An\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0official in Kentucky chastised Transylvania University over the weekend\u00a0for accepting Nicholas Sandmann as a student, calling the move a \"stain\" on the institution. Sandmann made headlines back in January 2019 when a Native American activist stood in front of the teen and began chanting in his face during a pro-life rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\u00a0Sandmann, who was wearing a MAGA hat at the time and is a supporter of President Trump, held his ground and smiled at the man as he continued to talk in his face. \u201cDoes anyone else think it\u2019s a bit of a stain on Transylvania University for accepting Nick Sandman [sic]? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a \u201cboth sides\u201d defense, but it\u2019s pretty counter to their mission and another instance of there not actually being equal sides to an issue,\u201d ACLU\u2019s\u00a0Samuel Crankshaw said in a\u00a0Facebook post, according to The National Review. The comment was temporarily taken down for an additional note to be added but was eventually restored and came back online. Crankshaw later reached out to Fox News and provided this brief statement: \"The views I expressed on my Facebook page are my personal views that I shared on my personal time,\" he said in an email. \"I have a First Amendment right to express them just as Nick Sandmann has a First Amendment right to express his. My views do not necessarily reflect the views of my current or past employers. I will continue to express my views on my personal time.\" Amber Duke, Deputy Director for the ACLU of Kentucky, also reached out to Fox News following the story's publication and provided a statement supportive of Crankshaw, but said his views do not necessarily\u00a0represent that of the organization. \u201cThese were personal views expressed on personal time on a personal Facebook account,\" she wrote in a statement. \"The views in this post do not necessarily reflect the views of the ACLU of Kentucky. As a stalwart defender of the First Amendment, the ACLU of Kentucky respects its employees' freedom to express themselves on their own time.\u201d COVINGTON CATHOLIC TEEN NICK SANDMANN SLAMS MEDIA, LEFT FOR 'CANCEL CULTURE' AFTER VIRAL VIDEO Following the Lincoln Memorial confrontation , outlets such as CNN and The Washington Post were accused of purposely casting Sandmann \u2013\u00ad\u00a0and his fellow Covington Catholic students \u2013\u00ad\u00a0as the main aggressors with misleading reporting.\u00a0Both outlets\u00a0ultimately reached a legal settlement with Sandmann after he sued them in court for\u00a0$250 million. The defamation suit sought damages for the\u00a0\"emotional distress Nicholas and his family suffered\" in the fallout of the network's reporting -- and lawyers for Sandmann have said they will target other major outlets who reported on the story in the same way. An assistant professor and diversity scholar at Transylvania\u00a0Unversity, Avery Tompkins, shared a comment on the post before it was taken down, calling Sandmann's \u201cpublic behavior and rhetoric atrocious and uninformed,\" adding that the young student must accept his class as gospel, The National Review reported. \u201cWe can\u2019t not admit academically qualified students due to their political and personal views,\" he said. \"If he ends up in my Intro class, fine. He might learn something that is actually based on research and evidence.\" Tompkins added that Sandmann is part of groups that hold \u201canti-intellectualist views\u201d and would see the professor\u00a0\"as part of some liberal brainwashing machine, but signing up for Transy and my class means he is required to learn that information, even if he disagrees.\u201d The professor continued: \u201cIf he were to cause problems by being disruptive, trolling, or engaging in unethical behavior of any kind, I would immediately document it (just like I would for any student doing the same thing)\u2026and he would just be putting himself in a position for me to file a conduct report.\u201d Tompkins later issued an apology saying,\u00a0\u201cI want to apologize for my mistake in singling out a student and any misunderstandings that arose from that.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cOne of my favorite things about working at a liberal arts institution is that our community has diverse perspectives,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll students, faculty and staff are able to engage in civil discourse with those whose views may be different from their own, and to learn about those views in an academic setting. I value and support these conversations with students, and I know that students value these conversations with their peers as well.\u201d The university said in a statement to\u00a0National Review on Tuesday that it would be reviewing the situation and that \u201cTransylvania, like nearly every campus, is composed of those holding the full range of viewpoints.\u201d",

(Christine Stickelmeyer/TCAPP) Hundreds gathered Tuesday night singing worship songs and Ryan Bomberger, a pro-life advocate who was conceived in rape and\u00a0founded the Radiance Foundation, was the speaker. The event began at 6 p.m. as the Planned Parenthood\u00a0closed. The abortion facility, which has been measuring noise levels, alleges\u00a0the group's worship and speakers reached disruptive and intimidating levels, violating an ordinance\u00a0passed by the Spokane City Council in March, after TCAPP started conducting the services. The lawsuit claims police are not enforcing the law because they \"are on the side of the church.\" BLACK PRO-LIFE LEADERS PAN PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S SANGER DISAVOWAL: 'LIKE CHANGING THE NAME OF AUSCHWITZ' \u201cIt's really, really frustrating and should not be allowed to happen, when the laws are very clear in Washington state and the city of Spokane\u00a0about interference with health care facilities,\u201d Paul Dillon, vice president of public affairs for PPGWNI, told Crosscut. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unnerving for the patients at Planned Parenthood.\u201d However, the pastor said their once-a-month services begin when the abortion facility closes down, and he's said they will start the service later if that is the problem.

The pastor says Planned Parenthood filled the city council with pro-abortion members and passed the city ordinance, but his gathering has even lowered their decibels. The Planned Parenthood spokesman added that the hundreds who gather \"can call themselves whatever they want, [but] in no way, shape or form is this a church.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Church at Planned Parenthood is NOT a protest,\" TCAPP writes on its website, describing\u00a0itself as a\u00a0\"gathering of Christians for the worship of God and corporate prayer for repentance for this nation, repentance for the apathetic church, and repentance for our blood-guiltiness in this abortion holocaust.\" \"We don't do anything but pray, preach, and give,\" Peters said. TCAPP's next service is set to be held on August 18 with speaker Greg Locke, a Tennessee pastor. Planned Parenthood claims the service isn\u2019t protected under the First Amendment because of care provided by the facility. \u201cPatients who rely on Planned Parenthood for vital medical care have the same right as all Washingtonians to access health care without unreasonable disruption or interference,\u201d Kim Clark, Senior Staff Attorney for Legal Voice, told KREM. \u201cThis is more vital than ever in a global health pandemic that is disproportionately harming people of color \u2014 people who already face substantial obstacles to accessing healthcare.

            "article_content": "Senate Judiciary Committee chairman joins 'The Story' after the conclusion of Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings. This is a rush transcript from \u201cThe Story with Martha MacCallum \" October 15,\u00a0\u00a02020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum in\u00a0New York and this is \"The Story.\" Of an election that is now 19 days away.\u00a0It is October in every way, folks, and both sides are slugging it out.The Former Vice President ahead and double digits in the polls, meanwhile\u00a0the president continues to draw crowds in battleground states, and\u00a0Republicans claim that they have added 140,000 new voters to the rolls\u00a0through a massive registration effort nationwide.And now after the president's brief battle with COVID-19 at the beginning\u00a0of October, and October surprise for the Biden Campaign, reporting being\u00a0done by \"The New York Post\" puts the spotlight once again on the Biden\u00a0family finances.Purported emails and photos raise new questions about how the Biden's have\u00a0made their money during a lifetime in politics. And why Hunter Biden would\u00a0have actively sought business deals with countries with whom his father was\u00a0negotiating foreign policy as vice president at the time.And those countries were not the U.K., France or Italy. They were billion-dollar arrangements, reportedly, with Russia, Ukraine, and China. We have\u00a0known for some time that at least Hunter's Ukraine deals troubled the Obama\u00a0Administration.Then in a whole another side and layer to this story you've got Twitter and\u00a0Facebook blocking \"The New York Post\" stories they did actively again today\u00a0and these are ongoing investigative pieces and you can't find them on\u00a0Twitter or Facebook. So that's another element all of this.But first to break it all down here now is the person who was at the center\u00a0of all of this, the Former New York City Mayor and Attorney to the\u00a0President Rudy Giuliani. Mayor Giuliani, good to have you with us tonight\u00a0and thanks for being here.RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: Good to be with you,\u00a0Martha. How are you?MACCALLUM: I'm doing fine. Thank you.GIULIANI: Healthy?MACCALLUM: I'm healthy. I'm glad you are not coughing like last time and\u00a0you had a negative, so that's good news.GIULIANI: Oh, that created a heck of a thing.MACCALLUM: Yes, sure it did. All right, so I want to get to the origins of\u00a0all this in a moment but last time we talked about Ukraine.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: We showed the Ukraine emails and tonight I want to ask you some\u00a0questions about the China side of this story in particular.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: And what the deal was, as you understand it, that Hunter Biden\u00a0struck there that involved the State Bank of China run by the Communist\u00a0government there and explain the players in this deal and we have a full\u00a0screen here that shows one of the emails from James Gilliar, so explain to\u00a0people what you think was going on here.GIULIANI: We have two deals that I've analyzed in China and they are two\u00a0very big ones. One was the investment in the Hunter Biden, Chris Heinz, and\u00a0Bolger Private Equity Fund that was owned by the vice president's son, the\u00a0Secretary of State's stepson, and the nephew, believe it or not, of Bolger\u00a0and - is the name of it.And the Chinese government over a period of time through the Bank of China\u00a0committed $1.5 billion and became a partner. So essentially while Joe Biden\u00a0is vice president was negotiating with China and I might say getting his\u00a0head kicked in, contemporaries reports will tell you that, even \"The New\u00a0York Times\" he was losing on every point to China.His son, the Secretary of State's stepson, and the nephew to one of the\u00a0biggest organized criminals in America got a $1.5 billion commitment to\u00a0their totally useless private equity fund. At a time in which this - the\u00a0emails and the pictures and that will demonstrate that Hunter Biden was\u00a0seriously suffering from drug addiction.There's no doubt that China had all the pictures that I now have of him as\u00a0a drug addict. He was continuously a drug addict from 2014 until as\u00a0recently as 2020. He got kicked out - remember he got kicked out of the\u00a0navy after only two months.His father pulled all kinds of strings to get him in at 40. You usually get\u00a0in for some kind of specialty. They put him in public relations, hardly a\u00a0specialty. Within two months he couldn't stop taking crack cocaine. He\u00a0failed and his rebound was his father getting him the deal with Nicole\u00a0Zinoleesky who was one of the most crooked men in Ukraine. This China deal--MACCALLUM: OK. Go ahead.GIULIANI: This China deal happened when his father took him over on Air\u00a0Force 2. His father was going to try to negotiate with China to get them\u00a0out of the islands they were disputing with Japan. He failed to do that. In\u00a0fact they expanded their military presence there. But Joe came back with\u00a0nice, good words about China. He's the one who said China is not a threat,\u00a0China is not a competitor.MACCALLUM: All right.GIULIANI: He's the only man in the world who would say that. Was that\u00a0influenced by the fact that the son, who is a serious drug addicts, got\u00a0$1.5 billion in commitments from China? That's an extraordinary amount of\u00a0money--MACCALLUM: I want to put up a piece of email that you are talking about.\u00a0And just show everybody this email that this one was part of \"The New York\u00a0Post\" investigation that is all coming off of this laptop.And it says you know at the moment, they have a provisional agreement that\u00a0the equity will be distributed and it says 20 will go to H and it goes\u00a0through different initials, I suppose. There is one that says H I assume\u00a0that you believe that means Hunter. At the bottom it says 10 will be held\u00a0by H for the big guy. Tell me what this means?GIULIANI: You've got to guess who the big guy is? If you need any guessing\u00a0about who the big guy is all you have to do is take a look at the\u00a0arrangement made for the office of this business where the Chinese\u00a0Communist government was up partner.When the offices opened, Hunter Biden sends a memo in the first two people\u00a0he puts down to have keys to the office are Joe Biden and Jill Biden. So\u00a0Joe Biden and James Biden were all going to have offices with the\u00a0government of China essentially. This business we're talking about now is a\u00a0different one.MACCALLUM: Yes. Do you have evidence that this guy means Joe Biden? You\u00a0know just to lay it out quite clearly do you evidence that that is--GIULIANI: The only evidence - the only evidence I have right now is here it\u00a0says big guy and here it says that he's the first person to get a key in\u00a0the office that this business is going to occupy. We've got to put those\u00a0two things together. But I haven't finished yet with the hard drive. There\u00a0are some extraordinary things on it and I don't know.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this--GIULIANI: If I was in court I would put these two things together. There's\u00a0a certain amount of unbelievable, unbelievable expansion of reality that's\u00a0given to Biden. I mean, who would up about the big\" be?MACCALLUM: All right. Let me ask you one more thing because I thought this\u00a0is very interesting. I understand the point that you're trying to make.\u00a0This is a text message that I saw you talk about this morning, that you say\u00a0is from Hunter Biden to his daughter Naomi.And on this text message it says I love all of you but I don't receive any\u00a0respect and that's fine I guess works for you, apparently. I hope you all\u00a0can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30\u00a0years. It's really hard. But don't worries, unlike pop I won't make you\u00a0give me half your salary.Now this, obviously - I just want to point out that your main argument here\u00a0appears to be, not that there was a quid pro quo, that there was policy\u00a0impact from what he is doing, but that he was the moneymaker for the Biden\u00a0family and that is at the very least unethical in terms of the way the\u00a0money was being made, attaching himself to the his father the vice\u00a0president in order to get these deals and you're argument is that, that's\u00a0the only way--GIULIANI: No, not quite correct Martha.MACCALLUM: In what way?GIULIANI: No, it isn't. My argument as this is a racketeering case that\u00a0went on for 30 years. I mentioned 30 years a year ago probably on your\u00a0show. I said for 30 years the Biden family has been selling Joe's office to\u00a0the highest bidder.MACCALLUM: So let me ask you this, where did this text message come from?\u00a0This text message is not used in \"The New York Post\" investigation which is\u00a0based on the hard drive that you gave them.Also, people who claim that have concerns about the origin of this hard\u00a0drive and whether or not it's some form of Russian disinformation, which I\u00a0want you to reply to claim that there is no metadata attached to it?\u00a0There's no address on this text message, so prove to everybody right now\u00a0that this text message is legit. Can you?GIULIANI: Yes, I can. I mean, I can't right now I don't have the hard drive\u00a0with me but it comes right off the hard drive. \"The New York Post\" has\u00a0possession of it; they just elected not to publish it. Its right in the\u00a0hard drives those two messages. I don't know if you had the two messages\u00a0above it.MACCALLUM: We do, we have it on the screen right now.GIULIANI: His daughter's name. I mean, look, the hard drive will eventually\u00a0be out if it's not, put me in jail. I'm telling you it's on the hard drive.\u00a0That's where I took it from.MACCALLUM: How do you know the hard drive definitely belongs --?\u00a0GIULIANI: You think a Russians gave it to me?MACCALLUM: I am asking because there are all these questions that I know\u00a0you are aware of so I'm giving you a chance to--GIULIANI: --Martha they have been feeding us this garbage for years. This\u00a0isn't from Russia! Look, this is a deal, every witness told me existed.\u00a0Hunter just wrote it out for us. This is the deal that is outlined in the\u00a0first chapter of the book \"Secret Empire.\" This is the way that Chinese do\u00a0corruption. They don't pay the principal.\u00a0They paid the relatives so they don't have to file around him. This is what\u00a0Chinese Bank paid a billion dollars in fines for.MACCALLUM: Look, there is no doubt, none of this looks good and none of\u00a0this--GIULIANI: Of course it doesn't look good!MACCALLUM: --the way anybody should operate in relation to the Vice\u00a0President of the United States and a family member who is making money off\u00a0that position. I'm just merely asking to explain some of the origin so that\u00a0you can put to rest some of these things that are out there that are trying\u00a0to shoot down your evidence here.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: And I was just asking if you can identify them and answer for\u00a0that.GIULIANI: I can. The answer is it's on the hard drive. The hard drive will\u00a0eventually be examined by anybody who wants to examine it. I wouldn't\u00a0invite - you want to send somebody from Fox to my office? They can look at\u00a0this. They can look at the hard drive. I will show it to them tomorrow.MACCALLUM: OK.GIULIANI: I actually have it memorized as to exactly where it is on the\u00a0hard drive. I have to tell you, I've only been able to go through a third\u00a0of the hard drive. And my people have only been able to go through a third\u00a0even I think \"The Post\" has probably only gone through 20 percent of it.It's huge. And the reason I hate bringing up the fact that he's a drug\u00a0addict because I feel sorry for him as a drug addict. But there is\u00a0something really important about that. The first thing is it's a national\u00a0security risk. I mean, do you remember how the Democrats were all worried\u00a0that the Russians had all these bad tapes on Donald Trump?MACCALLUM: I sure do and you saw that all over Twitter. Nobody blocked any\u00a0of that.GIULIANI: And the Chinese have those tapes on Hunter Biden and Joe Biden's\u00a0family.\u00a0MACCALLUM: All right.GIULIANI: And the tapes are horrendous.MACCALLUM: We want to continue to being into this - go ahead.GIULIANI: They could squeeze Joe at anytime they want. They could squeeze\u00a0Joe with this anytime they want. The second transaction we are talking\u00a0about was actually, in my view, set up for the purpose of squeezing Joe\u00a0Biden because--MACCALLUM: All right, let me as you one last question from those who are\u00a0challenging this and that's on Andre--GIULIANI: Sure please.MACCALLUM: He has now been determined by investigation of the U.S. Treasury\u00a0Department to be a Russian agent who is waging a covert influence campaign\u00a0to affect the U.S. election by releasing information about purported Biden\u00a0wrongdoing. He someone that you spent several months with he's a former\u00a0member of the Ukraine parliament. What do you say to that?GIULIANI: Well, first of all, I didn't spend several months. I met with him\u00a0three times over three to four months. Second he gave me no relevant\u00a0information about Joe Biden. His information relates to $5.3 billion in\u00a0foreign aid that's missing in Ukraine, $3 billion of which is American,\u00a0which he alleges the Obama Administration covered up.It's already led to the prosecution of two people for embezzling about $140\u00a0million who were closely associated - he actually worked for George Soros.\u00a0He gave me no information on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden--MACCALLUM: So nothing connected to this at all?GIULIANI: He doesn't know about that case, zero, and zero.MACCALLUM: All right. Just wanted to ask you because that is some of the\u00a0reporting that is out there in reaction to this. We always go overtime\u00a0whenever we talk. I want you to come back so we can do this--GIULIANI: They are going to throw every piece of dirt they can Martha.MACCALLUM: Rudy Giuliani, thank you very much.GIULIANI: Every piece of dirt they can but I can take it.MACCALLUM: Yes, I know you can. Thank you very much, good to have you here\u00a0sir.GIULIANI: Sure.MACCALLUM: Good to see you. So with the hearings over now, President Trump\u00a0is confident today that his third Supreme Court pick will be confirmed and\u00a0Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham when \"The Story\" continues.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: It's not the law of Amy;\u00a0it's the law of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: We have the votes; those are the words of the Senate Majority\u00a0Leader Mitch McConnell as the hearing for the Supreme Court Nominee Judge\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett come to a conclusion. Today, the Judiciary Committee\u00a0heard from witnesses and then they set a date for their vote which is\u00a0October 22nd, 1 week from today. Democrats did continue to lambaste the\u00a0process, calling it a sham.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Not only do you have your own precedent, not\u00a0only do you have the example of Abraham Lincoln, but you have the fact that\u00a0because of what this president has been saying, it undermines this process,\u00a0undermines the court, and that is why we should delay.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Senator Klobuchar and Senator Harris before her both\u00a0pointed out the fact that Abraham Lincoln did not make a nomination in\u00a0those 27 days. What both of them omitted was that the Senate wasn't here.\u00a0This was not the age of communing every weekend, jumping on a united\u00a0flight. \"The Washington Post\" conclusion was that Senator Harris' argument\u00a0\"Wasn't exactly true.\"(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Joining me now is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey\u00a0Graham. Chairman Graham, good to have you with us today. I'm sure it's been\u00a0a long week for you.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.MACCALLUM: So thanks for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. I just want\u00a0to put up a moment between you and Senator Feinstein this morning hugging\u00a0it out on the way out the door as we take a look at that. Overall, she\u00a0commanded you on your handling of this across the board. How do you think\u00a0it went?GRAHAM: I think it went very well. Judge Barrett proved to the country any\u00a0fair-minded person she is qualified to be on the court. As to Senator\u00a0Feinstein she is going to vote against the nominee. She has opposed the\u00a0process at every turn.I respect her, she respects me. And the people criticizing her they are in\u00a0charge of the Democratic Party. In their world you can't even have mutual\u00a0respect, so it's mutual destruction. So I hope people understand that the\u00a0folks pushing the Democratic Party object to Senator Feinstein saying\u00a0something nice about me. God help us all if they get in control of the\u00a0government.MACCALLUM: You know there is occasionally a yearning for the cordiality\u00a0that used to exist in these forums and I think we saw a little bit of that\u00a0bubble up from Feinstein. But then there is a whole another side that seems\u00a0to want to dig in their heels and not go back there. I thought you said\u00a0something interesting, you said the qualification test to me seems to be\u00a0dead and buried with everybody but me. What did you mean by that?GARHAM: Well, I voted for Stoudemire (ph) and Kagan understanding they had\u00a0a different judicial philosophy. Justice Scalia got 97 votes, I think.\u00a0Justice Ginsburg got like, 96. They are polar opposites in terms of\u00a0judicial philosophy. It used to be in the Senate that you looked at\u00a0qualifications, understanding elections matter, but why is it always\u00a0conservative's elite, Thomas, Kavanaugh.So what I would say to my Democratic colleagues, I respect you, I want to\u00a0work with you but you try to destroy Judge Kavanaugh's life. I don't need\u00a0any lectures from Democrats on this Committee about fair.So I would love to do it differently. When it was my turn to be where you\u00a0are at I voted for Stoudemire and Kagan and how do we get repaid? You tried\u00a0to destroy Judge Kavanaugh. Here is the good news there was no Kavanaugh-like attacks on Judge Barrett. I think they've learned their lesson and I\u00a0hope this sets the tone for the future time will tell.MACCALLUM: That's what I was going to ask you because you know if - as we\u00a0all remember we were at this stage when the Kavanaugh allegations began.GRAHAM: Yes.MACCALLUM: Now you talk about October 22nd that 7 long days when everyone\u00a0looks at this process and says it was handled well. Do you sense that there\u00a0is anything in the works to try to gum up this vote?GRAHAM: I don't know but after the Kavanaugh experience I don't sleep well\u00a0at night. I sleep with one eye open. There are groups out there who are\u00a0attacking Senator Feinstein for just showing common courtesy to me. Only\u00a0God knows what they would do?I can tell you this, when it comes to this election cycle, Democrats have\u00a0raised about $400 million since the passing of Justice Ginsburg to destroy\u00a0people like me. My opponent raise $57 million because I dare stood up for\u00a0Kavanaugh and I'm trying to help Trump.I've got Amy's back and she\u00a0needs to have my back that there is a lot at stake here. So they are trying\u00a0to gin up Democrats to destroy this fine nominee in Judge Barrett. They do\u00a0so at their own peril. If Senator Schumer and this crowd do this again I\u00a0think it will blow up in their face even worse than Kavanaugh.MACCALLUM: Yep. You know that's what I wonder. I mean, there's definitely a\u00a0political assessment to be made, whether or not it's worth it?GRAHAM: yes.MACCALLUM: And there were indications that it was politically a mistake.\u00a0When you look at the polls in South Carolina and you just mentioned you\u00a0were in a tight race. I think your opponent has raised $20 million more\u00a0than the highest racing Senate candidate which was Beto O'Rourke before\u00a0that.So there's a ton of money going into this race to end your time in\u00a0Washington, but look at this, in South Carolina, 52 percent support Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett, 30 percent oppose and 17 percent apparently, I don't know,\u00a0doesn't know or hasn't decided after the course of this week. Do you think\u00a0this has a positive impact on your campaign overall? The latest numbers I\u00a0saw for you are up a 6.GRAHAM: Oh, my God, does this have a positive impact for me, yes\u00a0absolutely. Thank you President Trump for nominating a qualified\u00a0conservative pro-life unashamedly religious woman who has the\u00a0qualifications and the disposition for the court, to all the young women of\u00a0the world wondering is it OK to be pro-life? If it is OK to embrace your\u00a0faith, the answer is yes.This is a historic moment for the country to have somebody like Justice\u00a0Barrett to go on the court but when it comes to South Carolina, we want\u00a0conservative judges, we don't want liberal judges. Judge Barrett will play\u00a0very well in South Carolina and I think she's playing very well throughout\u00a0the country. She is unashamedly religious but she will not impose your\u00a0religion on you or me.She is going to view the law through the lens of an originalist, which\u00a0should be comforting to everybody. She will not be a legislator in a robe.\u00a0She will apply the lot of the facts and we should all be pleased. But\u00a0finally, to all the young women, there's a place at the table for you.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I heard you say that a couple times through the course of these\u00a0proceedings and I think that it was heard across the country by a lot of\u00a0young women who may be sometimes feel like they are shut out of the\u00a0conversation and it's not OK to feel the way that they feel.And of course everyone should have the freedom to say and think what they\u00a0feel and be able to have friendships on both sides of that equation. So\u00a0let's play this, just a quick moment from you today and I want to get your\u00a0thoughts on it before we say goodbye.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAHAM: You all have a good chance of winning the White House. I don't know\u00a0where the polls are going to be?SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Thank you for acknowledging that.GRAHAM: Yes, I think it's true.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So what you think of this race? 19 days to go, it sounds like\u00a0you like it could - you sound like it could go Biden's direction.GRAHAM: Well, here is what I think. I think President Trump is going to win\u00a0because the people who are trying to destroy Dianne Feinstein's well lived\u00a0life because she gave me a hug are driving the Democratic Party to pat\u00a0court, add more justices beyond nine to make it liberal, to change the\u00a0rules of the Senate, to do away with Electoral College.The most radical agenda in modern political history is being pushed. I\u00a0think that's why think President Trump is going to win. I know that's why\u00a0he's going to win in South Carolina. I know that's why I'm going to win. So\u00a0yes, is it close? Close but I like the way this race is trending. President\u00a0Trump is coming on at a time that matters. And President Trump you got to\u00a0hell of a first term and talk more about it.MACCALLUM: Senator Lindsey Graham thank you very much sir. Good to see you\u00a0tonight.GRAHAM: Thank you.MACCALLUM: 19 more days, that is how long undecided voters have to make\u00a0their choice for president. We are going to talk to three of them from\u00a0three battleground states after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Two of the big stories dominating the campaign trail this week\u00a0Hunter Biden's e-mail revelations, purported e-mail revelations that we\u00a0were just talking to the former mayor of New York about and also the big\u00a0hearings that dominated this week for Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the\u00a0Supreme Court.\u00a0Both of them unfolding just two weeks since the president confirmed his\u00a0COVID diagnosis which surprised a lot of people and made a lot of news.\u00a0Here now on how all of this can play out over the next 19 days. Three\u00a0undecided voters from crucial battleground states. We have Christopher\u00a0Formoso of Florida, a financial analyst -- analysis manager who voted for\u00a0Gary Johnson back in 2016. He is a registered Republican.\u00a0Caitlin Singleton, Democrat from Wisconsin, is a rental housing site\u00a0manager, mom of three, she voted for Hillary Clinton last time around. And\u00a0Andrew Rodney of Michigan, COO of a plastic manufacturing company. He voted\u00a0for Gary Johnson in 2016. And he is an independent.\u00a0Thank you so much for all of you for being here tonight. Caitlin, you spoke\u00a0with us several weeks back and so since the last time we spoke, a lot of\u00a0things have happened and one of the biggest stories as I said this week has\u00a0been hearings for Amy Coney Barrett. Did you watch them and did they have\u00a0any influence on how you are thinking now?\u00a0CAITLIN SINGLETON, UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTER: Yes, so I did watch them. I\u00a0taped them and watch them when my kids went to bed, all of the hearings. I\u00a0don't think they necessarily had an impact on how I will be voting. I'm\u00a0still undecided at this point. You know, I was hoping the debate would\u00a0clear that up for me. They did not. I'm crossing my fingers that the next\u00a0debate coming up will clear it up for me as time is definitely taking now.\u00a0I have mixed feelings about the hearing. I support the appointee, I think\u00a0she's incredibly skilled, I think that was very evident in the hearing, I\u00a0am also a Catholic and pro-life so I do -- those personal aspects resonate\u00a0with me.\u00a0I have mixed feelings about the process though, and the double standards\u00a0that I've kind of seen from what happened the last time around with the --\u00a0with Garland. So, I have mixed feelings about it. I do support the\u00a0appointee the SCOTUS appointee, though, and it does not have any impact on\u00a0my voting. Yes.MACCALLUM: OK. Christopher, what is playing large in your mind as you look\u00a0at some of these big stories lately?\u00a0CHRISTOPHER FORMOSO, UNDECIDED FLORIDA VOTER: Well, with ACB, I think she's\u00a0a fantastic woman, she has more character than anyone probably in this\u00a0country. She adopted two kids from a third world country, gave them a great\u00a0life here in Haiti. My wife used to serve in Haiti and I've heard stories\u00a0of how rough it is there.And the fact that she's -- just treated kind of ported back is expected.\u00a0But the packing of the court, that is absurd. One of the three major powers\u00a0of this country, and what's going to happen when a presidential -- a\u00a0Republican becomes president down the road? They are going to repack it?\u00a0They are going to have like 100 judges at one point to keep getting power,\u00a0it's ridiculous.\u00a0MACCALLUM: It's a good point. Andrew, what about you, with the news that\u00a0you are hearing and the things that are the input for your decision? How is\u00a0that all playing out right now?\u00a0ANDREW RODNEY, UNDECIDED MICHIGAN VOTER: It's a lot of noise. You know,\u00a0it's just that they are just shoving everything at you now and attacking\u00a0everybody. But Amy Coney Barrett, I, again, high character. She doesn't\u00a0have a lot of legal experience but she's going to get appointed, so move\u00a0on. It would be great if the Senate could do, you know, more effective\u00a0business than just have this political theater.\u00a0So, and that's how a lot of this feels. The debates were certainly\u00a0disappointing. Trump just embarrassed himself, and Biden didn't really\u00a0bring anything new. So, I think and the Hunter Biden revelation is, you\u00a0know, is nothing new. This is the way it's been, influence peddling.\u00a0But, so, no real change in my perspective except probably more disenchanted\u00a0with Trump. But Biden has done nothing at all except make himself look --\u00a0you know, make Trump look worse. That's about it. So, it's a disappointing\u00a0election. We need to fix the political system that's causing this cancer to\u00a0our country.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So how do you think you'll vote if you had to vote today,\u00a0Andrew, work what would you do?\u00a0RODENY: I'm probably leaning to vote for a third-party candidate for the\u00a0libertarian party or writing somebody and, actually, and then I worry about\u00a0Democrats taking full control of the entire government. So, I might vote\u00a0for a Republican Senate campaign -- candidate, for the sake of avoiding\u00a0that.\u00a0And our House candidates. I'm uncertain. You know, to be honest and a lot\u00a0of elections, I don't vote. If I don't know somebody, I don't know their\u00a0background or anything, I don't vote.MACCALLUM: Yes.RODNEY: And I wish that more people who didn't really understand the\u00a0details wouldn't vote. It's like Amy Coney Barrett. You know, if you are\u00a0not a legal expert, you don't know the background of those things, to sit\u00a0there and express your opinion, it's good for people to know but let the\u00a0more important people in the position. So.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I thought it was a good education and a lot of that, just\u00a0listening to it over the course of this week. And she's a, you know, a\u00a0circuit court judge for three years so she does have quite a bit of\u00a0experience and also as a legal professor.\u00a0Caitlin, tell me about Wisconsin right now. How do you think, what's your\u00a0feel for which way Wisconsin might be leaning?\u00a0SINGLETON: You know, it's hard to tell. Where I'm at, in Middleton, there\u00a0are -- I don't see a single Trump sign. Maybe one or two. Everything is\u00a0Biden. One thing I'm noticing that's very different from the last year or\u00a0the last election, I should say, in 2016, is when I go through rural\u00a0Wisconsin, I'm seeing a lot of Biden signs on farms, and in 2016 that was\u00a0all Trump.\u00a0MACCALLUM: That's right.SINGLETON: So, that is definitely a change, although you go to different\u00a0counties and it's all Trump. So, it's really hard to tell. It's hard to\u00a0tell.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Before, just real quickly, Christopher, just about 20 seconds,\u00a0what's your feel for Florida?\u00a0FORMOSO: I think Trump is going to win it. We're -- I think Cuban American\u00a0population, I'm a first-generation Cuban-American. We feel proud of this\u00a0country. The Democrats seem to hate this country. I think it's an\u00a0impressive country for us. We are all minorities and we made it to this\u00a0country, so I think it's going to be Trump in Florida.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Great to have all of you with us. Thank you for sharing your\u00a0viewpoints this evening and for being here. Thank you all.\u00a0RODNEY: Thank you for having us.SINGLETON: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Twenty days to go. All right. So, chairman Ron Johnson of the\u00a0committee now investigating these alleged Biden e-mails. He is coming up.\u00a0His committee also looked into this, so we'll see what he thinks now.And next, Dr. Shelby Steele as cancel culture strikes his new documentary\u00a0exploring race relations in America. Glad to have him back on the show. He\u00a0is next.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHELBY STEELE, FILMMAKER: Absolutely, race played a significant part of the\u00a0reaction.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened in Ferguson was more about America, the\u00a0very same America that would explode in 2020.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Writer and filmmaker Shelby Steele is focused on race in America\u00a0for decades. He has a bold voice that is not always welcome in the current\u00a0BLM dominant look at the root causes of the conditions of black lives in\u00a0our country today, so the subject of the new film is an event that sparked\u00a0enormous controversy over what happened and what did not happened in the\u00a0shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.\u00a0As you look at this trailer, keep in mind that Amazon, which is owned by\u00a0Jeff Bezos which also owns the Washington Post, has declined to stream this\u00a0movie on their platforms, a move that the Wall Street Journal editorial\u00a0board is now decrying. Writing, quote, \"by canceling important dissenting\u00a0voices like Steeles on such a vital subject, Amazon is inviting a political\u00a0backlash.\" Watch this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened in Ferguson was more about America, the\u00a0very same America that would explode in 2020. Where every black was George\u00a0Floyd and every cop was Derek Chauvin.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can do better next time by doing the right thing.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since the '60s whites have lived under the accusation\u00a0that they are racist.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Ferguson really became a destination for successful\u00a0African Americans.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were not part of white flight. No.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some people want to be angry at someone. Michael Brown\u00a0had tried to buy cigarillos the night before with pot.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He put his hands on the earth, but the officer still\u00a0approached with his weapons drawn and he fired seven more shots.\u00a0GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: Some witnesses have also\u00a0said that they actually saw you stand over him.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not being correct.STEPHANOPOULOS: What did you see in that face?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Aggression, there was nothing. It was like hollow just\u00a0looking through me.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What demons might have been at work within him and to\u00a0make the final fateful charge against Officer Wilson.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: Joining me now, the film's writer and narrator Dr. Shelby\u00a0Steele, a senior Hoover fellow on race relations. Good to have you with us\u00a0as always, Shelby. Thank you very much for coming back.\u00a0You received an e-mail --STEELE: Thanks for having me.MACCALLUM: -- that said that your title doesn't meet prime videos content\u00a0quality expectations, not eligible for publishing on the service and we\u00a0won't be accepting a resubmission of this title so don't try to come back\u00a0around again. What do you think about all this, sir?\u00a0STEELE: I think what they are saying really when it's all over with is they\u00a0are saying dare to look at blacks in America as something as human beings\u00a0rather than as victims. And we are invested as this huge massive\u00a0corporation in the political correctness of seeing blacks as victims.\u00a0You see them as more complex than that and that's intolerable. We are going\u00a0to, no matter what you do, we're going to insist that they remain in the\u00a0American, sort of cultural world. We are going to make sure that they\u00a0continue to be seen as victims who are old things.\u00a0I like to say Amazon, this is one of a classic example of white guilt\u00a0coming out, and I now can claim to be a victim of white guilt.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I want to play another piece --\u00a0(CROSSTALK)STEELE: So, I can waive -- I can waive my flag and ask for redress too.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I want to play another piece of this that may have also, you\u00a0know, provoked to this action. Listen to this part of the documentary.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0STEELE: Perhaps the most insidious feature of liberalism after the 1960s is\u00a0that it dismisses individual responsibility as an agent of black uplift.\u00a0Problems are always the fault of a systemic enemy, like racism.\u00a0Let's ask a daring question. One that a group like Black Lives Matter would\u00a0forbid. Is Michael Brown in any way responsible for his own death?\u00a0Liberalism invisibilizes (ph) all of black America. It leaps over our\u00a0actual problems to highlight racism as the source of all our ills.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: I mean, in 2020 those are very strong words. And in many\u00a0corners, they don't go down well. Kamala Harris had tweeted about the\u00a0murder of Michael Brown at one point and the Washington Post gave that four\u00a0Pinocchio's. You know, you had school children across America doing hands\u00a0up, don't shoot exercises and you are undercutting and shedding light on\u00a0that in a different way, sir.\u00a0STEELE: All of these incidents, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Michael\u00a0Brown, the fascination with them again is that -- here's the idea of blacks\u00a0being victimized by whites. That is an -- that is our avenues as a\u00a0minority. That's our avenue to entitlement, to power.\u00a0Our power in American life as blacks is in our victimization. We haven't\u00a0invented the computer, we didn't do a number of other things, we are,\u00a0though, victims of American evil. And that gives us a moral authority that\u00a0constitutes raw power. And we'll do anything to protect it, and we then use\u00a0that power to shakedown institutions like Amazon, who need are in premature\u00a0in order for their brand to seem to be innocent of racism, so it's a\u00a0symbiotic sort of problem that we -- that then all of America has to deal\u00a0with.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Well, I think, you know, people should know that Reverend Al\u00a0Sharpton is in this documentary, the NAACP. There's a lot of different\u00a0viewpoints presented here and --STEELE: Yes.MACCALLUM: -- it is called what killed Michael Brown. Dr. Shelby Steele,\u00a0thank you very much for bringing it to us and we look forward to talking to\u00a0you again soon. Thank you, sir.\u00a0STEELE: Thank you.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Chairman Ron Johnson on the plan to investigate a brand-new\u00a0trove of alleged Hunter Biden documents and a new Washington Post story\u00a0about this just coming out tonight after this.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Minutes after our interview with President Trump's attorney Rudy\u00a0Giuliani about his involvement in these Hunter Biden e-mails, the\u00a0Washington Post has now reported tonight that the White House was warned\u00a0last year that Giuliani, quote, \"was being used to feed Russian\u00a0misinformation to the president.\"\u00a0Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson has been very\u00a0deeply involved in this whole issue as well, and he joins me now. Senator,\u00a0thank you very much for being here tonight. Are you aware of those reports?\u00a0The report is that Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser went to\u00a0the president and said that he had information from our intelligence\u00a0services that Rudy Giuliani was possibly the target of being fed some of\u00a0this Russian information? Are you aware of those?\u00a0SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): I'm aware that Russia continues to try to\u00a0influence and interfere in our election, there's no doubt about that. I'm\u00a0also aware that Democrats created a false intelligence product falsely\u00a0accusing Chuck Grassley and I of accepting Russian disinformation which we\u00a0did not do from that same individual, Andrii Derkach. We didn't know who\u00a0the guy was, had not accepted any information. So, I also know there's a\u00a0fair amount of falsely allegations being thrown around this issue as well.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So, you know, this whole story and we didn't even get into this\u00a0part of it with Rudy Giuliani but this guy who owns a computer store who\u00a0claims that Hunter Biden dropped off his laptop there and he was concerned\u00a0about it, it was left there indefinitely so he then basically owned the\u00a0laptop under an agreement. And that laptop information was also sent to\u00a0your office, why didn't you bring this story out? Did you have concerns\u00a0about the nature of this information?\u00a0JOHNSON: Well, we were contacted by the whistleblower, normally I wouldn't\u00a0even be talking about this because we maintain the anonymity of\u00a0whistleblowers, but the day after we issued our reports we were contacted\u00a0by the whistleblower. We talked to the individual and you know, we started\u00a0our due diligence process of validating and verifying the information he\u00a0provided to us.\u00a0One of the steps we took is we reached out to the FBI, and it took them\u00a0over a week to get back to us and basically give us no response. Now, in\u00a0public reporting we know the FBI apparently obtained this computer through\u00a0a warrant or through a subpoena in December of 2019 and I think the FBI has\u00a0to come clean in terms of did they receive this, have they done forensics\u00a0on this computer, what did they know about it?Have they tracked this town? Have they investigated this? Have they gone\u00a0and tried to verify some of these e-mails? In other words, were the\u00a0recipients or the senders -- or the senders, have they verified that these\u00a0are true e-mails, are these true photos, true videos?\u00a0The FBI had this in December of 2019 right in the midst of the whole\u00a0impeachment process, there might be information relevant to our\u00a0investigation, there might have been information relevant to the\u00a0impeachment. If the FBI just sat on this computer and did nothing with it,\u00a0they need to explain to us why, but they also need to explain to us what\u00a0they did with it.\u00a0This is important information for the American public to sift and sort\u00a0through.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes, absolutely. I mean, absolutely, it is. And I think people\u00a0need to know whether or not this is a, you know, whether they verified, did\u00a0the FBI verified, whether or not this laptop ever actually belongs to\u00a0Hunter Biden. I mean, that's a very basic thing that I would imagine they\u00a0would be able to figure out, so we need to go through this every step of\u00a0the way and determine whether or not this information is verifiable.\u00a0Very quick thought, I got to go in about 20 seconds, Senator.JOHNSON No, they do. And this isn't a normal criminal investigation where\u00a0if they investigate somebody and they find nothing they completely -- they\u00a0completely keep that confidential. This is wrongdoing in the political\u00a0realm and the American public really deserve to know the truth.\u00a0(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: We need to know one way or the other. Absolutely. Senator, thank\u00a0you very much, sir, you're so great tonight. Senator Ron Johnson.JOHNSON: Have a good night.MACCALLUM: More of The Story right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: That is The Story of this Thursday night, October 15th, 2020.\u00a0But as always, The Story continues so we will be back here with you\u00a0tomorrow at seven o'clock.

As the Democratic National Convention is officially\u00a0underway, next week's Republican National Convention is beginning to reveal its own lineup of speakers. Fox News confirmed late Monday night that former Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, combat veteran and Pennsylvania congressional candidate Sean Parnell, and former Planned Parenthood director-turned-pro-life advocate Abby Johnson are all slated to appear within the four-day GOP event. Also scheduled to make remarks at the RNC are Andrew Pollack, the father of Parkland shooting victim Meadow Pollack and school safety advocate, and\u00a0Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the armed St. Louis couple that went viral earlier this summer for protecting their house from protesters who broke into their gated neighborhood. WASHINGTON POST SETTLES NICHOLAS SANDMANN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT IN COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CONTROVERSY Sandmann was swept up in a controversy back in 2019 after a video clip depicted the \"MAGA\" hat-wearing student smiling at Native American elder Nathan Phillips beating a drum and singing a chant as he was surrounded by Sandmann's peers, who all had joined in on the chant in front of the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. However, several mainstream media outlets\u00a0portrayed the incident with Sandmann and the other teens as being racially charged before additional footage later showed that a group of\u00a0Black Hebrew Israelites had provoked the confrontation, slinging racial slurs at the students\u00a0as they were waiting for their bus following the March For Life event. Both CNN and The Washington Post settled defamation lawsuits with the Covington teen.

The Miami Herald published an article on Sunday defending Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., from comparisons to Hillary Clinton, after the hashtag\u00a0#BlackHillary began trending on social media. The story cited tweets from former TV anchor Megyn Kelly and actor James Woods which criticized Harris for making faces during the debate against Vice President Mike Pence, with Woods referring to her as a \"Valley Girl,\" who rolled \"her eyes like a petulant brat.\" The article then cited\u00a0Ohio Pastor Darrell C.

He referred to the California Democrat as,\u00a0\u201cHillary Clinton in blackface,\" and the #BlackHillary hashtag began to spread.

Music mogul Kanye West has spent nearly $6 million for his eleventh-hour bid to enter the 2020 presidential race, according to campaign finance numbers filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission. West, 43, has personally loaned his campaign $6.7 million, the documents said. The West campaign has spent $5.86 million on operating expenses during his candidacy. JUDGE BARS KANYE WEST FROM APPEARING ON ARIZONA BALLOT Aside from West\u2019s loan, the campaign has received roughly $11,000 in donor contributions. The campaign had just over $900,000 in cash on hand at the end of the reporting period on Aug. 31. West revealed in July that he would run for president on behalf of what he called the \u201cBirthday Party.\u201d He previously identified as a supporter of President Trump and met with him in the Oval Office in Oct. 19. In a July interview with Forbes, West said he was \u201ctaking the red hat off\u201d and was no longer a Trump supporter. Democrats claim that West\u2019s presidential run is a bid to siphon votes from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The status of the West campaign was in doubt after it missed a key filing deadline with the FEC last month. While West has made the ballot in several states, others, including Virginia and Arizona, have blocked his candidacy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

The National Rifle Association\u2019s election spending is way down in 2020, filings show, as the organization fights scandals and now a lawsuit from New York state\u2019s attorney general to shut it down. The lost funding may hurt pro-gun-rights candidates in 2020, from President Trump all the way down the ballot. NRA FIGHTS BACK, FILES ITS OWN SUIT AGAINST NY ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING TO DISBAND ORGANIZATION According to the NRA\u2019s most recent filings, it has spent less than $1 million in the 2020 election cycle \u2013 a fraction of the over $8 million spent at this point in the 2016 campaign, according to tallies compiled by campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.org. While the NRA has promised to spend \u201ctens of millions\u201d more in 2020, it has not committed to matching 2016 spending. In 2016, the NRA spent $54 million backing Republican candidates. But this year, the NRA-ILA's executive director told The Washington Free Beacon, \"We'll spend tens of millions of dollars. Will it be $50 million? I don't know.\" The NRA\u2019s reduced political spending comes after years of costly legal battles surrounding alleged improper spending by NRA officials, in particular Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre. He has been accused of spending hundreds of thousands of the NRA\u2019s money on lavish personal expenses, as well as millions on private jet trips. LaPierre estimated that legal challenges over the last couple years did $100 million of damage to the NRA, according to January 2020 leaked audio of an NRA meeting obtained by NPR. Since then, the NRA\u2019s legal troubles have gotten worse, as New York Attorney General Letitia James announced last week that she is suing to shut down the NRA. In a statement, NRA President Carolyn Meadows called the lawsuit \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201ca transparent attempt to score political points and attack the leading voice in opposition to the leftist agenda.\u201d While a candidate for attorney general in 2018, James called the NRA a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d for enabling \u201cgun violence.\u201d The NRA has now countersued her, alleging a politically motivated prosecution. D.C.\u2019s attorney general is also suing the NRA \u2013 and the many lawsuits tie up NRA resources just as the organization needs what it has to support pro-gun-rights candidates in the 2020 election. \u201cYou could have set your watch by it: the investigation was going to reach its crescendo as we move into the 2020 election cycle,\u201d Meadows said in a statement. In addition to cutting 2020 campaign spending, the organization has gone through mass staff layoffs and pay cuts. COVID-19 added further to the NRA\u2019s challenges \u2013 the organization estimates that it lost $10 million to $15 million in revenue because of canceled fundraising events. But the NRA says they will still increase 2020 political spending soon. \u201cNo one should ever doubt that the NRA will make sure the voices of our tens of millions of members and supporters are heard,\u201d NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide told Fox News. NEW YORK AG SEEKS TO DISSOLVE NRA IN NEW LAWSUIT Leaders of competing gun-rights groups say they worry because, while the NRA is besieged, groups supporting gun control are upping their spending. \u201cThe real reason I am worried about the 2020 elections is the millions of dollars being sent by anti-gun rights billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and George Soros,\u201d Alan Gottlieb, president of the Second Amendment Foundation, told Fox News. In 2020 so far, gun-control groups have outspent all gun-rights groups, doling out $2.2 million, according to tallies compiled by OpenSecrets.org. \u201cIt is very hard for gun rights groups to compete. They [big gun-control donors] write six- and seven-figure checks and we rely on $15 and $25 donations from hundreds of thousands of working-class Americans,\u201d Gottlieb said. The Second Amendment Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3), which means it can\u2019t support or oppose political candidates like the NRA can. So far, no organization has picked up the mantle from the NRA in doing the kind of major political campaign spending that it once did. The hopes of gun-rights advocates now depend on rank-and-file gun owners. \u201cIn the past few months, there have been almost three million new gun buyers, and ten million guns sold overall,\u201d Erich Pratt, senior vice president for Gun Owners of America, a gun-rights group, told Fox News. \u201cThe three million new gun owners now have a different outlook when going to the polls,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cConsider that voters in Staunton, Va., a city that voted for Obama twice and for Hillary, recently defeated every Democrat office-holder running for reelection. A pro-gun tidal wave could be cresting.\u201d The NRA also revealed that it has added 1,000 new members each day since June, as millions of Americans became new gun owners in a period of large-scale unrest and riots in some cities following the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis while in police custody. \u201cWe've got a massive grassroots army, a massive grassroots army,\" Jason Ouimet, NRA-ILA's executive director, has said. Other gun-rights leaders were more skeptical and said gun owners were increasingly shunning the NRA. \u201cWe at the Second Amendment Foundation have seen a very large number of NRA members become first-time SAF supporters, switching their support,\u201d Gottlieb said. He attributed that to the allegations against NRA leadership. \u201cWhile there is no doubt both of these attorney generals ... have an ax to grind, these are serious allegations that have not been put to bed by the leadership of the NRA over the last several years,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately for the gun rights movement ... NRA members will not abandon the fight to protect Second Amendment rights,\u201d Gottlieb added. He called for members to themselves donate to candidates who support gun rights. \u201cOur members, as well as NRA members, can directly get involved as individuals in campaigns... they are doing that in record numbers,\u201d Gottlieb said.

The court ruled 5-4 in the case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, with Chief Justice John Roberts once again casting a deciding vote by siding with the court's liberal justices. The opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, noted that the Louisiana law is \"almost word-for-word identical\" to a Texas law the court ruled was unconstitutional in 2016's\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. A District Court had rejected the Louisiana law because of that precedent, but a court of appeals ruled otherwise. Ingraham said Roberts' decisions have \"run\u00a0the gamut from bad to worse,\u201d such as when he voted to uphold ObamaCare. Ingraham also said that Roberts and Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch decided to \u201crewrite the 1964 Civil Rights Act\u201d to include gender identity and sexuality as protected classes.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cLiterally, inventing a justification for that law that Congress never even cited. Then, in 2019, Roberts joined liberals to block the inclusion of a citizenship question on a census. Not because he thought it was illegal, but only because he disagreed with President Trump\u2019s motivations,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cRoberts was the swing vote with the court's Democrat nominees to uphold the clearly unconstitutional DACA program. So, President Trump now has 200 judges confirmed and he\u2019s put two solid conservatives on the court, but, we\u2019re still paying for President Bush\u2019s big mistake and we\u2019re paying for his big mistake in trusting Roberts to apply the law as written. Now, Roberts is kind of like a judicial Joe Biden, he\u2019s a man who quickly abandons the ideas on which he based his career to adopt positions designed to reach a political result.\u201d",

Trump tweeted the message Wednesday, along with an accusation that Biden \u2013\u00a0along with left-wing radicals \u2013\u00a0are in favor of abolishing institutions, including police, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0and\u00a0the Second Amendment.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The task force's recommendations include a statement that \"Democrats support eliminating the use of cash bail,\" as well as a promise\u00a0to change immigration enforcement policies, and a desire to \"reimagine policing.\" Biden has not called for repealing the Second Amendment, but his platform does include a variety of new gun control measures. The claim that Biden wishes to abolish suburbs echoes a recent piece by Stanley Kurtz in the National Review, in which Kurtz warns against the possibility that Biden would eliminate suburban zoning practices he considers \"exclusionary\" by threatening to withhold federal dollars. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden, meanwhile, has been attacking Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, calling him \"the worst possible person to lead us through this moment,\" and saying that \"unlike this president, I'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. Not silence them.\" Fox News' Charles Creitz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Rapper Kanye West did not submit any of the 10,000 signatures he needed by noon Monday to get on the ballot in South Carolina for the presidential election, according to a state election official, despite holding a rally in the state one day before. Last week, West successfully got his name on the ballot as an independent in Oklahoma, where only a $35,000 filing fee is required. On Saturday, he tweeted a number of locations where supporters could sign the petition to have his name on the ballot. KANYE WEST WILL APPEAR ON OKLAHOMA'S BALLOT AS AN INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, ELECTION BOARD SAYS But by the noon deadline, neither West nor any representative had shown up to\u00a0deliver the petition to the South Carolina Election Commission,\u00a0commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told Fox News. In order to appear on the ballot in the Palmetto State, West would have to receive the nomination of one of 10 political parties certified in South Carolina.\u00a0He had previously announced that he would be running as a candidate under the self-created \"Birthday Party.\" WEST GETS EMOTIONAL ON PRO-LIFE CAUSE AT FREEWHEELING EVENT:'NO MORE PLAN B. PLAN A' In his first event since declaring himself a presidential candidate, West delivered an emotional monologue in Charleston, S.C., on Sunday, denouncing abortion and voicing controversial views about abolitionist Harriet Tubman. \"No more Plan B \u2014 Plan A,\" he said to a mixed response from the audience about the emergency contraceptive that helps prevent pregnancy within 72 hours of unprotected sex. West said that while he believed abortion should be legal, financial incentives to help struggling mothers could be a way to discourage the practice. \u201cEverybody that has a baby gets a million dollars,\u201d he said as an example. Speaking without a microphone, West became tearful while talking about abortion, about his mother, who died following plastic surgery complications in 2007, and about his wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian West. \"Even if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world even when I didn\u2019t want to. She stood up and she protected that child. You know who else protected a child? Forty-three years ago, who do you think protected a child?\u201d West said crying. \"My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy,\" he said. His rambling speech went from religion to international trade and licensing deals. \u201cHarriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had them work for other White people,\u201d he said, apparently trying to make a bigger point about race and advantages. One crowd member right afterward groaned, \u201cCome on, man,\u201d while a woman could be heard saying, \u201cOK, we\u2019re leaving now.\u201d West initially shared his dreams of being the third candidate to run against President Trump and Joe Biden in a tweet on the Fourth of July. \"We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION,\" he said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Days later, West conducted a lengthy interview with Forbes in which he declared he no longer supported Trump and said that Biden was not \"special.\" Fox News' Andrew Craft, Frank Miles and Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee says the CEOS of Facebook and Twitter 'were caught with their hands in the cookie jar' when they struggled to name a single liberal who has been censored on their platforms. On August 30, 2019, Facebook notified Lila Rose, the president of the pro-life group Live Action, that an independent fact-checker had rated two of her group\u2019s videos as \u201cfalse.\u201d Facebook said it would therefore suppress the videos and notify all users who shared the videos that they had shared \u201cfalse news.\u201d The videos suppressed by Facebook claimed that \u201cabortion is never medically necessary\u201d \u2014 a claim that two pro-abortion activists said had been labeled as \u201cfalse\u201d by a group called \u201cScience Feedback.\u201d After The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists came to Live Action\u2019s defense, writing that fact-checkers \u201care in error to claim that elective abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother,\u201d Facebook removed the \u201cfalse\u201d label from the videos and stopped suppressing their distribution. ADONIS HOFFMAN: BIG TECH SENATE HEARING WINNERS AND LOSERS Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since admitted his company was wrong to suppress Live Action\u2019s content and Facebook has changed the way it fact-checks content on its platform. But the suppression of conservative voices continues. Just last month, Facebook banned pro-life ads from Susan B. Anthony List exposing former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s support for late-term abortion, this time relying on a \u201cfact-check\u201d from The Dispatch, a self-appointed fact-check organization. The Dispatch eventually retracted its fact-check, admitting it was completely wrong, and Facebook then reinstated the ads. It is encouraging that Facebook admitted its fact-checkers were wrong and eventually stopped suppressing conservative ideas in both these examples, but why does this always seem to happen in just one direction? On Wednesday I had an opportunity to ask the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter to name one example of their companies suppressing a\u00a0high-profile liberal person or group, including pro-abortion groups like Planned Parenthood, NARAL, or Emily\u2019s List. The Twitter and Facebook CEOs completely failed to name one example. Considering how biased the employees of these Big Tech companies are, the constant suppression of conservative ideas is not surprising. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This election cycle 92.83% of the money Facebook employees gave to federal candidates went to Democrats, and just 7.17% to Republicans. If you think that is slanted, Twitter is even worse.\u00a0 This election cycle 99.3% of the money Twitter employees gave to federal candidates went to Democrats, and less than 1% went to Republicans. Now let me be clear, these employees have every right to donate to the candidate of their choice. But when any workplace is this biased towards one ideology it would be a miracle if its work was not biased against an opposing ideology. No wonder the employees at these very, very, Democratic companies keep suppressing conservative ideas while moderating content. And the suppression of conservative ideas is continuing right through to Election Day. Just this week, Twitter suspended U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan for 20 hours for updating the American people on the construction of the southern border wall. The moderators at Twitter said the tweet violated their rules regulating \u201chateful conduct.\u201d This is completely unacceptable. Fortunately, Morgan announced in a tweet Thursday night that Twitter had unlocked his account. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Each of these Big Tech CEOs has made public statements claiming to operate his company without political bias. Clearly, that is false.\u00a0These claims make me think there is a good case to be made that these companies are engaging in \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practices\u201d in violation of federal law. If these companies are not already in violation of federal consumer law protections,\u00a0then it may be necessary to review these laws to ensure that these companies are held accountable, ensuring that they must provide truthful information to consumers and are not able to act deceptively or unfairly in the marketplace.

            "article_content": "Attorney General Bill Barr discusses the Durham investigation on 'Hannity.' This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" August 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, the attorney general of the United States, Bill Barr, will join us. We have an exquisite interview with breaking news. That is straight ahead. Also, the national security advisor to the U.S., Robert O'Brien, will be here. More details on what the president's historic Middle East peace deal is. And interestingly, Biden taking credit when just the opposite is true. We'll also talk about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and they're now ready to be anointed from their basement bunkers. They can't hide, they're going to campaign. No, they're not. Apparently, they're going to meet with the voters. They certainly aren't going to answer any questions from their adoring cult fans of propaganda wing. That would be the mob and the media. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (INAUDIBLE) REPORTER: -- what do you think about that? JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Pure Trump. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, guys, let's go. Let's go, come on. BIDEN: He didn't want an election. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, let's go, you guys, come on. Let's go. Come on, let's go. You guys, let's go. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right. Senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny is joining me now. A couple notes, Jeff. One, not a whole lot of questions from reporters there. I mean, we keep pressing the Biden campaign. There needs to be more questions from reporters, we know that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Yeah, may be two pressers with, oh, in the teleprompter, I'm supposed to go to Joe now. Yeah, in 140 days, two, really? Are they going to debate or are they going to try to duck that, too? Why bother? The mob and the media -- they're already fawning over Kamala Harris, and, of course, they love Joe. They don't call him out on anything. New York toilet paper \"Times\" called her a pragmatic moderate. That is another lie by the New York toilet paper \"Times\". Georgy Stephanopoulos, Clinton hack-turned-make-believe journalist over at fake news ABC, he's spreading the same B.S. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST: Kamala Harris comes from the middle of the road moderate wing of the Democratic Party, not the first choice of progressives, but Joe Biden thinking that this historic move as the first woman of color on a national ticket will overcome that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That's not true, either. The mob and the media 99 percent state run Democratic socialist fake news. But yeah, totally moderate. That would be, except for her real voting record. In 2019, for example, she's to the left of Bolshevik Bernie Sanders, along with her vow of -- oh, yeah, confiscate guns, and via executive fiat and order, and her support of, oh, yeah, Medicare-for-All with zero chance of you having your own health care provider. No choice. I thought liberals were pro-choice. And her sponsorship of the New Green Deal. She's a co-sponsor in U.S. Senate, you know, the plan to ban fracking. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, are you watching this? Limit, by the way, ban straws, limit red meat -- that's all moderate, sure. I see Georgy hasn't changed since his days trying to bully reporters into not publishing stories about Bill Clinton's affairs. George Stephanopoulos, nothing but a far left political hack masquerading as a journalist. ABC News, well, they are not telling you the truth and they are not alone. Naturally, some of Kamala Harris' biggest cheerleaders, they work for fake news CNN and they're fake. Here's what their vetting process looks like over there. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think she gave a very powerful speech and if there's any doubt that Kamala Harris is not going to be able to go on the attack as vice presidential candidate usually do, that was erased today. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought Kamala Harris gave a fantastic speech. She absolutely nailed it. Her ability I think to show this tremendous range, the personal side of her. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, I mean, it was a beautiful speech. Both of them, they strengthen each other. If you've got to give a headline today it would be \"hope reborn.\" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's as though she was saying them from the mountaintop as opposed to just a high school gymnasium there and I think that the ease in which they work together was very apparent. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Well, because that's the exact opposite when she got less than 2 percent of the primary and she did memorize her attack lines well and she delivered them and called Joe Biden pretty much a racist. So you've got Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, they're running for the highest office in the land. Yeah, there would be critical questions that the mob needs to ask Joe and Kamala, they've got to answer it. Just today, Biden announced a plan to impose a federal mask mandate. Apparently, he wants every American to wear a mask any time you step outside of your home. Now, I've been very outspoken, I'm all for Americans voluntarily wearing masks when it's crowded and you can't socially distance. As a matter of fact, I said anecdotally, it worked at the super supermarket I went through at the epicenter of all of this, in the midst of the worst moments in New York. Not one person got corona, or the Rite-Aid I would go to a CVS, because they had mass and plastic. Anecdotally, they work. And guess what? What, we're going to have mask police next? What, well, next they say after Operation Warp Speed of President Trump and we're now in final stage trials for a vaccine, are we going to mandate that? I would say that's up to people to decide. They get to choose. Will the Biden administration be handing out fines or arresting people don't comply with their mandates that are apparently universal? Are they universal? What about jogging outdoors? What about swimming in the ocean or on a beach? What about those who work outdoors? What about professional sports athletes? What, does the first baseman have to socially -- is that socially distant enough from the second baseman or the shortstop or third baseman? What about people eating at a restaurant reading outdoors any of these questions ever going to be answered? Well, even asked? Now, this is just one issue that must be addressed? In fact, during the primaries, it was Senator Harris raising numerous serious concerns. I think she memorized her lines and delivered them quite well when she confronted - - well, the ever forgetful Joe, the corrupt Joe, about his work with segregationists and proposing integration and so much more. We'll remind you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: On the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive health care, and including women who were the victims of rape and incest, do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that? Because you've only since you've been running for president this time. I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it. REPORTER: Do you believe that the vice president should enter this race? HARRIS: Oh, he's going to have to make that decision for himself. I wouldn't tell him what to do. The issue of lynching is part of the stain on America's history. REPORTER: He apologized this morning on Twitter, saying, I should not have used those words. Do you accept that apology? HARRIS: I think that's right for him to apologize, yes. You also worked with them to oppose busing and, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Wow, Kamala has evolved election year conversion I guess you might say. Also, Kamala Harris also believed Joe Biden's accusers. Apparently during the primary, she sympathized with all the women that Joe made really uncomfortable with this creepy groping and touching and hugging. Remember all this, Kamala? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) BIDEN: I got hairy legs that turn that -- that turn blonde in the sun. (MUSIC) BIDEN: And the kids used to come up and reach into the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again. (MUSIC) BIDEN: Let's dance. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And we're not even showing you the really creepy moments with younger people. Kamala, did you forget about that? Do you no longer care about this conduct? Did you evolve as you say, I think you just used the words, oh yeah, evolving? What about Biden's work with segregationists to slow school integration? Remember, he worked with the former Klansman, the guy that actually filibustered the historic Civil Rights Act and didn't support the Voting Rights Act. And guess what, your BFF partnered with the former Klansman because Joe Biden didn't want his children to grow up in a racial jungle if his kids went to integrated schools. You just no longer care that Biden was close to the former Klansman, praised the former Klansman, worked with the former Klansman on something like integration? You talked about that in that debate moment you had with Joe. What about principle? What about his comment you can't go to a 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent? And I'm not joking he said? What about his recent comments suggesting that African-Americans are all the same or you ain't black or poor kids or just as smart as white kids? OK, really, Kamala? Is the mob and the media, you're going to ask these questions? Are you that desperate in this case to be vice president of the United States that we'll just forget all about all this? Of course, this isn't just about Senator Harris. It's about everyone in the mob in the media. They refuse to vet Joe Biden. We do we will do their job as we always do. And today, the president he answered dozens of questions like he almost does on a daily basis from a hostile press corps, a cult that is psychotic in their hatred of him. So, ask yourself, why doesn't Joe Biden, why doesn't Kamala Harris answer questions? Where's their lengthy press conference? Now, my guess is they're going to show up for a fluffy interview on fake news CNN. They're going to show up on conspiracy TV MSDNC. That's where they'll show up. Probably nowhere else. Are they going to show up for the debates? Are they not capable of the tough questions? Go on with Chris Wallace, go on with -- well, anybody that will ask you a tough question. Anyway, what are they hiding? Is it that they're radical, out of touch socialist positions, maybe? Is it Joe Biden's racist rhetoric? Is it that Kamala Harris's terrible record as a prosecutor? Is it Joe Biden what was an obvious -- well, lack of strength and stamina and mental acuity, you know, mental alertness? Because I think the answer might be all the above. And in 82 days, the American people got to make an important choice. And before the first debate, 16 states begin early voting. In just a few moments, we're going to be joined by the Attorney General Bill Barr with an exclusive interview and breaking news. First, joining us, Fox News contributor, former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, along with Fox News contributor, Tammy Bruce. Tammy, let's start with the creep -- oh, by the way, great job, Governor, last night. Let's start with the creepy stuff and there's -- you know what, it's aired a lot before and I just decided it's not fair to air the stuff with the kids because that's really creepy and the sniffing of the hair and in your face -- I'm like get away. Give me some breathing room, you're creeping me out with all the touchy-feely crap that he does. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you know and this is why the media has realized that -- yes, this is why the media has had to realize I think you can hear me, right? HANNITY: Yes, that Joe Biden has always been a problem and why -- and why he's got to be protected. And so, they've got this -- they've got him in a literal basement, and with Kamala Harris, they are trying to establish a virtual bunker, right? They also as we saw with the press conference earlier, as you played, ways to just kind of -- move them both out quickly. They know that also Senator Harris is not what she appears to be any more than Joe Biden is. These are the two of the most contrived, fake individuals that it's a classic example of what the swamp used to be, individuals who are moving through a theater, if you will, a presentation of -- you know, fraudster kind of actors who are presenting to people what they want to hear. Senator Harris, in particular, is a transactional kind of individual. She will use people for what she -- what she wants. She will become what they want her to be. And then her staying in that position is conditional. So, you never know what's going to happen. The American people need leadership. What is great about President Trump and what very often irritates people because it is so unique is that what you see is what you get. He has been the same guy from day one. You don't have to wonder who it is he is. This is what has shocked the media. He is what he is and there's a transparency to that that makes who Joe Biden and Senator Harris even more obviously frauds at this point. I -- I think I have to go back and add up all the questions he's taken in a week and all the questions asked through the entire campaign of the ever forgetful, seemingly frail, weak and tired, needing a hot cocoa and a nappy every afternoon Biden. And I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Governor Huckabee, because the left and the mob and the media and Democrats, they were -- they were not exactly nice to John McCain about his age or Ronald Reagan about his. But how about some fairness, they're not even demanding interviews from this guy. MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, they're not really questioning the fact that Kamala Harris was all over Joe Biden about everything from racism to sexism being a sexual predator. What you played a few minutes ago pointed all of that out, which means that if you're going to campaign in a primary, be careful what you say about your opponents because you may have to stand on the stage and change your mind. I mean, Kamala Harris at first was saying Joe Biden wasn't worth basically a milk bucket under a bull. He was just that worthless. Now, suddenly, you know, he's going to be the next face that you'll see chiseled on Mount Rushmore. Well, which time was she lying? The Mount Rushmore or the milk bucket under the bull? It can't be both and that's what she needs to be asked by some of these media people that might as well go down into the basement with Joe because they sure aren't challenging him with tough questions. I -- will they get away I'll ask you both an exit question, Tammy, you first. Will they get away trying not to debate? Is that the next stop in this bunker basement non-campaign because every time -- Joe's run a little baby campaign, occasionally, steps out of the basement bunker and every time, he does -- are you a junkie? Do you get tested for coke? Come on, man. Come on. I can look forward to debating Donald Trump -- I can't wait and I'm willing to compare my cognitive and physical -- well, what's the word, what's the - - oh fitness. You know we're endowed by the -- oh, you know, the thing. You know, God the creator of everything, Joe. Are they going to let this continue the mob? And will he debate? BRUCE: Well, look, both Biden and Harris were not prepared for when they were attacked during a debate. They can deliver one-liners and Joe Biden not very well, but, of course, Harris was shocked I think when Tulsi Gabbard went after her. She did not know how to respond. So any surprises move them both off of their feet, of course, they'd rather not debate but that was Hillary's mistake. Hillary debated but their attitude was, underestimate Donald Trump, stay out of the limelight you're going to coast through this, we're entitled to it, it's going to be handed to us, the American people didn't like that, they don't like this inauthentic, dynamic with Kamala Harris already. They know what's going on with Biden and if they try to hide, the American people will find that to be cowardly and it will indicate that they have something to hide. HANNITY: Last word, Governor. HUCKABEE: I just want to say that you need to apologize to America, Sean. Your book \"Live Free or Die\" has resulted in the deforestation of thousands and thousands of acres of trees that have been made for this best-selling book, that's what I think you need to come clean on, it is how many trees have been lost. HANNITY: Imagine, the New York toilet paper Times, you have to win by so much to be number one, they had to kill them. I got to roll. We're late we have the attorney general standing by. BRUCE: That's right. HANNITY: Governor, great job last night. Tammy, always good to see you. We turn to this breaking news tonight, major federal law enforcement initiative. It is named Operation Legend. Now, the program leverages key resources from the U.S. government to track down and arrest perpetrators responsible for unsolved murders. Now, it was named after a 4-year-old little boy, LeGend Taliferro, who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his bed. And breaking tonight, his suspected killer has now been taken, thankfully, into custody and charged with second-degree murder. Here with more, an exclusive one-on-one interview, the attorney general of the United States, his first time on \"Hannity.\" Sir, thank you for being with us. This is huge. WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hi. Hi, Sean. HANNITY: And thank God it looks like we got our man? BARR: Well, he -- that's what we believe. And he's been charged with the murder. As you know, with the demonization of the police that has occurred recently, we have seen an upsurge in violence in the -- many of our inner cities. And our response to that has been to work closely with state and local law enforcement who are willing to work closely with us in a number of cities, including Kansas City, to go after these violent criminals and stop this bloodshed. And we called it Operation Legend in honor of this 4-year-old boy who was shot. So, he became a symbol of the black lives that were being lost in the inner city, the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds that have been killed, with the demonization of the police. And, today, I think the message is that in this particular case, the system -- our system worked. What happened is a symbol of the fact that the local law enforcement, in this case, the Kansas City police, working closely with the FBI and U.S. Marshals, were able to charge -- find this man and charge him with murder. And that becomes a symbol of what we can do. And we can do it. What's involved here is the will to deal with this violent crime in the inner cities. It can be handled. We need the will. HANNITY: I paid very close attention to your interview, and I thought -- and so did many people, it was highly viewed -- with the great one, I him, Mark Levin, on \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" And you went into detail about -- quote -- \"a new form of urban guerrilla warfare\" and how demonstrations -- and, again, some are very peaceful protesters. There was universal outrage and shock and horror of the video of George Floyd. That can't happen, Mr. Attorney General, in this country. And I know you agree with that. But hijacking the demonstrations away from some peaceful protesters and provoking violence, we have seen over 2,000 cops injured, 14 now dead, rocks and bottles and bricks, and Molotov cocktails, knives, hockey sticks, canes, frozen water bottles. I mean, it's now warfare against cops in this country in some of these cities, sir. BARR: Well, that's absolutely right. The legitimate demonstrations, the First Amendment activity, the protests in the wake of Mr. Floyd's death have long since given way to violent attacks, efforts to tear down the system, violent attacks on the police, on federal courts, on police precincts by a small group of radical, violent extremists, whose agenda has nothing to do with the death of George Floyd or protecting black lives, and everything to do with a very radical agenda and creating chaos and trying to tear down the system. HANNITY: All right, Mr. Attorney General, stay there. We have a lot to ask you, an update on the Durham report. We want to ask you about this mail-in voting push and other important issues as it relates to the law. We will get to that, more with the attorney general right after the break. Also, the president today announces what is a historic peace agreement between Israel, United Arab Emirates. Joe Biden from his basement bunker actually tried to take credit for it when just the opposite is true. I will explain that in a special \"Hannity\" mini monologue, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right, as we continue our exclusive interview with the attorney general of the United States, Attorney General Barr. Mr. Attorney General, the president commented. You were very clear. By the way, you -- let me first say, you had the patience of job on steroids and human growth hormone when you went before that clown show in Congress. God bless you for it, because I don't think I have the patience you do. And it was really pretty despicable to me. The president weighed in on Durham. You were very clear in your testimony. The president doesn't tell you what to do. You're independent. The president said today that he hopes that the Durham report and that you, as attorney general, won't be politically correct. I hope that too. Mr. Attorney General, I have spent three years unpeeling the layers of an onion, in terms of premeditated fraud on a FISA court. You have deleted subpoenaed e-mails. You have knowledge we know that they were warned in August of 2016 not to trust that dossier, which was the bulk of information for the FISA warrants. The sub source in January 2017 confirms, none of that was true, and it was bar talk. I guess, just as the wheels of justice turn slowly, I feel impatience over it. Can you give us any update? BARR: Yes, Sean. Well, first, as to the political correctness, if I was worried about being politically correct, I wouldn't have joined this administration. As I made clear... HANNITY: That's actually a good line, too. OK. BARR: Yes. Well, as I made clear, I'm going to call them as I see them. And that's why I came in. I thought I'm in a -- I think I'm in a position to do that. There are two different things going on, Sean. One, I have said that the American people need to know what actually happened. We need to get the story of what happened in 2016 and '17 now out. That will be done. The second aspect of this is, if people cross the line, if people involved in that activity violated the criminal law, they will be charged. And John Durham is an independent man, highly experienced. And his investigation is pursuing apace. There was some delay because of COVID. But I'm satisfied with the progress. And I have said there are going to be developments, significant developments, before the election. But we're not doing this on the election schedule. We're aware of the election. We're not going to do anything inappropriate before the election. But we're not being dictated to by this schedule. What's dictating the timing of this are developments in the case. And there will be developments. Tomorrow, there will be a development in the case. You know, it's not an earth-shattering development, but it is an indication that things are moving along at the proper pace, as dictated by the facts in this investigation. HANNITY: Mr. Attorney General, you once said this isn't about a report. This is a criminal investigation. You were very clear that they spied. The president of the United States was spied on deep into his presidency, you said. Now, based on what we know -- and Andrew McCabe said it, and Sally Yates said it, and Rod Rosenstein and Sally Yates would not sign those warrants today. We know that they -- the FBI knew, beyond any doubt, that not only was that dossier -- without the dossier, Yates and McCabe both say, there is no FISA warrant, that they knew it was false. They were told it was false. The law even requires them, as soon as they know that it was false, to go back to the FISA court. Based on what we know on the record, I just see premeditated fraud against the court. And I wouldn't even lie before Judge Judy, Mr. Attorney General, because I think they would throw away the key in my case. BARR: Well, when we feel we can prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it will be charged. I can tell you that. HANNITY: Yes. Let me ask you about mail-in voting. I paid very close attention, again, to your interview with Mark. And the -- those that want to experiment with different ways of voting, they want to do this now with 82 days to do go before the election. I don't have confidence in government to fulfill many promises at all. Doesn't it lend itself to great opportunity for fraud? BARR: Yes, I think it is grossly irresponsible to be doing what the Democratic Party is doing now. We have had very close races in recent history. The country is divided. If anything, we should be assuring the integrity of our elections, so that government going forward will be legitimate and will be accepted as legitimate. The idea of conducting our elections by wholesale mail-in ballots is reckless and wrong. Everyone knows what has happened in these cases. We are not talking about voters going, requesting a ballot specifically, saying who they are, proving who they are, and then submitting a ballot by mail. We are talking mail-outs to everyone on the voting list. And every experience with that has had thousands and thousands of ballots floating around, not just the state, but the country. I have friends who haven't lived in California in 21 years who received ballots. There are ballots left in boxes in apartment buildings. Ballots are for -- for people who used to live at addresses are delivered to those addresses. They can be filled out by anybody. This is reckless. And it could create serious questions about the integrity of the election. And to do this, when there are -- a closely divided country, as we are, is playing with fire, in my view. HANNITY: Mr. Attorney General, you talked about the Seattle police chief, Carmen Best. I felt, wow, what an amazing -- what an amazing example of service and dedication to her community and how they -- she literally had to resign because of this defund effort, and that she was not given the ability to use the training that all police officers have, that we know how to disperse crowds. And it's usually tear gas, it is usually pepper spray involved, but they have taken these tools away from officers. I believe it's now created a very dangerous situation for all of them. I don't think it takes a lot of -- an MIT or Harvard degree to figure out, this is not going to end well for a lot of these cities. What do you say to those that are demonizing the police? These groups -- you have talked about the group Black Lives Matter. You have talked about the group Antifa, or Antifa, and those that believe -- and Joe Biden -- I won't bring you into politics -- but said, they have become the enemy. Kamala Harris says she's happy with the LAPD defunding the police. I don't think this is going to end well, sir. I think lives will be lost as a result. BARR: Well, lives are being lost in violent crime and the demonization of the police. Carmen Best is an example of the highly competent and professional and dedicated police professionals we have in this country. We are blessed with that throughout the country. They are excellent. And she is a great example of it. And we should be supporting them. And being a police officer is one of the -- it is the hardest job in the United States. We are asking people to go into very dangerous situations. They have jobs that are terribly wearing on them as individuals and on their families, to go into potentially deadly situations, not knowing what will happen. And we have to continue to attract the best people into these jobs. And unless we support the police, we are not going to have a police force. These communities are not going to have the safety. Now, a lot of the liberals will buy themselves out of that. They will go to resort towns and so forth, and they will escape the consequences of it. But the people in the inner cities won't. Their lives will be destroyed. Their opportunity will be -- will be -- you know, they won't have the opportunity they otherwise would have. Their schools will be overrun by gangs. That's not caring about black lives. And people talk about implicit racism or systemic racism. The racism in this country, look no further than our public education system. That's a racist system, maintained by the Democratic Party and the teachers union, keeping inner-city kids in failing schools, instead of putting the resources in the hands of the parents to choose the schools to send their kids to. That's empowering kids. That's giving them a future. HANNITY: Every child, they are our nation's national treasure. Last question. You did talk about the political environment, and an environment where people have been trying to impeach Donald Trump from day one. We have now seen the criminalization of political differences. For example, the I.G. made referrals about lying about top officials in the FBI, and nothing happens. There was no pre-dawn raids with 29 guys in tactical gear and frogmen over those process crimes, nor were there CNN cameras, because those guys haven't been arrested. I worry that America is descending into a two-tiered justice system. Am I wrong? BARR: No, I think it's the right worry, and that's the reason I came back into government. We can't let it happen. But here's the thing, Sean. The way out of this, the way out of the politicization and the corruption of the justice system, where it's used as a political weapon by one party against another, is not to deliver tit-for- tat. It's not to use the tactics of the other side. It's to uphold the rule of law, use the right standard. And that's what I'm trying to do, one standard for everybody. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I know you can't share a lot. I -- I spent three-and-a-half years. I think we have found a lot of truth, the 1 percent. I always make the distinction, not the 99 percent of good, premier law enforcement intelligence agencies in the world. And I hope those that abuse power, the more corrupt, are exposed. Thank you for your time, sir. BARR: Thank you, Sean. HANNITY: All right. Up next, it's unbelievable -- Joe Biden's actually trying to take credit for what was a historic peace agreement that was announced, national security adviser Robert O'Brien. And later, White House Press Secretary Kelly McEnany. She is here. A lot more to come. Please stay with us tonight on \"Hannity\". (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: And breaking news today, the president announced what is a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, an achievement the national security adviser, Ambassador Robert O'Brien says should make President Trump the front-runner for a Nobel peace prize. Well, that'll make the mob's head spin around in circles and then you can expect probably green puke projectile flying out. Anyway, shortly after the announcement, Joe Biden actually tried to take credit for this agreement, calling it the work of multiple administrations. No, Joe, that's a lie. The reason that you now see this alliance with the Emirates, the Saudis, the Egyptians, the U.S., and Israel and Jordanians is frankly because of your stupidity and Barack stupidity and your appeasement policies for eight years. You got nothing while sucking up to Iran not even inspections. But you gave them billion dollars in cash another currency, got nothing. Well, guess what that did? That then alarmed the entire region, so a new alliance Donald Trump has put together with unprecedented cooperation, leading to today's announcement, because all of these countries, they don't want Iranian hegemony in the region and a nuclear-armed Iran. Here with more, national security adviser, Ambassador O'Brien. Thank you, sir, for being with us. ROBERT O'BRIEN, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Good to be with you, Sean. HANNITY: Five years ago, if you would have told me that this deal would take place, that the Israelis, the U.S., the Jordanians, Egyptians, the -- the Saudis and the Emirates, would be united in sharing intelligence and a lot more that I know that's going on from my other sources in the world -- I wouldn't have believed you. I think actually, the weakness of Biden and Obama caused this action. Am I wrong? O'BRIEN: Well, listen I think Vice President Biden's claim is the sincerest form of flattery. This is a major, huge accomplishment by the president, and also by the crown prince, Mohammed Bin Zayed, and Prime Minister Benjamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu in Israel. What courage it took for those men to come together and what skill it took for the president to bring them together, to bring peace to the Middle East, the first time in 25 years that Israel and an Arab country have signed a peace accord. And we're calling it the Abraham Accord, the Arabs are calling the Ibrahim Accord, and our Jewish friends are calling it the Avraham Accord. What a great accomplishment for the president United States. And I -- look, I wasn't speaking in jest when I said he should be the front-runner for the Nobel Prize. I've been here for about a year as you know, Sean, and since I've been here, the president negotiated a ceasefire between the Kurds and the Turks that everyone said couldn't be done. He brought forth the Middle East -- the vision for Middle East Peace to get a Israeli-Palestinian peace pro -- peace plan back in play. And he's brought peace to Afghanistan, at least between the U.S. and the Taliban. We haven't lost a soldier in Afghanistan since February 29th in combat, and we're going to be down to 5,000 troops in Afghanistan. And now, he's brought peace to Israel and the UAE. I mean, it's a pretty remarkable record of achievement. HANNITY: Well -- O'BRIEN: I don't -- I don't know who else would be in the running for a Nobel Prize if it's not President Trump. HANNITY: Well, knockout -- he also knocked out the caliphate. Joe and Barack couldn't do that. He took out Soleimani and Baghdadi and associates and the al Qaeda leader in Yemen and many other these leading terrorists, is -- you know, we went from the worst relationship with Joe and Barack with Israel to the best relationship. Israel's never had a better friend. We've never had a president speak to the National Right to Life march, this president did, and no greater president that championed religious freedoms. This is truly historic and I think we're going to see, you know, what from this? Do you think this is the beginning of more agreements? O'BRIEN: I think it is. I think we're just getting rolling here and the president's already been in touch with other leaders in the region. His diplomats and our team have been out talking to folks. Secretary Pompeo has been working on this. I think we're going to see peace breaking out in a number of countries. And even in some different regions, I think we're going to see something interesting happen in Serbia and Kosovo soon. So the president's known as a great deal maker. History's going to remember him as a great peacemaker. HANNITY: All right, sir, Robert O'Brien, thank you, sir, for being with us. Great job by the secretary of state, great job by the attorney general. A lot of things getting done. You don't hear about it in the mob. When we come back, speaking of the mob, I don't know how she does her job. I couldn't do her job. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. She's next, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Joining us now, White House press secretary, I have no idea how she does this job, I would not be able to do this job. This is the hardest job on earth, and you're dealing with the biggest beep, beep, beep in the world. But she does it every day with a smile on her face. And I love your briefing book. I love it. I also love when you just say \"I'm done, see you later, good-bye.\" Love when the president does that, too. I want to bring you and ask you this. So, Joe Biden and, what, 100 or however many days has done two press conferences with, oh, time to go to Tom next. And I watch the questions you ask, I watch the question the president answers, how is it possible they're pulling this off? KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Yeah, it's incredible, Sean. Look, first of all, let me say with regards to the briefing book, I get a lot of my content from this program which I watch every night. You are always on top -- HANNITY: Oh, boy, you're going to get slammed tomorrow for that. Don't -- that was -- mistake, mistake. Don't acknowledge you know me. MCENANY: Totally fine. Totally fine, I know you and I interned for you actually. It was my first job. HANNITY: You did, I'm very proud of you. MCENANY: Yes, I did. I -- thank you so much. But, look, you know, this president doesn't hide in a basement. This president doesn't scare away from questioning. This president takes to the podium every day, looks the American people directly in the eye and answers their question and speaks to them. Every time when he walks out to Marine One, when he goes on to Air Force One oftentimes, versus Obama, who did a press conference, what, every 30 days, never spoke to the press. This president doesn't hide in a basement. He addresses the American people, and that's something that we should be proud of. HANNITY: You know, the problem is, is that, what you're dealing with every day, they all want their moment, that they are arguing with you or they're arguing with the president. Explain to people how that works. MCENANY: Yeah, it's right, people are out to elevate their stardom as a reporter, to have their moment, they get that viral moment. They have their name trend on Twitter. But, look, that's not what this is about. Sean, what these briefings are about for me and for this president are highlighting names like LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old who was shot in his bed who I know that you covered, who today, thanks to A.G. Barr, President Trump and the work we've done, we've not only highlighted violence in the streets, but charged, who we think is a killer of that young boy. That's what this is about for us. It's not about trending names on Twitter. But unfortunately, for a lot of reporters, it is. HANNITY: And it's -- look, I know we talk about bias a lot, and I use my words, they're the mob and the media, and it's like cult and their psychotic hatreds of all things Donald Trump. If the dog bites, bee stings, if you're feeling said, if he cured cancer, they want to impeach him in my view. But the reality is, they really don't want information. Do you find a desire to get an honest answer from a lot of them? I mean, I'm -- I don't want to sweep, you know, no broad, sweeping generalizations, I see too many people. All of this is gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. MCENANY: I think it's a great question. And, look, I think it's easily identifiable by the American people. There are some reporters who come in and they truly want that information. They'll come to my office and they'll say, look, this is what I want to know from the president and I will go to him, I'll get the information, I'll convey it to them in a briefing. There are others who aren't interested in that, who it's about the viral moment, and I think the American people who watch can very much discern those interested in getting information to the people and those interested in serving themselves. HANNITY: You see, I've got to believe, if I was trying to do your job which I could never do and there's no amount of money you could pay me to do your job, is that it's got to be frustrating knowing that this to them is a game, because we're talking about serious issues of great consequence. MCENANY: It's -- right. You know, journalists serve a very important purpose. They are the intermediary between what goes on just to my left, in the West Wing, and the American people who want to know what's going on in that building, and they are the in-between. And when they ignore wholesale scandals like the spying on President Trump, done by Obama and Joe Biden and Susan Rice, when that is ignored, it is a complete disservice to the American people, for whom they should be seeking the answers to those immense political scandals like what happened to President Trump. HANNITY: The fact that they won't even acknowledge that the whole Russia hoax was a lie and they spread the lie and apologize and retract, and the fact that they missed the biggest abuse of corruption -- MCENANY: And got Pulitzers. HANNITY: -- abuse of power, corruption scandal. Kayleigh McEnany, keep up the good work, not an easy job. Thank you. More \"Hannity\" next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Again, I want to think you as I did last night. New book has out. Two weeks in a row, number one in the country. Even the New York toilet paper \"Times\", they couldn't fake it, this time. We won by such a large margin. Listen, if you don't have a copy, this is the definitive copy. This is it. This is what's at stake? Eighty-two days, and I shudder at the policy stated or implemented, it's bad. Amazon.com, 40 percent off, at Costco, Walmart, Target, Hannity.com. Thank you. All right.

            "article_content": "Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader, rolls out House Republicans' 'Commitment to America' plan Every four years, Americans have the opportunity to choose the leader of the free world and other elected officials, including members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. This year, estimates are that a record number will vote \u2014 some casting ballots early and others on Election Day. The contrast between the two men running for president is crystal clear. I am voting for President Trump because his record is the difference between four years of results and four decades of rhetoric. TRUMP JR. WARNS ELECTION IS 'ABOUT FREEDOM VERSUS TYRANNY, CAPITALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM' President Trump took office at a time when wages for the middle class had been stagnant for years, when good-paying jobs and cutting-edge technology had been offshored or stolen by China, and when terrorists in the Middle East controlled territory the size of Great Britain. The so-called experts predicted this decline would be the \u201cnew normal.\u201d But Republicans and President Trump understand that managed decline is unacceptable. Together, our\u00a0policies reversed it. And despite unprecedented, unending and unfounded attacks on his presidency, he delivered historic results in the economy, national security, energy and the courts. For three years until the coronavirus pandemic hit, job openings increased, small business closures fell, and wages rose \u2014 including for the lowest earners \u2014 because Republicans cut taxes, slashed regulations, and renegotiated bad trade deals. America also achieved energy independence by increasing energy production, and we did it cleanly and safely. In 2019, we generated the largest decline of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the world, while also becoming the largest oil and gas producer. We built the greatest economy in a generation and we will do it again. Despite economic troubles singularly caused by the pandemic, the president and Republicans got right to work to get the economy back on solid footing. Through the most aggressive relief package in history, we saved 51 million jobs \u2014 and half of the jobs lost have been regained. We are well on our way to getting the American economy back to where it was just nine months ago. KEVIN MCCARTHY FUNDRAISING TOPS $103M IN RACE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE As for the coronavirus itself, a safe and effective vaccine will be available to Americans in record time because President Trump unleashed the brightest minds in the public and private sectors. The ISIS physical caliphate has been destroyed. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian terrorist Gen. Qassem Soleimani are dead. And the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan are normalizing relations with Israel. Other presidents promised to move the American Embassy in Israel to its rightful home in Jerusalem, but only President Trump had the fortitude to do it. The president\u2019s courageous actions have built confidence in America at home and on the world stage. President Trump\u2019s reelection is the difference between the most pro-life administration in history and taxpayer-funded abortion on demand. It is the difference between a solid, originalist majority on the Supreme Court that interprets the law as written and a liberal, \u201cliving Constitution\u201d majority that would chip away at our rights as citizens. After four years, the results are clear: America is safer, stronger and more prosperous. Some 56 percent of Americans told Gallup in September that they are better off today than they were four years ago. The coronavirus, the lockdowns, and riots can\u2019t overturn the reality that conservative policies have paved the path to a Great American Comeback. By contrast, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has been in office for 47 years. He was vice president, a powerful Senate committee chairman, and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination twice before. He accomplished nothing. When asked about the Gallup poll, Biden said Americans who believe they are better off today should not vote for him because \u201ctheir memory is not very good.\u201d If there is a defining aspect of Biden\u2019s career, it\u2019s that he\u2019s been wrong on almost every issue of public importance. Yet radical Democrats embrace Biden today because they know they can manipulate him to pass an extreme agenda that would dismantle our institutions, \u201creimagine\u201d capitalism, and divide our nation. On the bread-and-butter issue of jobs and the economy, Biden\u2019s tax hikes would raise taxes on the middle class. Additionally, his plan to \u201ctransition\u201d from fracking and phase out the oil and natural gas industries would eliminate thousands of jobs, raise costs for families, and leave us more dependent on China and other foreign countries for energy. On constitutional questions, Biden once opposed court packing, but now wants to set up a left-wing commission to change our institutions. He supports the most extreme pro-abortion agenda in history: taxpayer-funded abortions, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and making abortion on demand the law of the land. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And beyond these disastrous policies, Biden has rushed to embrace a toxic left-wing ideology that rejects our founding principles and reduces individuals to their racial identity. \u201cAmerica was an idea,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve never lived up to it.\u201d In other words, Biden thinks America is fundamentally and fatally flawed. But of course, the opposite is true. America is the freest nation in human history. Our people are creative, kind, and the most generous in the world. No nation is perfect, but America is the only one \u201cconceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If you believe in those sacred principles, the choice in this election could not be clearer. Forward in freedom or backward in socialism. Forward in prosperity or backward in poverty. Forward in personal liberty or backward in government control. As Republicans, it is our mission to restore our American way of life, rebuild the greatest economy in a generation, and renew the American Dream. That is why House Republicans have released our Commitment to America, and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for President Trump and why he deserves four more years in office.

            "article_content": "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., suggests how censorship of free speech can be prevented from swaying the presidential election. This is a rush transcript from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\" September 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. On February 6th of this year, a group of researchers from the South China University of Technology uploaded a paper on the origins of the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0\nTheir paper found that contrary to popular accounts, the virus likely did not originate from an exotic animal in a so-called wet market. Instead, the researchers concluded quote, \"The killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nNow to restate the researchers who concluded this were Chinese scientists who work for a Chinese University. And for that reason, understandably, they were concerned about the health implications for their own country of what they found.\u00a0\u00a0\nTheir paper ended this way, quote: \"Safety levels may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories. Regulations may need to be taken to relocate these laboratories away from city centers and other densely populated places.\" End quote.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs it happens, February 6th, which is the day that paper went online, was also the date of the first coronavirus death in this country. So the American media had every reason to pay attention to what the Chinese scientists had found, but they didn't.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor nearly two months, the Chinese paper was all but ignored by news outlets in this country. On March 31st, this show broadcast its contents.\u00a0\nBy then, more than 3,700 Americans have died from the coronavirus. Tens of thousands were then hospitalized. So we imagined there would be a serious national effort to find out where this virus came from, to find out how the pandemic started.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut we were wrong about that. There wasn't. There was silence.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe people in charge of our public health infrastructure simply ignored credible evidence that contradicted the Chinese government's version of events.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat was five and a half months ago. During those five and a half months, our society has been completely upended by the coronavirus. Nearly 200,000 Americans have died from it.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow more than ever, we believe it is worth knowing where this disease came from. That ought to be the first question.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo in search of an answer, last night, on this show, we spoke to a Chinese virologist called Dr. Li-Meng Yan. Yan was one of the first scientists on Earth to study the Wuhan outbreak back in December of last year. That was before the rest of the world knew it existed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat she found during her research put her on a collision course with the Chinese government. In April, she fled her country in fear for her life.\u00a0\nNow, she lives the United States in hiding.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere is some of what she told us last night on the show.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nDR. LI-MENG YAN, CHINESE VIROLOGIST WHISTLEBLOWER:\u00a0 From my first report, I can present a solid scientific evidence to our audience that this virus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV2 virus -- actually is not from nature.\u00a0\u00a0\nI worked with the top corona virologists in the world. So together with my experience, I can tell you, this is created in the lab. This is from that template owned by China military, and also, it has spread to the world to make such damage.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 To make such damage. Do you believe the Chinese government released this intentionally on purpose? Did they do this?\u00a0\u00a0\nYAN:\u00a0 Yes, of course, it is intentionally.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 COVID-19 is not from nature, she said. It was created in a lab in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government intentionally unleashed it on the world. Those are her claims. Are they true? We have no way of verifying them. We do know that Dr. Li-Meng Yan is not a quack.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe has authored peer-reviewed papers on coronavirus transmission in both \"Nature\" magazine and \"The Lancet.\" Those are two of the most respected publications in all of science.\u00a0\u00a0\nHer paper on the origin of COVID-19, which she has published online is not frivolous. In it, she points to specific evidence for the claims that she makes. She identifies so-called cut sites, which are frequently used in genomic engineering that would allow scientists to swap in sequences from other viruses to create what she described last night as a Frankenstein bioweapon.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe writes that she has firsthand knowledge that the Chinese military has a template virus with cut sites designed for that very purpose.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce again, we can't verify this, but it's clear that Dr. Li-Meng Yan is a serious person. She is making a very serious claim. So within a few hours of our interview last night, a video of the segment reached 1.3 million people on Facebook and why wouldn't it? The coronavirus pandemic has touched the life of every American and justifiably, people want to know where it came from.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Facebook still doesn't want you to know that, so Facebook suppressed the video presumably on behalf of the Chinese government. Facebook executives made it harder for users to watch our segment. Those who found the video had to navigate a warning of the interview, quote: \"Repeats information about COVID-19 that independent fact checkers say is false.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nInstagram, which Facebook also owns did the same thing. Twitter suspended Dr. Yan's account entirely. It did not explain why, nor did the tech companies explain how they would know more about disease transmission than an MD, PhD virologist like Dr. Li-Meng Yan.\u00a0\u00a0\nInstead, Facebook and Instagram linked to three so-called fact checks that supposedly proved Yan was lying. But if you clicked on the provided links, you'd notice something odd.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe fact checks were all published months ago, many months -- in January, February and March, and they had nothing whatsoever to do with what Dr. Li- Meng Yan said on our show. They were written before in fact, anyone knew who she was.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of the fact checks attack a completely unrelated claim. The virus was patented and the vaccine was prepared and ready to go. What does it have to do with the interview that we did last night? No one will tell us that.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe truth is and you know it if you've watched carefully, experts have been wrong frequently throughout this pandemic. At one point, they told us not to wear masks. Now, they tell us we must and so on.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey have changed their prescriptions many times. Most of these are not bad people, most of them are trying their best, but they're human beings, and therefore they're fallible. They make mistakes.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe solution to this age-old problem and we used to understand this intuitively, is more informed voices in the conversation. That's how you make wise decisions. That's how you get to the truth.\u00a0\u00a0\nDiversity of view. Facebook, doesn't believe this. They believe in censorship. Censorship does not make us wiser. It does not make us better informed. If it did, we'd be speaking Russian right now, the Soviet Union would run the world, it would have worked. But instead the Soviet Union is extinct. It collapsed under the weight of its own absurdities, absurdities abetted by censorship.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd that's the most basic lesson of dictatorships, all of them. Anything built on lies falls apart over time.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnfortunately, dictators never see it that way. Dictators care about power.\u00a0\nAnything that stands in the way of their power must be crushed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWatch Facebook leader Mark Zuckerberg back in April explain that any challenges to the party line on coronavirus will be censored immediately.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nMARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:\u00a0 If someone is spreading something that puts people in imminent risk of physical harm, then we take that down. We don't allow that on Facebook.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are also other misinformation that may not lead to physical -- imminent risk of physical harm, but still isn't the type of stuff we want to be spreading through our system.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Misinformation can't be allowed to spread through our system, Zuckerberg declared. So what exactly you may be wondering constitutes misinformation? What's the definition of that? Well, in practice, misinformation according to Facebook is anything that's suggests our health authorities and Democratic politicians are incompetent. Also anything that embarrasses Big Tech allies and the communist government of China.\u00a0\u00a0\nInformation like that is misinformation and it must be censored, not for your benefit. It doesn't help you at all, but for theirs, to solidify their power. So in July, Facebook and Twitter took down a video on news site, Breitbart, of several practicing physicians, frontline doctors, pointing out that hydroxychloroquine could help coronavirus patients.\u00a0\u00a0\nListen carefully to what the doctors say in this video.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 This is a treatment regimen that's very simple, and it should be in the hands of the American people. The difficult aspect of this is that at the moment, because of politics, it's being blocked from doctors prescribing it and it is being blocked from pharmacists releasing it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey've been empowered to overrule the doctor's opinion. I'm in favor of it being over the counter. Give it to the people.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 That's true. Our authorities aren't pro-choice when it comes to hydroxychloroquine and it's true that many practicing physicians have used it.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Facebook declared that video could not be allowed. You were not allowed to see it, because those claims constituted dangerous misinformation, which irony of ironies was itself dangerous misinformation.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn July, the same month that video was posted, researchers at Henry Ford Health Systems in Southeast Michigan found that early administration of hydroxychloroquine made hospitalized patients substantially less likely to die.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese aren't politicians. They are not tech executives, they're physicians and that's what they found in their clinical practice. But none of that mattered to the 25-year-old Humanities major staffing Facebook's fact checking division. They decided you absolutely could not see that video because it questioned the status quo.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut in a way in doing that, in censoring that information, Facebook was its most honest. The video was dangerous. It was dangerous to the same elites who view democracy as a threat to their monopoly on information.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Give it to the people,\" the physician says in the video. Nothing could be more dangerous to Silicon Valley than democratizing access to the truth.\u00a0\nSomething they believe they have a monopoly on.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlphabet, which owns the search engine, Google, a monopoly if there ever was one and the video sharing site, YouTube same thing, is even more protective of its complete stranglehold on information, which it has.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn April, they took down a video from Dr. Dan Erickson. He said he was being pressured to indicate that patients were dying of coronavirus when in fact, they died because of other causes.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany physicians have said that. It also cast doubt on the need for universal social distancing. Here's what he said specifically. Watch.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nDR. DAN ERICKSON, BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA:\u00a0 We aren't pressured to test for flu. But ER doctors now, my friends that I talk to say, you know, it's interesting when I'm writing up my death report, I'm being pressured to add COVID. Why is that?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy are we being pressured to add COVID? To maybe increase the numbers and make it look a little bit worse than it is? I think so.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 This is a physician practicing Medicine. Count the number of lectures you've received from Democratic politicians and tech executives, we need to let physicians decide -- between a woman and her doctor. Oh, no, not in this case. You can't see that.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd by the way, if they're willing to take that off the internet, if they're willing to censor that, prevent you from seeing it, what are they going to do with the election results a month and a half from now? Think about that for a minute.\u00a0\u00a0\nYouTube said the video you just saw must be censored because it quote, \"explicitly disputed the efficacy of local health authority recommended guidance.\" Notice they didn't even bother trying to claim that Dr. Erickson was saying something false.\u00a0\u00a0\nNo. They just said he contradicted guidance from unnamed bureaucrats in the government. Talk about state media. This is what state media looks like.\u00a0\nDemanding you must believe some unelected bureaucrat from the state. Taking his word over practicing physician's work.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore recently, YouTube censored a video from Dr. Scott Atlas. He is a member of the White House Coronavirus Taskforce joining us in a moment. Dr.\u00a0\nAtlas argue that maybe we don't need universal social distancing measures.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome groups of Americans, Atlas said are not in great danger from the coronavirus, especially young people, and that's obviously true. No serious scientist disputes the accuracy of that statement.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut then Dr. Atlas did what you absolutely cannot do ever in this brave new world they've created. He pointed out that statistical models, those are the models that technocrats use to justify their existence have been catastrophically wrong. Watch him say it.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nDR. SCOTT ATLAS, MEMBER OF WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASKFORCE:\u00a0 The policymakers in general, they put in a lockdown. They didn't care at all, they did not calculate at all the costs of the harms of the lockdown and the consequences of the lockdown.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey did a stop COVID-19 at all costs and they used hypothetical projection models that were so egregiously wrong. Far, far off, yet they keep citing those models.\u00a0\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Even now.\u00a0\u00a0\nATLAS:\u00a0 Even now, and so the extension of the lockdown is the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 So this is why that should scare you. That wasn't allowed by our tech overlords, and yet, no one disputes that what Dr. Atlas said in the clip you just saw is true.\u00a0\u00a0\nLook it up and verify it, assuming you're still allowed to and because it is true, we will continue to say it and things like it. Period. FOX News believes in free speech and we plan to exercise ours. We're allowed to do that because unlike the majority of news organizations in America, we are not beholden to Facebook and YouTube for our revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd as long as that's true, we're going to report and we're going to let you decide.\u00a0\u00a0\nDr. Scott Atlas is a member of the White House Taskforce on coronavirus, as noted and we're happy to have him on tonight.\u00a0\u00a0\nDoctor, thanks so much for coming on. Let me ask you a broad question to start. What does it do to the practice of science, when certain areas of inquiry are off limits or censored?\u00a0\u00a0\nATLAS:\u00a0 Yes, well, thanks for having me, Tucker. It's a disaster. I mean, we've already seen the near destruction of objective journalism. When you start censoring science, you're removing, you know, facts. You're really removing the basic way we decide what is truth and what's not, and you know, this has been done, I think, historically, in various countries.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut, you know, we're sort of teetering on the edge of what is done in third world countries here. The countries we used to be proudly distinguished from.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe need to have a reliable news media. We need to have scientists who are able to question -- I mean, in the beginning, as I sort of pointed out in one of my tweets, people used to think that the Earth was the center of the solar system. Okay, the Earth was flat.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut these things actually are proven and we ought to be able to accept differences in science and go forward and prove it. And you know, frankly, a lot of the stuff that is said, as you pointed out is not even disputing the science.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe have a bunch of people in this country now and we are really at the hysterical end of things that you know, somehow it's all about the science, it's all about the science. But when you cite the science and it disagrees with what those people's impressions of the science are, you are deemed -- you're not allowed to go on.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd so you know, when you say it's all about the science, you better know the science, you better understand the science and then you better say things that are consistent with the science.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Where are the brave scientists and physicians and researchers?\u00a0\nWhere are the people who are going to uphold the essential principle of free inquiry that we need to function as a country? Why aren't people flipping out about this? Why isn't the head of Memorial Sloan Kettering, you know, staging a hunger strike until this garbage stops? A sincere question.\u00a0\u00a0\nATLAS:\u00a0 Yes. Well, I mean, I have to say that, you know, despite what people think, there's a big backlash going on.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 I hope.\u00a0\u00a0\nATLAS:\u00a0 You know, I receive thousands of e-mails a week from people all over the world, including hundreds a week from medical scientists and the like and they were afraid to step forward.\u00a0\u00a0\nI think this sort of move to censor people like me, and others, I'm not just talking about myself, really has precipitated a backlash here. We saw it in the media. Now, lots of things have been written, talking about what I said and how outrageous it is that that stuff was censored, or even, you know, an interest by some of my former colleagues and censoring me by public shaming or cancellation.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou know, these kinds of things are really destructive and harmful. Not only is it wrong in terms of the truth, it's also instilling fear into the public and we are right now in a pandemic here. We have people who are so afraid, they can't even function. We need to be able to allow the debates.\u00a0\nWe need to be able to look at people who can articulate the science and interpret it, take everything into context and move forward.\u00a0\u00a0\nI think Americans do not want to be afraid. They do not want to see the sort of chaotic discussion where you're canceled if you disagree. There are legitimate people like me, but they're also experts coast to coast. I'm talking about colleagues of mine, who are actually rational from Stanford, Harvard, UCLA all over the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nI speak to these people all the time. I just had -- I had a conversation with a Nobel Prize winner in Structural Biology tonight about these sorts of things. This is very frightening and we need to have this debate or the facts be able to be presented.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, we need mass resistance to this. We need brave people to stand up. And you're, of course one of them and we're grateful you were on tonight. Thank you, Dr. Scott Atlas.\u00a0\u00a0\nATLAS:\u00a0 Thank you. Thanks a lot.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 One of the rare Members of Congress who has thought a lot about the effect of Big Tech monopolies on our society and our freedoms is Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who joins us tonight. We're happy to have him. Senator, thanks so much for coming on.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou have been, to your credit, been warning about this for quite some time.\u00a0\nClearly, a dystopia has arrived. We are fewer than two months from a presidential election. These companies have a hammerlock on our information about that election.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat can we do to throw off their control and restore freedom of speech and thought and inquiry in this country before then? Is there anything?\u00a0\u00a0\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MI):\u00a0 We can let people sue, Tucker, and we can let people like Dr. Atlas sue when YouTube takes his videos down, Dr. Yan when her Twitter account gets canceled, she is de-platformed, we can let her sue.\u00a0\u00a0\nRight now they can't. They can't sue. Nobody can. If you get discriminated against on the basis of speech by these platforms, you have no recourse because of a law that Congress has written. This is the heart of the sweetheart deal that Big Tech gets from big government and it is time to end it. That's how we can get their attention and that's how we can give power to individuals and users and Americans and take power away from Big Tech.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Amen. And of course, the trial bar, an unlikely ally, would join that that I have to ask -- I've asked this before -- who is standing in the way of such an obvious and much needed solution?\u00a0\u00a0\nHAWLEY:\u00a0 Oh, the Washington establishment, much of which Big Tech owns. I mean, Big Tech has shelled out enormous sums of cash to buy influence in Washington, I have to say, it's been very successful.\u00a0\u00a0\nI've seen that with my own eyes on Capitol Hill. They have bought influence with think tanks. They have bought influence with groups, including conservative groups all over town. They've tried to influence members of Congress staff. It is unbelievable the juggernaut that they have, Big Tech has.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut you know what? The American people are tired, I think of Big Tech having all the power and them having none. The American people having none and they're demanding change, Tucker, and that's ultimately what's going to get politicians attention.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere's nothing that politicians respond to like voters and that's why as voters say, we've had enough of this. We're tired of being told what to think, what we can say, what we can read. We're tired of Big Tech, the capital of woke telling us how to live our lives.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe want to make those decisions for ourselves. Voters are demanding change.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 This election this November could be a legitimate historic disaster, thanks in part to these tech companies. Truly. That's when it could get very frightening and I hope a solution arises before then.\u00a0\u00a0\nSenator Hawley, thanks so much for the work you've done on this.\u00a0\u00a0\nHAWLEY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Well, there's been an awful lot of confusion this week in the Joe Biden for President Campaign. We report this with no glee, just concern.\u00a0\u00a0\nSimple questions like what office is Joe Biden running for proving tough to answer. We'll show you the videos after the break.\u00a0\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 At a virtual roundtable on Monday with Arizona business owners, Joe Biden's running mate let the mask slip for a moment and forgot to pretend that it's actually Joe Biden who is running for President. It's all on video. Watch. It is pretty, pretty amazing.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nSEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 A Harris administration together with Joe Biden as the President of the United States, the Biden-Harris administration --\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 A Harris administration together with Joe Biden as the President, of course. It's unbelievable. It's like the warm up act pretending.\u00a0 So the headliners, pretty humiliating.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo you might expect Joe Biden would be annoyed by this, but he wasn't fazed in the slightest, assuming he understood what happened. In fact, Joe Biden appears to believe that he is in fact running for Vice President. This is real footage from yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nJOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 The Harris-Biden administration is going to relaunch that effort and keep pushing further to make it easier for military spouses of veterans to find meaningful careers.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 The Harris-Biden ministration. It's worth noting that Joe Biden appears to be reading from a teleprompter, naturally, as he said those words, so maybe the campaign has just gone ahead and made it official.\u00a0\nMaybe this is how they're fighting the patriarchy. It's the Harris-Biden ticket. Joe Biden is just along for the ride.\u00a0\u00a0\nJudge Jeanine Pirro is a FOX News host, author of the book, \"Don't Lie to Me\" and stop trying to steal our freedom. We're happy to have her on tonight. Judge, thanks for coming on.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo is it better just to be honest about it and say, yes, I mean, it's the -\n- it's the Kamala or however we're pronouncing her name now. Hey, it's the Harris-Biden administration. Does that work?\u00a0\u00a0\nJEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE:\u00a0 That's right. That's right. Well, you know, there are Freudian slips, Tucker, that are accidental; and then there are slips that are not inadvertent. And the fact that she says, you know, the Harris administration with Joe Biden, you know, as President, it's clear, I mean, she knows what she is saying.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd then you have to say to yourself, wait a minute, has this been the plan all along? Like what's going on behind closed doors? And what are they not telling us? And maybe President Trump was right when he talked about Joe Biden being the Trojan horse in the election.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd it's really more interesting when the next day, I think, it's 24 hours later, Joe Biden comes out and he says, yes, the Harris-Biden administration and he is reading a teleprompter, but it doesn't connect, which is a sad comment on his mental acuity.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo neither of them really correct it, but they just kind of go along with it. And you have to wonder, has this been the plan all along? So, it is just crazy.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Well, maybe after she said it and kind of laid down the marker after she announced in public, it is, in fact, the Harris-Biden administration, that he decided to be sexist to try and correct her and just kind of had to roll with it at that point.\u00a0\u00a0\nPIRRO:\u00a0 Oh, yes, yes, you're probably right. And probably Joe Biden said to himself, I've got to be careful about this patriarchy and make it matriarchy. Yes, you've got it, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 It is so awesome when they have to follow the rolls. So Kamala Harris also said that she is proud of Jacob Blake. That's the guy who was shot after fighting with the police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Apparently, he was going for his knife when he was shot.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe even met with Jacob Blake's family last week. Here's a clip of Kamala Harris after that meeting. Watch.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nHARRIS:\u00a0 They're an incredible family and what they've endured and they just do it with such dignity and grace and you know, they're carrying the weight of a lot of voices on their shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0\nQUESTION:\u00a0 And what was the message that you shared with him and his family?\u00a0\u00a0\nHARRIS:\u00a0 Just one to express concern for their, you know, wellbeing and of course, for their brother and their sense of wellbeing, and to let them know that they have support.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 So as we told you, Jacob Blake's father is like a lunatic actually, read his social media posts and a totally open bigot. Kamala Harris apparently doesn't think anything about it. In fact, she thinks that's worth praising.\u00a0\u00a0\nMeanwhile, she has not visited the families of the LA Sheriff's Deputies who just shot in the face on Saturday in Compton. Why do you think that is, Judge? Why isn't she taking time out of her busy schedule in the Harris administration to visit the families of those Deputies?\u00a0\u00a0\nPIRRO:\u00a0 Let me make the facts clear on Jacob Blake in case anyone forgot them. There was an outstanding warrant for Jacob Blake when the police were called on August 23rd, the day that he was shot. That outstanding open warrant was for felony sexual assault, trespassing, and domestic violence.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe day that Jacob Blake went to that scene where he was ultimately arrested, he -- there was an order from the court prohibiting him from being at that scene.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe stole car keys from the individual that he had previously been accused of molesting and for whom an order of protection had been issued. He was told to drop a knife and he did not drop the knife. He had one of the police officers in a headlock. He ended up being shot.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow for Kamala Harris, let's make one thing clear. She was a DA and she was the Attorney General of the State of California. When you're in law enforcement, it's in your blood, you do not lose it. But this woman is a chameleon. She changes from pro-law enforcement to pro-criminal.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe fact that she would visit that family and talk to them about how wonderful they are, and I'm not even talking about Compton yet. She didn't visit the victim in that case. The victim was hysterical. She was crying.\u00a0\nShe was worried about her own children. I mean, this was a nightmare scenario for her that was repeated again.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, let's go to Compton. You've got two cops. One who is a woman with a six-year-old child. The other is a recent rookie, a graduate from the rookie school. The fact that she wouldn't make a phone call or even talk about them indicates a side that she has taken.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe's in favor of Black Lives Matter. She's anti-law enforcement. She's in favor of defunding the police. Her silence in this situation where people are hoping that police die, they are supporting the massacre, the attempted murder of these two officers tells me that her silence is acceptance and for the American -- for all of us, it tells us what's coming in a Harris- Biden administration.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 You make a very good point.\u00a0\u00a0\nPIRRO:\u00a0 This is a woman who despises law enforcement.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 She supports Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter has endorsed the murder of police officers. I mean, it's kind of that simple. And thank you for reminding us of that because that's true.\u00a0\u00a0\nPIRRO:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Judge Jeanine Pirro, great to see you.\u00a0\u00a0\nPIRRO:\u00a0 It is true and it's -- thank you. Good to be on, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 If you've got kids in school, you'll know that schools are suddenly completely out of control. One elementary school we're going to tell you about tonight has told kids that their parents are racists if they support the police. One of those parents joins us after the break.\u00a0\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Gladwyne Elementary School in Pennsylvania outside Philadelphia is now requiring fourth and fifth graders to read something called \"Not My\nIdea: A Book about Whiteness.\" It teaches children that their parents are racist if they defend the police or complain about protesters who are blocking the road.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe book also says that people who don't watch media reports about police shootings are complicit in racism. The school's Cultural Proficiency Committee has mandated several other programs for young children, including classes that teach kindergarteners that just asking other people questions can be racist.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Lower Merion School District which includes Gladwyne Elementary. It's one of the richest school districts in the nation and they responded to us this way, quote: \"The Lower Merion School District fully supports the ongoing implementation of an anti-racist curriculum in its schools and encourages the use of developmentally appropriate books that raise awareness of the very real issues of racism and privilege.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIn other words, \"Up yours. This is what we're doing.\" So why are parents allowing schools to teach their own children to hate them for the color of their skin?\u00a0\u00a0\nElana Fishbein is the mother of a student who attended Gladwyne Elementary.\u00a0\nShe since moved out that child out of the district for obvious reasons. She joins us tonight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThanks so much for coming on. I appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo tell us your experience with this school and what our viewers may not know, it is a fairly well-known school district and known for having excellent schools. But you moved your child out. Why?\u00a0\u00a0\nELANA FISHBEIN, CONCERNED PARENT:\u00a0 Indeed, in fact, many people move to our area because of the quality of the education in public schools.\u00a0\u00a0\nActually, I have two kids there. Last year, they were second grade and fourth grade, and this has been going on now for a while. This is not something new that started right now.\u00a0\u00a0\nLittle by little, the school has been introducing different subjects that we were concerned about. And I raised my concern with the principal, with teachers, with the counselors, and they kind of brushed it off.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut just before the end of the school year, literally two days before the end of the school year, as a result of all the unrest and riots, they introduced what as you rightfully called, a cultural proficiency curriculum and a lesson plan.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd that lesson plan included the books that you mentioned as well as others. And when my husband and I were looking at the program, we were totally alarmed and obviously, we opted our kids out of the lessons.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the school year finished, we wrote a letter to the Superintendent of our Lower Merion School District, as well as to the principal and the School Board and they totally ignored us.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn that letter, we actually questioned the validity of this kind of teaching and emphasizing that in fact, this teaching, turned Martin Luther King's teaching upside down.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Yes. That's right.\u00a0\u00a0\nFISHBEIN:\u00a0 All of those years, there have been teaching our kids about the beautiful philosophy of Martin Luther King's and they were rejoicing in this kind of teaching. And all of a sudden, this is totally turning it upside down.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0\nFISHBEIN:\u00a0 And we received no reply to our concern and therefore, I decided a few weeks later to post my letter to the Superintendent on the Facebook of the parents' school Facebook page and I was totally taken by the harsh criticism.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd in fact, in some places, I told them that they are like lynching me of some parents. And these kinds of criticism, and obviously, as you know, the kind of name they call us, racist, not in our school, et cetera.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe interesting thing though and that's what launched -- that's what created our movement, the interesting thing is that those were the vocal voices. I received at the same time, a lot of e-mails and messages from grandparents and families that supported me, but also at the same time, the thread throughout those messages was, we are afraid to talk. We are afraid to resist.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Well, thank God that you weren't. And by the way, all of those good liberals love immigrants until they're disobedient, I noticed and then they attack you.\u00a0\u00a0\nElana Fishbein, thank you so much for telling your story on our show and for your bravery. We need more of it -- much more of it. Appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0\nFISHBEIN:\u00a0 I hope I can just mention that we created the movement called No Left Turn in Education, and you can find us on Facebook as well as in the internet. It is very simple to remember. It is a traffic sign of no left turn. No left turn in education.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Amen. Elana Fishbein, thanks.\u00a0\u00a0\nWell, kind of a hilarious moment on the campaign trail yesterday, Joe Biden trying to woo Hispanic voters in Florida with the help of his cell phone and a song about sex.\u00a0\u00a0\nMark Steyn watching avidly from home joins us next to assess how it went.\u00a0\nWe will be right back.\u00a0\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Yesterday, in an event in Florida, Joe Biden's handlers gave him something called a cell phone and told him to play a song by the name of \"Despacito.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nBIDEN:\u00a0 I just have one thing to say. Hang on, everybody. All right.\u00a0\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 There you go. Dance a little bit, Joe. Come on.\u00a0\u00a0\nBIDEN:\u00a0 I'll tell you what, if I had the talent of any one of these people I'd be -- I'd be elected President by acclamation.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Hold on here, says Joe Biden. Not clear if Joe Biden speaks Spanish, but if he did, he will know the lyrics include this quote, \"I want you to breathe your neck slowly. Let me tell you things in your ears.\" No question one of Joe Biden's favorite songs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat was more authentic, though, than when Elizabeth Warren discovered beer and her husband, remember?\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):\u00a0 Hold on a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.\u00a0\nHey, my husband Bruce is now in here. You want a beer?\u00a0\u00a0\nBRUCE MANN, HUSBAND OF SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN:\u00a0 No, I'll pass on the beer for now.\u00a0\u00a0\nWARREN:\u00a0 I'm going to pull that stool and sit down.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Falsest thing that's ever happened in human history? Close, but the prize goes to the Democratic Party's Grand Master of Falseness, the great Gospel singer, Hillary Clinton.\u00a0\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 I don't feel no ways tired. I've come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me that the road would be easy.\u00a0\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 He's just sick and tired of being sick and tired. Preach it, Hillary. They'll say anything. Mark Steyn only says what he believes and that's why we let him. Mark Steyn, who is the falsest person in the Democratic Party?\u00a0\u00a0\nMARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST:\u00a0 Well, let's eliminate Elizabeth Warren, because I'm effete sinister, rootless foreigner and I can do a -- I'm going to get me a beer -- that's better than Elizabeth Warren, so she is out immediately.\u00a0\u00a0\nJoe Biden playing a song that he never heard of until he stepped out on stage by an artist he has never heard on until he stepped out on stage, that's actually a lot of what the Democratic problem was last time.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou recall the night before the election. They had that big rally with Jay- Z and all the cool cats in Philadelphia and it didn't work for them.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe best reaction to this in fairness is George W. Bush, 20 years ago, he was asked to take a pop test and the first question was, what do you think of Madonna? And he said, I'm not into pop music. That's what a healthy secure man in his late 70s like Biden would do.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's completely -- and by the way, it's not good for the pop stars, too.\u00a0\nThe gold standard, again, 20 years ago Al Gore went up to Courtney Love of the pop group, Hole, I think it was at that time, and said, \"I am a big fan.\" And she said, \"Yes, right, Al. Name a song.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nNo self-respecting popstar wants to be pandered to by geezer politicians.\u00a0\nAnd so -- and again, I'll give you one more, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe gold standard on this, 1956, Sinatra gives a speech at the Democratic Convention in favor of Adlai Stevenson. No one remembers a word of the speech, but at the end of it, Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of the House, third most powerful man in American politics claps his hand on Sinatra shoulder, and Sinatra with the microphone still on says, \"Hands off the threads, creep.\" hands off the threads, creep, is actually a better attitude for the celebrity class than pandering to these politicians. It's not good for either of them.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 If you write a memoir, and we're praying that you do, I hope it will be called \"Hands off the threads, creep.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSTEYN:\u00a0 Right, that would actually be a good show. That would be a good celebrity political show, too, for some enterprising cable that were to launch. That's a good title for it, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Hands off the threads, creep. Oh, I love it so much. Mark Steyn, great to see you. Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\nSTEYN:\u00a0 Thanks a lot, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 Is it possible and Republicans are hoping for this, that there is a silent majority of voters for the current President? Well, there is some information we don't know what's going to happen, but there may be quite a few people who are forming and aren't saying. We have it for you next.\u00a0\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 The worst thing about American politics by far is identity politics, splitting 350 million people into little verticals, little demographics, we hate doing it, but that's the way these things are measured. So we've got to tell you that according to new surveys, the President is now leading Joe Biden -- we didn't expect this -- among Hispanic voters in Florida.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe is also virtually tied with Joe Biden among voters who identify as gay.\u00a0\nI didn't expect that either.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat's changed since 2016?\u00a0\u00a0\nEddie Scarry is the author of the book, \"Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascist Hijacked the Country and Elevated its Worst People.\" Great book, the title is true. Eddie, thanks for coming on. These are big changes. What accounts for them, do you think?\u00a0\u00a0\nEDDIE SCARRY, AUTHOR:\u00a0 I think that like many other voters, I mean, like you were just saying I hate to segment people into different identities and who is black and who is gay and who is -- but I think that it's a lot of the same thing that we're looking at -- if we're just talking about gays, we're looking at cities run by Democrats, liberals, states, democratic mayors, Democratic governors, and we're seeing them go up in flames and gay people are kind of inherently afraid of violence for I think reasons that should be obvious.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo I think seeing that has scared a lot of people and they're looking for someone to -- they're looking for protection from somebody and we've seen Joe Biden for the last, I guess two or three months, kind of excuse, if not outright encourage what's been going on.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd then here's -- I want to say that this is a little bit of news, I think for maybe your viewers, if not for you, because you've lived in D.C. for a long time is that the Capitol Hill, meaning the staff on Capitol Hill, not the representatives or the senators, the staff.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe staff is very, actually very gay on both sides. But the Republican side is actually gayer than the Democratic side, and the thing is that the Republican side, and they're very, very discreet about the fact that they're Republicans. So you have these Republicans who finally are coming out and saying, you know what, I'm tired of this. I'm tired of seeing what's going on around the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd you know what, Trump is the one who at least says we've had enough of this, too. So that's what they're looking at.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 I think that's -- I think, in the end, that's what matters. Is this person going to improve my life? Is this person going to really hurt me? I mean, that matters more than any of these stupid symbolic appeals playing dumb tunes on your iPhone or whatever.\u00a0\u00a0\nI think it's a really -- it's a really fair point you make. Eddie Scarry.\u00a0\nThanks a lot for coming on tonight.\u00a0\u00a0\nSCARRY:\u00a0 Thanks, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0\nCARLSON:\u00a0 That's it for us. Amazingly, it went so fast.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe'll be back tomorrow and every night at eight. The show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd guess what's next? That's not all because Sean Hannity takes over live.\u00a0\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, speaks at the 2020 Republican National Convention. Republican members of Congress kicked off the 2020 GOP convention Monday night making the case for President Trump\u2019s re-election, calling the Republican Party the \u201cpro-America party,\u201d and Trump the \u201cpro-America candidate.\u201d Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, spoke directly to voters Monday night, saying that \u201cthis is election is about who can preserve the values, the principles, and institutions that Make America Great.\u201d TRUMP ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF 'USING COVID TO STEAL OUR ELECTION' \u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d Jordan said. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening in America\u2019s cities\u2014all run by Democrats. Crime, violence, mob rule.\u201d \u201cDemocrats refuse to denounce the mob, and their response to the chaos?\u201d Jordan continued. \u201cDefund the police, defund border patrol, defund the military.\u201d Although some Democrats do support defunding the police and border patrol, former vice president Joe Biden has said that he does not. Jordan went on to warn that Democrats are \u201ctrying to take away your guns,\u201d while pointing to some of the positions the left has taken over the last several months. \u201cDemocrats won\u2019t let you go to church, but they\u2019ll let you protest. Democrats won\u2019t let you go to work, but they\u2019ll let you riot,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cDemocrats won\u2019t let you go to school, but they\u2019ll let you loot.\u201d He added: \u201cPresident Trump has fought against each of their crazy ideas. He has taken on the swamp, the Democrats, the press and the Never Trumpers.\u201d \u201cAnd when you take on the swamp,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe swamp fights back.\u201d Jordan went on to list some of the president\u2019s obstacles, political and not, in the last four years, including the \u201cRussia hoax,\u201d former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, and what he called the \u201cfake impeachment.\u201d \u201cBut in spite of this unbelievable opposition, this president has done what he said he would do,\u201d Jordan said, highlighting the president\u2019s record. Meanwhile, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was shot during a congressional baseball practice in 2017 and severely injured, warned that the \u201cleft wants to defund the police.\u201d \u201cThis is personal,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without the bravery and heroism of the men and women in law enforcement who saved my life.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump stands with those brave men and women,\u201d Scalise continued. \u201cJoe Biden has embraced the left\u2019s insane mission to defund them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere won\u2019t be an America to leave to our children and grandchildren without those brave law enforcement officers and first responders.\u201d Scalise went on to slam Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, saying that the former vice president \"has made a career in Washington for 47 years promising things he\u2019s never delivered.\" \"We can\u2019t afford another 47 years of hollow promises,\" Scalise said. And Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., in his address to voters Monday night, Gaetz posed options for the 2020 presidential election. \u201cStrength or weakness; energy or confusion; success or failure,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cAt the Democratic Convention, they promised that they\u2019ll stop the madness. But we didn\u2019t start the fire. And weakness in the White House won\u2019t stop it,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d He said. \u201cHow about not settling for violence in our neighborhoods or at our border? Not settling for second-best to cheating China? And not settling for another round of bad decisions by basement-dwelling Joe Biden?\u201d Gaetz added: \u201cAmericans don\u2019t settle. We advance. We don\u2019t live in basements. We explore the frontier, the horizon and the stars.\u201d Gaetz went on to call America \u201cthe greatest country that has ever existed.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t let any celebrity, athlete or politician tell you otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is not just an idea or a constitution, it is our home.\u201d He added: \u201cWe must protect our home with unbreakable Made-in-America Strength - strength I see every day in President Donald Trump.\u201d Scalise, meanwhile, said that Trump\u2019s \u201cconstant theme\u201d to approaching problems is \u201chow much he cares about the hard-working people that Washington left behind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen this first hand,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cAfter I was shot on a baseball field by a leftist gunman, first responders rushed me to a hospital where I battled for my life.\u201d Scalise recalled the president and first lady Melania Trump coming to the hospital that same night to console his wife. \u201cThey were there for my family in my darkest hours,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cDonald Trump would call to check on me throughout the following weeks, just to see how I was doing.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of person he is. That\u2019s the side of Donald Trump that the media will never show you.\u201d And Jordan said he loves Trump\u2019s \u201cintensity and his willingness to fight every day in Washington for our families.\u201d \u201cBut what I also appreciate is something most Americans never get to see \u2013 how much he truly cares about people,\u201d Jordan said of Trump, sharing a personal family story about his nephew who was killed in a car accident two years ago. Jordan recalled speaking on the phone to the president about a few issues, and then discussed the tragic loss of his nephew. Jordan recalled the president offering to speak with his nephew\u2019s father. \u201cFor the next five minutes, family and friends sat in complete silence, as the President of the United States took time to talk to a dad who was hurting,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the president I\u2019ve gotten to know the last four years.\u201d \u201cA president who has shared private moments like this with soldiers, victims of violent crime, people who\u2019ve had businesses destroyed by the mob,\u201d Jordan continued. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s the individual who\u2019s Made America Great Again and who knows America\u2019s best days are still in front of us. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m busting my tail to help him get re-elected. I\u2019m asking you to do the same.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Some political insiders say Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has drifted away from the conservative bloc, providing hope for Democrats and angering Republicans. In a television interview scheduled to air Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence tears into U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, calling him a \u201cdisappointment to conservatives.\u201d The vice president\u2019s comments \u2013 made during a discussion with Christian broadcaster CBN News \u2013 follow several cases before the court in which Roberts, a 2005 appointee of former President George W. Bush, has sided with the court\u2019s liberals in majority opinions. \u201cWe have great respect for the institution of the Supreme Court of the United States but Chief Justice Roberts has been a disappointment to conservatives,\u201d Pence told CBN\u2019s David Brody, according to the network\u2019s website. CUCCINELLI GIVES SUPREME COURT 'TWO ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP' FOR LATEST BORDER WALL DECISION \u201cI think several cases out of the Supreme Court are reminders of just how important this election is for the future of the Supreme Court,\u201d the vice president added. Vice President Mike Pence, left, had some sharp words regarding U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts during a TV interview scheduled to air Thursday. Pence pointed in particular to Roberts voting in 2012 to uphold ObamaCare, a more recent decision to uphold Nevada\u2019s coronavirus-related limits on church gatherings and a Louisiana case that determined whether abortion-clinic doctors should have admitting privileges at local hospitals, CBN reported. Regarding the Louisiana case, Pence called it a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for pro-life voters. \u201cThat\u2019s a very modest restriction on abortion providers,\u201d Pence told Brody. \u201cBut a narrow majority in the Supreme Court still said it was unacceptable. I think it\u2019s been a wake-up call for pro-life voters around the country who understand, in a very real sense, the destiny of the Supreme Court is on the ballot in 2020.\u201d RUTH BADER GINSBURG DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER PROCEDURE EARLIER THIS WEEK Future openings on the Supreme Court have been a topic of speculation in recent years as Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, deals with increasingly frequent health-related issues \u2013 spurring talk of her possible retirement \u2013 and other members of the court advance in age. Ginsburg is the oldest member of the court, followed by Associate Justices Stephen Breyer, who will turn 82 on Aug. 15; Clarence Thomas, who is 72; and Samuel Alito, who is 70. The remaining members of the court, including Roberts, are all younger than 70. Pence has been in what might be described as \u201cattack mode\u201d in recent days, with sharp critiques targeting New York\u2019s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Democrats serving on the House Judiciary Committee. In a Monday night appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d Pence fired back after Cuomo said the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic needed a \u201creset\u201d from the \u201ctop.\u201d (Pence heads President Trump\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force.) \u201cOur\u00a0hearts grieve for the fact that\u00a01-in-5 of all the American\u00a0lives that have been lost in the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic were lost\u00a0in the State of New York,\u201d Pence told host Laura Ingraham, \"and\u00a0some of that was because of poor\u00a0decisions by the state and by Governor Cuomo.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Then on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Story\u201d on Tuesday, Pence told host Martha MacCallum that the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democrats \u2013 including panel Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York -- were grandstanding during a recent hearing with Attorney General William Barr. \u201cBill Barr\u00a0is leading the Justice\u00a0Department in this country with\u00a0great integrity and brings a lifetime commitment to the rule\u00a0of law,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cBut to see it today, in the\u00a0little bit that I was able to\u00a0watch, it was clear that the\u00a0Democrats wanted to hear\u00a0themselves talk more than they\u00a0wanted to hear from the\u00a0attorney general of the\u00a0United States.\u201d The complete CBN News interview with Pence is scheduled to air Thursday on the network\u2019s \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d program.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" November 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d from Washington tonight. As day two of the Democratic Convention has just come to a merciful end. Well, tonight, we set remarks from everyone from AOC to Jill Biden, Chuck Schumer, Stacey Abrams, some other featured guests will dissect in a moment. But just under an hour ago, Joe Biden officially clinched a nomination for the celebration that was right for, I don't know, Saturday Night Live. Tonight, we break down what you may have missed with Ben Shapiro, Mike Huckabee, Mercedes Schlapp, Tom Bevan, Raymond Arroyo, and a lot more. Also, her ad went viral for good reason. Tonight, Republican, Kimberly Klacik, is here exclusively to tell us why she thinks she made Baltimore an example to other Democrat-run cities. But first, another night of Democrats doing everything in their power to avoid telling you what their real plans are if the country actually picks Joe Biden. They trot it out a bunch of old familiar faces in a desperate attempt to reassure Midwest voters that Biden will govern as a moderate. However, after watching tonight's speakers' lineup, every American should be alarmed. It was a veritable who's who of failures, each of whom have done immense damage to our country. Now, let's start with this blast from the past. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: When I ran for president in 1976, Joe Biden was my first and most effective supporter in the Senate. He I understand dignity, our essential rights, determine not only our vision, but our actions, more than ever that's what we need. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, God bless them, but are Democrats really trying to harken back to the days of double-digit unemployment inflation and, of course, Jimmy Carter's malaise? Now, what's that say about their platform today? Now, Carter's biggest accomplishment was getting Ronald Reagan elected president. Tonight's lineup was kind of a time warp amalgam. It's what it would have looked like if both parties held a joint convention in, let's say, 2004. First up, John Kerry is still reporting for duty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: For the eight years of the Obama-Biden administration, we led by example, we eliminated the threat of an Iran with a nuclear weapon. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, John Kerry is best known for windsurfing, sending pallets of cash to Iranians and secretly advising that murderous regime behind the backs of the President and the State Department. But sure, he really cares about Americans. Oh, wait, wait, there's one more. Another night, another former Republican. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLIN POWELL, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I support Joe Biden because beginning on day one, he will restore American's leadership and our moral authority. He'll be a president who knows that America is strongest when, as he has said, we lead both by the power of our example, and the example of our power. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: First, he's endorsing Biden is the most un-shocking thing to have happened in the last year. OK. He backed Obama twice, and Hillary in 2016. And he's a nice man and a patriot. He served his country, obviously. But Colin Powell talking about the example of our power, really? Well, America has turned away from the interventionist neocons of yesteryear, the Dems trot out one of the masterminds behind Iraq. You remember the one that wasted trillions of dollars and sent thousands of Americans to their deaths and a quixotic search for WMDs? Is this how Joe's foreign policy would be shaped? Now, the race to the bottom didn't end there. Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, she also made an appearance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALLY YATES, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: Ten days in, I was fired for refusing to defend President Trump's shameful and unlawful Muslim travel ban. That was the start of his relentless attacks on our democratic institutions and countless dedicated public servants. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Wait, attacks on our democratic institutions. This is the woman who President Trump fired for putting open borders above the American people. And she helped weaponized the DOJ against the Trump campaign. But last but not least, was Bill Clinton, who uttered the one of the least aware lines of the night and that's saying something. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it's a storm center. There's only chaos. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Why is that? I don't think you should ever talk about the Oval Office. The manager in the Oval Office into a mini Playboy Mansion probably shouldn't be lecturing Americans about what it should symbolize. He forever disgraced the office of the presidency with his sleazy political arrangements that continued after he left the White House. Now, just today, a new pic was revealed showing Bill Clinton getting a massage from one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers. Hmm. So, I asked, are these really the luminaries that Democrats think best represent their party? The folks, you Americans want that close to power again. Now, if so, then the choice in November should be an easy one. But we want to go back to the days of economic calamity, malaise, and endless wars, or do we want to continue the unprecedented prosperity, strong borders, and American renewal of the Trump era? Here with reaction tonight two of the DNC's, Mike Huckabee, former 2016 GOP presidential candidate, Fox News contributor. Also with me, is Ben Shapiro, editor in chief of the Daily Wire and author of \"How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps.\" Alright, Gov. The Democrats, it was like -- it was kind of like an old home week. I think they have some focus group that they've done that shows them that the Midwest is terrified of AOC and the gang and terrified of these, the riots and the looting. So, they wanted to bring back the year 2004 or so or go back to 1978 to reassure Americans? Explain. MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, they put out their greatest hits album tonight, that's the best way you can look at it. And if America was electing somebody to be nice, they would elect Jill Biden, she would be the better Biden to be on the ballot. But that's not what this is about. This is about very serious policies that determine the future of our country. So, if you like the idea of open borders, bigger taxes, more statism, government control of your lives, abortion funded by the taxpayers, if you'd like us surrendering to China at every turn, so the multinational corporations will be happy and keep putting baksheesh in the hands of politicians, then the Democrats are your choice. That's what you should do. If you like us surrendering to Iran and delivering pallets of cash, and if you think somehow that we'd be a whole lot better off in this country, if we let mobs run freely in our cities, and beat the snot out of innocent people driving through a street, the Democrats are your choice. But if you think that America deserves better than that, and we ought to build an economy that's based on unabashed capitalism, if you think that the values of this country should value every single human being, if you think we should control our borders and the other things, then President Trump should be reelected in a landslide, and that's what the American people will be deciding on. Not the sweet packages that we saw tonight in videos, but whether or not this country moves to the far, far left with the Green New Deal and its nonsense, or whether we have some sanity in our policies. INGRAHAM: Now, I mentioned how Bill Clinton had one of the least aware lines of the night. Well, this moment might actually match it. Elizabeth Warren, now, without a hint of irony, participating in the DNC's Native American caucus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MA: Supporting the Democrats, so that we can all continue our work for Indian country. It is more important now than ever. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have always truly been an incredible friend, and more than kind in terms of your work with me and with any country, we all know where your hearts at. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But do we know where that, you know, legacy DNA? You know, experiment is that, Ben. What was that all about? BEN SHAPIRO, CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: A lot of high cheekbones going on right there. I mean, that's very exciting stuff. We know that the powwow chow aficionado was definitely the person to bring into that particular convention amalgam. Bizarre night for the Democrats, Joe Biden, I thought was a good expositor of her husband's personal virtues. But the problem is that all of the Democrats basically has and I was a bunch of old retread hypocrites who really didn't do wonderful jobs while they were on the hook. Again, you're hearing Bill Clinton talk about the various uses of the oval office when he was nailing interns in there is a weird look. It's also weird to hear that from the Me Too party. It was very weird to see John Kerry being trotted out as a foreign policy success the same week that the Trump administration brokered, maybe one of the most historic Middle East peace deals in the history of modern Middle Eastern politics between Israel and the UAE and now Sudan and Oman, and Bahrain. It's very weird to try it out the epic failure that was John Kerry, the worst secretary of state of my lifetime, including Hillary Clinton. It was very weird when they're trying out Sally Yates, who literally described herself as astonished, that Barack Obama knew about the developments in the -- in the Michael Flynn case before she did and that James Comey was not conveying a full information to the Obama administration. She was being brought out to talk about challenges to America's institutions. It was a very, very strange evening. If this is the best that the Democrats had going all the way back to Jimmy Carter, it doesn't really recommend a lot. All it really says they are desperately trying to avoid the implication that AOC is the rising star. She hit every single term on my crazy socialist bingo card within one minute, which was an impressive achievement. INGRAHAM: Yes. And Governor Huckabee, the biggest threat to America's security, China, was referenced so quickly, I could barely even get what it was, it was something ridiculous like the Trump is helping China. It was absurd. But that in and of itself, the fact that they did not address China head on tonight and their big foreign policy guru night, I think that told you everything you needed to know about Joe Biden, and why China wants him to be president so badly. HUCKABEE: Well, I think that's why John Ratcliffe, the Director of National Intelligence, has said that the biggest threat to the election interference is China, not Russia this time. And I think he's right. And the reason Joe Biden and the Democrats are not going to push back against China is because, let's face it, Joe's got some issues here taking Hunter over there with him $1-1/2-billion deal that Hunter, his son, got with China. And the fact is that the establishment politicians, there are some Republicans in this too. So let's not act like that the Republicans are pure, because a lot of them are also beholden to China, to the multinational corporations that have made a bunch of money losing and costing Americans their jobs and their futures, so that China could get rich and a handful of corporate snobs could get rich. President Trump has had the guts to stand up for America and Americans. And that's why they're not going to talk about China, but President Trump will, he needs to and thank God he is because somebody is finally standing up for the United States of America. INGRAHAM: Yes. The Biden administration, God help us if that ever happens, is going to lift all the tariffs off China, not even require anything in return. Gentlemen, great to see you both tonight. Thanks so much. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JILL BIDEN: We have shown that the heart of this nation still beats with kindness and courage. That's the soul of America Joe Biden is fighting for now, because it's not in politicians or political parties, it's in the providence of God. His faith is in you. In us. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Faith is in you. They're trying hard to sell it, but does it work? Is Joe Biden really the faith and family values candidate? When it comes to faith, Biden claims to be a practicing Catholic, but at the same time, he's ardently pro-abortion. Biden has repeatedly been accused of being a little too handsy with women. And now, there's the explosive new claim from Jill Biden's ex-husband that is marriage to Jill, ended after he found out she was having an affair with the then-Senator Joe Biden back in the early 1970s. Joining me now is Mercedes Schlapp, Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor. And Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor. Mercedes, they were really selling this tonight, you know, Faith, family, country. It was almost you wanted to hear Lee Greenwood playing in the -- in the background. But our people ... MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR: They can't. INGRAHAM: Our people actually going to buy this, given Joe Biden's positions on key issues or is it just being a nice person, and that's all that really matters? SCHLAPP: Well, I think they really are trying to sell this. You know, Joe is a good guy type of narrative. But let me tell you something, they might have forgotten that they took -- the Democrats took God out of their platform not too long ago. So, let's remember that when it comes to Joe Biden, he has been one that has flipped flopped on so many of these issues. He supported the Hyde Amendment at one point then abandoned the Hyde Amendment, which would allow for taxpayer funded abortions, and he's become extreme on that issue, especially on allowing for late-term abortions. And it's all because he's in the pockets of Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider. Let me tell you something as a Catholic, and as someone who's very strong pro-life, in my convictions, you know, you would need to stand for life. And that's something that I always admired President Trump, because he has been the most pro-life president that we have seen in our lifetime. He's taken very bold steps in ensuring that we protect the unborn. And I always said, and I remember I was there in the Oval Office when he signed that letter to Congress saying, look, we'll veto any legislation that would include pro-life provision. So, I think there is a stark contrast here and I think people have to remember that even Kamala Harris went after the Knights of Columbus and her anti-Catholic bigotry needs to be exposed. INGRAHAM: Raymond, here's how the DNC tried to paint Biden as a champion for women. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAUMESH AKBARI, D-TN: Joe Biden has been fighting for women his entire career. As Senator, he authored the Violence Against Women Act. And as President, he'll restore funding for Planned Parenthood. He will codify Roe V. Wade, and make reducing maternal mortality, especially for women of color a top priority. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Raymond, there's something quite amazing about talking about infant mortality in the same paragraph as support for Planned Parenthood. RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, Joe Biden has always tried to have it both ways here. In his memoir, he says, look, I'm as much a cultural Catholic as I am a theological one. So, you see, and he says, it's not the prayers, it's not the 10 commandments, it's the culture that I'm holding on to. This is why bishops have denied him communion. You can't, as a Catholic, go out, and continuously defy church teaching on something as basic as life. And this is a candidate who is going to -- he wants the Planned Parenthood fully funded. He wants to codify Roe V. Wade, as you're heard from that lady there. And look, the Little Sisters of the Poor, he claims he loves the nuns, except he's vowed to take the Little Sisters of the Poor to court to get them to pass contraceptives and abortifacients onto their employees. So, there's a -- there's a discontinuity here. It's not as personal piety. Nobody doubts that. And he may even be more personally pious than President Trump. But that's not why Americans vote for a candidate, you vote because they are following a moral code that you agree with, not that they personally hold something and then vote or legislate in an entirely different direction, and that's sort of what's happening here. INGRAHAM: Now, Mercedes, they didn't really talk for the second night in a row, much policy at all. I mean, it's just like hide the ball, hide the policy. So ... SCHLAPP: That's right. INGRAHAM: You keep Colin Powell out there. And I guess people are somehow reassured after Iraq. Oh, OK. You know, you put all the -- all these old homies out there, you know, the hometown team, and you think we're going to be reassured after Iran and Syria, and all the messes in the Middle East. So, they couldn't really talk policy foreign policy. Instead, they resorted to a string of bromides. Let's share them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know Joe Biden cares about the struggles, and that's why I trust him to fight for us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe will restore honesty, decency and trust to the White House. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has the heart and the compassion for this moment. YATES: We need a president who will restore the soul of America. We need Joe Biden. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Mercedes, it's, again, orange man bad. That's like all their posters on the protests. Right? SCHLAPP: Right. INGRAHAM: That's all they -- that's all it is. I mean, take away the trappings and the -- and the bad music and everything, that's it. And Joe Biden nice and orange man bad. That's it. SCHLAPP: That's right. I feel -- I feel like I'm kindergarten class. It's like, can we care and share and be kind? And what Pete -- what the American people are not seeing is the fact that their policies are detrimental to our country. In fact, they're dangerous, because we have the Biden record. I mean, the mere fact that they said that he can go into the Situation Room and make good decisions is just crazy, because it was in the Situation Room where he was wrong on Osama bin Laden. You know, he's made these decisions time and time again, where he was in favor of the Iranian nuclear deal which, of course, was supporting a country that supports terrorism. And so, it has been one bad policy decision after another. I always remember the red line in Syria, where they did an act, and then the Syrian civil war only got worse. So, this is what needs to be exposed. It's what Robert Gates said that, basically, Joe Biden cannot be trusted with any of our foreign policy. decisions. He's made bad decisions time and time again. And to bring out Secretary John Kerry to even try to have defend him, they obviously didn't tell the whole story to the American people. INGRAHAM: Raymond, just stylistically at the very end, the big -- the big reveal was for Joe Biden to walk into the classroom. Your take on that moment? ARROYO: Well, Laura, this felt like one of those Saturday morning infomercial blocks, you know, you were waiting for Sally Struthers to come out and say, won't you help these Democrats? I mean, you had Carter, you had McCain, you had Kerry, this was like a loser's convention, you know, please help them, please help them, in an inauspicious group to be with. But it's clear, this is an empathy play. They want you to think Joe Biden's a great guy. He's a nice guy. He's a man of faith. He's a family man. And now with Jill's ex-husband questioning when they might have met, the conditions of their meeting and possible affair, all of this is sort of thrown up in the air. So, I do think that's going to have to be scrutinize in the days ahead, as Donald Trump's relationships and questions about his personal life were scrutinized. I think you have to be fair here. But on the whole, this is an empathy play, and that's not policy, and I'm not sure that's what Americans are looking for right now, but we'll see. But he did say first lady -- first -- did he say lady, lady, lady, or that was an act going on? ARROYO: Lady, lady, lady and I'm Joe Biden's husband, I think is what I heard. SCHLAPP: Sounds like a song, lady, lady, lady. Lady in red. INGRAHAM: Exactly. Mercedes and Raymond, great to see you tonight. All right. We've gone through what the Democrats wanted you to hear tonight. But the big news is, what did they mention? Well, there wasn't a peep about the S&P 500 closing at a record high today, erasing all the losses from the COVID lockdowns. Unbelievable. Likewise, no one mentioned that the housing market is on fire. Housing starts jumped a whopping 22.6 percent last month, which was above expectations. And, of course, there wasn't a word about the skyrocketing number of murders in Democrat-controlled cities. Murders are up 29.1 percent in New York City over last year. Oh, Schumer didn't mention that during his standup. Chicago seen their homicides spiked 35 percent and murders shot up 11 percent in Milwaukee where they're supposed to have the big convention. And 17 percent in D.C. Joining me now is Tom Bevan, co-founder, president RealClearPolitics. Raheem Kassam, The National Pulse editor-in-chief and co-host of the War Room pandemic podcast. Tom, it seems like -- to me, it seems like a mistake for Democrats not to even acknowledge -- passing acknowledgement of the unprecedented crime wave that is overtaking cities combined with the ANTIFA and the BLM activists who've gotten mixed up and all of this rioting and anti-police stuff that's going on, but no mention at all. Is it a mistake? TOM BEVAN, PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: I think it might be. I mean, obviously they're not going to talk about the stock market or housing or anything, but the way that they have -- and they have --on the other side of it, they have really driven the social justice, the systemic racism angle and, you know, this push for equity and equality and all of that. But I do think they run a risk of, you know, voters tuning in especially not hardcore democrats but independence and moderates, and having this disconnect between what they're seeing on the television at night, during the Democratic Convention, what they've been seeing online and on their television during the day, the scenes from my very own Chicago, I mean, it's been a really, really awful bloody summer of, you know, violence and looting. We've seen what's going on in Portland in these other places. And so, without even acknowledging or even a passing word, to denounce violence or looting, I think they do actually run a risk, and that's obviously a message that President Trump and the Republicans are going to push very hard during their convention, the law and order. And so it will be a stark contrast. INGRAHAM: Raheem, we heard from Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, she did the big nomination of Bernie Sanders, and she has 60 seconds. But if you're a lobbyist in a Biden administration, who's going to have more influence you think AOC, or I don't know, John Kasich and Colin Powell? RAHEEM KASSAM, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE NATIONAL PULSE: Well, I mean, that really depends. And it really depends on who the lobbyists wants to grease that day, that's all have the most power in a Joe Biden administration. And I just -- I want to come back to something that I think has been mentioned across your show so far, but it just strikes me as when we look at trying to win this election, right? That's what we're trying to look for, the signs of whether or not the Democrats actually can win this election. You hear so much emotion today, lots and lots of path loss, some of it even genuine, but it didn't hear much log-offs, nothing much in terms of policy, nothing much in terms of substance. And certainly, you didn't see, Laura, ethos. I mean, you look at the rejects that were lined up there, whether it was Kasich yesterday or Colin Powell today, and Sally Yates, who was wait fired for opposing something that the President of the United States was elected to do, just very recently, after she decided that it was on her to stop it happening. And then, of course, Bill Clinton, I mean, what a good time to put Bill Clinton up on stage. So, for me, when you look at all of those three things, and you see that they're just purely focusing on the emotive side of things, that's a miss judgment. It's a dangerous misjudgment by the Democrat Party. They got to look at their consultants and the people running their campaigns again, I think, because they just don't get it. They don't understand that this country wants to see action right now. There were three words this country cares about and it's, action, action, action. And if the RNC is going to learn any lessons from what we've seen over the last few days, is to get away from this telethon style format and look to a more action-based format. INGRAHAM: Yes. Tom, I want to talk to you about that, given that the polls are tightening across most of the country right now. What can the Republicans learn, given what we've seen with just the mechanics of how this is going as a virtual convention? It's my understanding that the Trump campaign, at least, they haven't told us where exactly the President is going to be giving his address from at the White House, but where? Is it a portico? Is it inside? Is it on -- it seems like there's a lot of kind of maybe too much fluidity and what the Trump campaign has planned for next week? I'm a little concerned about that. But somehow, this stitching together zoom video type stuff gets really old really fast. BEVAN: It does, and look, it's tough and both parties are operating under extraordinary circumstances and the Democrats are actually technically pretty good at this stuff. They've got the backing of Hollywood and they can make these slick productions. And even with all their wizardry, it's still -- it comes off, you know, synthetic in force. But I just want to say one more thing and you've talked about this -- you talked about this in the last segment, Laura, one of the reasons that we're seeing the Democrats so heavy on the anti-Trump stuff is that's what's animating their base. I mean, you got two thirds to three quarters of Democrats say they're turning out to vote against Donald Trump instead of for Joe Biden. And so, that's the dynamic that they're playing on. And the question is, is that going to be enough? If there's no policy, no vision to go along with it? It didn't work for Democrats in 2004 when they tried to down George W. Bush. It didn't work for Republicans in 2012 when they tried to take out Barack Obama. Hating the opposition will get you only so far. And I think, unless we see that vision piece of it emerged in the next couple of days, I think Democrats are leaving an opportunity on the table for Donald Trump and the Republicans to step in and fill that vision void. INGRAHAM: Yes. I also think Jill Biden talking about how basically under Joe Biden administration kids would be laughing again and playing and in school, and I'm thinking every Democrat state, for the most part, have kids out of school. Right now, it's the Democrat states that have the -- have the most stringent rules and regulations in place. And in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, had some of the worst COVID losses. So, I'm not getting how you may even wave a magic wand and then Joe Biden is going to open the schools, that doesn't even pass the straight face test. They're the ones closing the schools. Gentlemen, great to see both of you tonight. And all the presenters at tonight's DNC did their best to ignore the violence and decay of all the chaos and all the American cities as we were just saying, and it doesn't take a detective to figure out why because, you know, it's a perfect time for the GOP to start taking advantage of this. My next guest is working to do just that. And she's gone viral for taking her message to the streets of Baltimore. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIMBERLY KLACIK, MARYLAND REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Do you care about black lives? The people that run Baltimore don't, I can prove it. Walk with me. They don't want you to see this. I'm Kim Klacik. This is Baltimore, the real Baltimore. This is the reality for black people every single day, crumbling infrastructure, abandoned homes, poverty and crime. Baltimore has been run by the Democrat Party for 53 years. What is the result of their decades of leadership? Baltimore is one of the top five most dangerous cities in America. The murder rate in Baltimore is 10 times the U.S. average. Go to any Baltimore neighborhood and ask this question. Do you want to defund the police? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely not. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had three sons killed in Baltimore City. And I think if we defund the police officers, it's going to be worser than that. So, no, I'm opposed to that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you going to defund the police for? Why? How do you defend your city, your community? Families are losing people. KLACIK: Democrats think black people are stupid. They think they can control us forever, that we won't demand better, and that will keep voting for them forever, despite what they've done to our families and our communities, are they right? INGRAHAM: Joining me now is a woman you just saw, Kimberly Klacik, congressional candidate for Maryland, seventh district. Kimberly, this now has over five million views on your Twitter page. But what's the response been from the people in Baltimore? KLACIK: So, thank you, first of all, for having me, Laura. You know, it was us sitting here just last summer talking about the blight when I took videos that kind of went viral because President Trump retweeted them. But here we are a year later talking about the same thing and the same problems. But I've been noticing a lot of people have been commenting and said, you know what, she's not lying about what's going on here. And I'm so thankful that so many people took notice, and they've been retweeting it. Even the president retweeted it today. And so now people are really thinking, hey, you know what, if we vote Republican, could things change? I really just want to get an office and show people that you can have a better quality of life. It is possible and especially if you vote Republican. INGRAHAM: It seems like a message of hope used to be what the Democrats stood for, going back to Bill Clinton in 1992, he was the man from hope, then it was Bill Clinton, hope and change. But over the last few days of the Democrat convention, there's been a lot of depressing, this very dark, fear-based messaging. I didn't see a lot of hope from either day, frankly. KLACIK: No, absolutely not. And I actually saw the speech that Michelle Obama gave and she talked about how, you know -- even she's a victim being black in America from her mansion in Martha's Vineyard. You know, it's always about victimization. But I know for a fact, you know, in Baltimore City, especially where I was in those videos, the pen works corridor, you know, billions of dollars of federal funds was sent to that area. And here it is in 2020, it still hasn't made it to the ground. And so from what I can see, the Democrat Party loves to leverage the urban struggles, and annually ask for more federal funds, but then they actually don't, you know, remedy the problems and say, you know, this is what we're going to do, no one follows up on it. And I think people just accept it at this point. And I think now, we're at a point where people are saying, you know, what, maybe I won't vote down ballot, maybe I'll take a look at other options. And I have to say, going through the city, I've been in West Baltimore for over a year now and just talked with people about what the issues are. And I asked him, I say, hey, you know what, why haven't you ever voted for a Republican or something different? And a lot of people will say, you know, you're the first Republican I've ever met. So as Republicans, I think, we have to stop writing off these cities that we think we can't win and really get in there and roll our sleeves up and let them know that there are options. INGRAHAM: Kimberly, you can't win if you don't show up. And in a very simple, commercial -- simply worded and beautifully shot and, of course, you look right in it as well, which always helps. KLACIK: Thank you. INGRAHAM: But it was just -- it was beautifully laid out -- I just have. I'm curious, who had the idea for the -- for the layout of the commercial? Just the stylistic look of it. KLACIK: Yes. So, you know, luckily, this is something that we've been working on for over a year. If you go to my YouTube channel, you'll see where we had many videos where we go out and interview people kind of like the man on the streets, interview style. And then I would show, you know, people just exactly how bad the blight is. You know, in West Baltimore alone, we have over 17,000 vacant homes. That's something that needs to change. You know, this is an area where there aren't any career opportunities. And for me as a member, hopefully of Congress in November, I want to bring career opportunities to the area. You know, Baltimore City has the second largest port in the country, we could utilize that. We saw with the COVID pandemic, we relied on other countries for PPE. You know, why not bring that billion-dollar medical equipment industry back to America and right back through the Baltimore port? INGRAHAM: Kimberly, have you heard from Larry Hogan? Governor Hogan? KLACIK: Not yet, but we're hoping that he will reach out and we've been trying to reach him too. So, you know, we ... INGRAHAM: The Republican governor of Maryland has not reached out to you after this video? KLACIK: Not yet. INGRAHAM: Has the RNC reached out to speak at the RNC next week? KLACIK: Absolutely -- they have not asked me to speak, but they did reach out and congratulate me on the video and said that they are there to help. So, we have heard from them. INGRAHAM: OK. Kimberly, you should be appearing at the RNC next week. And I hope they're watching because if they haven't figured this out yet, then I don't know what to say. Kimberly, best commercial I've seen and could be 10 years. Fantastic job and we wish you the best of luck. We'll check back with you. KLACIK: Thank you, Laura. Thank you. INGRAHAM: All right. And it was a year ago that we protest had Kimberly on. Now, it's abundantly clear the Democrats can't compete on policy. That's why they spend all night invoking their favorite Boogey Man. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to end systemic racial injustice. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY: Fight systemic racism in the criminal justice system and in our economy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And takes on racial and economic justice. ROSA COLQUITT, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF OREGON'S BLACK CAUCUS: As black American standing on native land, we proudly represent Oregon, the viruses COVID-19 and racism laid bare. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Niger Innis, Congress of Racial Equality chair. And Horace Cooper Project 21 co-chair and author of \"How Trump is Making Black America Great Again.\" Niger, how can Democrats tackle racial injustice when they willfully ignore the horrific levels of violence that is -- are destroying our cities right now, especially in minority neighborhoods? NIGER INNIS, CHAIRMAN, CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY: It's a -- it's a bloodbath, a black -- young black or brown man has a better chance of survival in the streets of Kabul, Afghanistan or Iraq, than they do the streets of Baltimore, Chicago, or my native New York, and it's an absolute disgrace. And the reason they run on these nice-sounding terms like systemic racism is it gives no culpability or responsibility for the conditions that most black people find themselves in, in these urban centers that have been controlled, not just by Democrats today, but for decades, for my -- for -- our lifetimes. It's a disgrace. So, if they have nothing to run on in terms of their record, they run against this really evil sounding word called systemic racism. INGRAHAM: Horace, Stacey Abrams made an appearance tonight and others spoke about, you know, the importance of having an empowered black woman in America today speaking and connecting with others. Is anything positive there did you find? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21: Well, she wasn't able to convince the people of Georgia that there was something positive that she was offering. But let me just say this quickly that systemic racism is a useful term when you don't want any way of there being an objective measure of whether you're making progress in solving the problem. The problem-solving class greatly benefits from poverty from education, and now when we bring so called systemic racism to the front, they get their Volvo's, their ski trips out to Aspen, all this for decades to come, and we the taxpayers are left with the bill. INGRAHAM: And Niger, the old lie was repeated tonight about the Postal Service and Trump doesn't want you to vote and, and they're going to try to suppress the vote. And again, it's the same thing we heard in 2016. I guess slightly updated with a fake post office story. INNIS: The fear that Democrats have and liberals have, and they should have it, is that President Trump, certainly before the COVID crisis, but even now, President Trump is doing better than most Republicans have in black and brown precincts. And they're afraid that if this president approaches anywhere between 13, 14, 15 percent of the black vote, 35, 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, there's nothing that the Democrats can do to win this election. And this President is fully capable of achieving that. And just pitching his economic message that he brought record recovery to these communities of color before COVID and they'll bring it back after COVID. INGRAHAM: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight, as always. And coming up, Stacey Abrams, I said. Well, she's spreading conspiracy theories about your right to vote. Georgia senator, Kelly Loeffler responds, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Of course, tonight's lineup of DNC speakers wouldn't be complete without the Democrats' poster child for voter suppression, Stacey Abrams. Now, she unsurprisingly used her time to falsely claim that your right to vote is being taken away by Donald Trump and the mean old GOP. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We do not elect saviors. We cast our ballots for those who see our struggles and pledge to serve, who hear our dreams and work to make them real. To defend our way of life by protecting our right to vote. In a time of voter suppression at home and authoritarians abroad, Joe Biden will be a champion for free and fair elections. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Here to respond is Georgia senator, Kelly Loeffler. Senator, why does Abrams keep getting a free pass to spread these types of conspiracy theories? SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER, R-GA: Well, look, Laura, everyone who wants to vote in this election who's eligible to vote is going to get to vote. It's really an excuse for why she lost the election in 2018. And she's creating a roadmap of excuses for Biden, when President Trump gets reelected in November. And he's going to get reelected because he knows how to create jobs that lift everyone in this economy up. He knows how to stand with our law enforcement, he strengthened our military, he helps Americans be safe and secure. And that's going to be completely evident when we get our chance to be on stage next week, and that's what Americans want. They want that certainty that security in their communities and in their jobs. And this is a -- this is a distraction to talk about voter suppression, to talk about the United States Postal Service. They are distracting from their lack of a platform that lifts all Americans up. INGRAHAM: And here's what she said last night on MSNBC, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABRAMS: What Brian Kemp did in plain sight was what they've been operationalizing for 20 years. He just decided to do it on steroids and in front of the cameras, that they're trying to force people into early voting or voting on Election Day, because they also have a plan for 50,000 people to serve as poll intimidators, to show up at those polling places, and do what works so well, which is scare people out of voting. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I mean, this is -- this is just the wackiest thing I've ever heard. I mean, I remember years ago was the new black panther party that was, you know, playing games at some of the polling stations as I recall, but suddenly there's a thousand magical people showing up to intimidate people. Again, she keeps getting away with this and people on television, just say how eloquent she is. LOEFFLER: Well, it's absolutely fact free. None of that's true. It's a -- it's a fiction that would explain why she lost other than the fact that Georgia elected Governor Kemp and rightly so, he's leading our state out of this pandemic, helping our state grow during a challenging time. What Georgians want to hear about, and I've been around the state talking to Georgians, they want to know, when can kids get back into school, when will their jobs be certain, how do we get the economy back on its feet. And they're seeing -- they're saying -- they're thanking me every day for supporting President Trump in this effort to get our economy rebuilt to get that blue-collar boom going. INGRAHAM: Yes, Senator, there's a lot of fearmongering, racial fearmongering, virus fearmongering, and now voting fearmongering. Thank you so much. Great to see you, Senator. And if you can believe it, the most cringe worthy moment of the night, of course, involve Joe Biden himself during his crowning moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Delaware is proud to cast its 32 votes for our favorite son and our next president. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our friend, Joe Biden. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And they kept playing the music over Joe Biden when he spoke for about four seconds. It's tough, virtually. That's all the time we have tonight.

Here\u2019s a sign that Americans still have a sense of humor despite a global pandemic, a nerve-wracking election season, civil unrest and an all-around dismal 2020. As Election Day\u00a0nears, lighthearted lawn signs appear to be sprouting up in yards across the country \u2014 and also for sale online \u2014 helping to give\u00a0spectators a bit of comic relief\u00a0as Americans prepare to hit the polls on Tuesday. Bipartisan sentiments include a\u00a0\u201cWu-Tang Forever\" sign, a sign that advocates for beer and cheese in 2020, and even a more optimistic \u201cLife is a gift\u201d sign, among some of the other\u00a0winners spotted on America's\u00a0lawns. And since a politically-charged lawn sign likely won\u2019t be enough to shift someone\u2019s political views anyway, here are some lighthearted selections from homeowners who are in on the joke. A tribute to the Staten Island-based\u00a0hip hop group, this homeowner's \"Wu-Tang Forever\" sign looks far beyond the 2020 election. Whether you're voting red or blue, there's nothing more American than a cold one \u2014 and if you're from Wisconsin, where this sign is, you'll have a special soft spot for cheese curds. Apparently, spectators may find themselves in the \"dog house\" if they don't vote \"blue,\"\u00a0according to this homeowner and (very likely) corgi parent. OMG Please Make it Stop sign 2020 fatigue is real. And this sign, currently for sale on Etsy, undoubtedly captures the sentiments of a good chunk of Americans. When you want a lawn sign so you can fit in with the neighbors, but you really don't care to take sides. Life will go on after Election Day, and when it does, here's a reminder to appreciate it a little bit more with this uplifting sentiment.",

            "article_content": "Kanye West weighs in on Planned Parenthood and how his mother refused to abort him as a baby at his first presidential rally in South Carolina. Rapper and presidential candidate Kanye West called out abortion in the Black community and blasted his critics for getting so \"concerned\" about him crying over potentially aborting\u00a0his first-born child. \"I cried at the thought of aborting my first born and everyone was so concerned about me... I\u2019m concerned for the world that feels you shouldn\u2019t cry about this subject,\" he tweeted on Friday. His comments came after a viral campaign stop in which he cried while discussing how he and his wife apparently considered abortion. The emotional display prompted speculation about his psychological health while his wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian West, posted a video discussing his struggle with bipolar disorder. KANYE WEST GETS EMOTIONAL ON PRO-LIFE CAUSE AT FREEWHEELING EVENT: 'NO MORE PLAN B. PLAN A' Mostly known for his career as an artist, West delved further into politics during the Trump administration. He initially supported Trump but later distanced himself from the president. This month, he\u00a0filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. While he submitted paperwork to appear on the ballots of multiple states, he tweeted that he could beat former Vice President Joe Biden \"off of write ins.\" In another tweet, the 43-year-old producer relayed criticism of Planned Parenthood after it attempted to distance itself from its eugenicist founder, Margaret Sanger. Fox News previously reported on a spate of Black anti-abortion leaders who blasted the nation's largest abortion provider after it removed Sanger's name from one of its clinics.\u00a0\u201cFor me, this was kind of like changing the name of Auschwitz,\u201d said Roland Warren, the CEO of Care Net. Planned Parenthood has vehmently denied claims it's engaging in genocide. BLACK PRO-LIFE LEADERS PAN PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S SANGER DISAVOWAL: 'LIKE CHANGING THE NAME OF AUSCHWITZ' As anti-abortion activists repeatedly have noted, Black babies have long been disproportionately aborted in comparison to their share of the population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed this trend last November when it released its most recent report, which covered abortion trends in 2016. Despite their lower population levels, non-Hispanic Black women accounted for the largest percentage of abortions (38 percent), while non-Hispanic white women accounted for 35 percent. And out of 1,000 live Black births, 390 Black children were aborted in 2016, according to the CDC. The abortion rights group Guttmacher Institute, which previously functioned as the research arm of Planned Parenthood, similarly reported that Black, non-Hispanic women saw the highest abortion rate (27.1 per 1,000 women aged 15-44) in 2014, compared to other racial groups. That was nearly three times the rate of white abortions (10 per 1,000 women aged 15-44). \"Over 22,500,000 black babies have been aborted over the past 50 years,\" West\u00a0tweeted on Friday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's unclear exactly how many abortions have occurred in the Black community\u00a0since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. In 2015, the Center for Urban Renewal submitted congressional testimony claiming that 19 million Black babies had been aborted in the intervening years. Abortion in the U.S. has lopped millions of potential years off Black life, according to a study from the Charlotte Lozier Institure, an anti-abortion think tank. The 2016 report found that induced abortion siphoned 25,431,750 years of potential life from Black people compared to 22,721,475 from Whites and 15,479,100 from Hispanics.",

President Trump\u00a0pushed\u00a0back at an undecided voter\u00a0who claimed he\u00a0\"took his foot off the gas\" on coronavirus mitigation, and at another questioner who said he \"downplayed\" the severity of the coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic. Paul Tubiana, a health researcher from Bethlehem in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, said during the ABC News\u00a0town hall event in\u00a0Philadelphia on Tuesday that he voted for the incumbent president in 2016 and was supportive of him until he noticed a change in the White House's response a few months ago. \"I'm conservative, pro-life, and diabetic,\" he told Trump, adding that he has had to dodge pedestrians\u00a0who refuse to wear facemasks or social distance, despite guidance\u00a0from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. \"I thought you were doing a good job with the pandemic response until about May 1 -- then you took your foot off the gas pedal. Why did\u00a0you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?\" he asked. Trump rejected the assertion, offering a mild response: \"We really didn't, Paul, we worked really hard on the pandemic,\" Trump said. \"It came off from China, they never should've let it happen.\" Trump recounted his administration's work toward producing ventilators and personal protective equipment, accusing President Obama of leaving \"the cupboards bare\" when he left office in 2017. \"If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals,\" he added. Trump went on to ask Trubiana if he was from New York City, and the man replied that he was born there, but has lived in his current community 80 miles west of there for nearly two decades. Trump said that when it came to Trubiana's hometown, he provided city and state residents with a hospital ship and helped the local authorities establish a\u00a0military field hospital in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, regretting aloud that they weren't used as heavily as they could have been. He then pulled a small device from his suit pocket and said it was a new groundbreaking test produced by Abbott Laboratories that had, in his words, literally just been released. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president described the small cardboard test in his hand as 'very simple and very accurate.\" Later in the forum, Ajani Powell, a student from Pittsburgh, asked Trump why he would \"downplay a pandemic that is known to\u00a0disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities?\u201d -- in an apparent reference to comments the commander-in-chief made to former Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Trump disagreed with the assertion, responding that he did not \"downplay\" the virus. \"I actually, in many ways, I 'up-played' it in terms of action,\" he said. He pointed to his ban on travel to and from China in early 2020 and added that he later enacted a similar restriction against Europe. \"[W]e would\u2019ve lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on...\u00a0So that was called action, not with the mouth but in actual fact...\" The president added that, in contrast, the top officeholder in the Democratic Party, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was inviting people to join other community members in San Francisco's Chinatown in late February -- weeks after the White House took its first mitigation steps. Turning to moderator George Stephanopoulos, Trump said the virus will eventually \"disappear.\" \"It is going to disappear, George, we're not going to have studios like this where there are all of this empty space.\" In response to the overall criticism that he is misleading the public on the severity of the virus, the president pointed to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill speaking from London rooftops amid German Nazi bombardments. \"[Churchill was saying] you're going to be safe, be calm don't panic,\" Trump recalled. \"I guess you could say that's not so honest -- but it's great leadership.\"",

Conway accused Big Tech of being anti-Trump with \"selective engagement\" by taking down Trump's posts, among other posts, including those by pro-life and pro-Second Amendment supporters, but leaving up calls to annihilate Israel by Ayatollah\u00a0Ali\u00a0Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. FACEBOOK REMOVES TRUMP POST OVER CORONAVIRUS MISINFORMATION RULES; TWITTER ALSO CLAMPS DOWN \"Why do we have the Big Tech overlords telling us what is and is not legitimate on health matters?\" Conway told \"America's Newsroom\" Thursday. \"Twitter, Facebook, many of the forums are already overly anti-Trump. I think what's happened is that the president has over 200 million followers on all of his social media platforms, he has used it in a way no other politician has used it,\" she said, \"and they don't like that.\" In addition to Facebook taking down Trump's post, Conway points to the political motivation behind the bans. \"I think what many of these tech companies are doing now to the president, to conservatives, the shadow banning, the censoring, the selective engagement, is election interference,\" she said. On Wednesday, Liz Bourgeois, a Facebook spokesperson, said Trump's video was removed because it \"includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation.\" TRUMP MOCKS 'FAKE REPORTER' JIM ACOSTA, SAYS CNN DOESN'T HAVE SOURCES ON CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE The move comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has faced increased scrutiny to crack down on misinformation since the 2016 election, with a long list of companies that\u00a0have\u00a0threatened to pull advertising on the platform.

It is a natural and inevitable response to the militarization of one side.\" D'Souza, whose new documentary film \"Trump Card\" is set to come out next month, claimed the escalation of division by the Democratic party has set off a chain reaction, which has caused cities to break down and inspired hardworking taxpayers to start new lives in more rural areas of the country. \"There's a great line from the movie Breaker Morant, 'When one side violates the rules of engagement you would expect the same type of conduct from the other,'\" he explained.\u00a0\"This has to be stopped, otherwise you're going to see things just deteriorate. Cities will become uninhabitable. The cities are the center of western civilization. You have commerce and you have culture. The Democrats are making it such that it's difficult to have either one. That means technology, commerce, and culture will decamp and move out of the city, which means they'll become like ghost towns.\" D'Souza also spoke about the difference between the Democratic party now, compared to 25 years ago, saying that they have launched an effort to rebrand themselves as far-left while\u00a0making life difficult for center-right\u00a0people of faith. \"No one would claim that the Republican party and Christianity are the same thing,\" D'Souza said. \"So, an attempt to make a direct equation goes too far. The Republican Party stands for political things and Christianity stands for not only\u00a0spiritual things but it also stands for things that go beyond life in this word. Christianity in a much larger canvass than let's say conservatism or the Republican Party.\" DINESH D'SOUZA: IF YOU THINK TRUMP IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST, YOU SHOULD TALK TO A REAL ONE \"Now, that being said, Christianity has actually become a bone of contention in the United States today,\" he continued. \"For example, there are powerful attacks on religious freedom and on the churches. You see this in the double standard that the left applies when they want to shut churches down, but they don't want to shut protests down. They're basically saying that churchgoers should be second-class citizens as compared to protesters. Or that one enjoys a higher form of protection than the other.\" He then touched upon the pro-life issue and said voting Democrat is directly at odds with the tenets of Catholicism and Christianity as a whole. \"Another critical issue -- especially for Catholics -- but also for Christianity generally, is the pro-life issue. On which, Catholic teaching doesn't really admit any room for doubt,\" D'Souza claimed. \"It's not that you have some Catholic churches that are pro-life and other Catholic churches that are pro-choice. The Catholic Church institutionally is pro-life and it's pro-life based on the basic principle that life is a gift from God.. The pro-life comes out of a core doctrine of the faith which is that God made us and God cares about us and that our rights that come from God are inalienable. We couldn't give them up even if we wanted to.\" When asked how the divisiveness today compares to the mood during the American Civil War, he expressed optimism about the U.S. finding a way to unite again. However, he said there'd be a cultural backlash first, beginning with a mass exodus from all major cities. \"The circumstances are very different from 150 years ago. In no way is civil conflict inevitable,\" D'Souza said.\u00a0\"There are many other solutions. There are different ways in which groups that are very different can coexist, but all these ways are going to be tested. The left is looking to create a coalition of minority victims that equals 51 percent so they can loot and oppress the other 49 percent. Our model is, one way or the other stop them from doing that...\u00a0We will be essentially undoing 200 years of development of Western civilization. And commerce and culture will have to go elsewhere.\" He drew a line in the sand between the GOP and Democrats, saying one seeks to create anarchy and chaos, while the other seeks a peaceful coexistence based on individualism, freedom and economic prosperity. \"If the Democrats want to try the approach that's called 'license the criminal gangs and start setting fires to businesses' that's their model,\" the Indian Immigrant to America said.\u00a0\"Our model is peace and prosperity and commerce and civility -- then let people choose if they want to live in burned-out Milwaukee or burned out Portland, or if they'd much rather live in a nice Republican suburb where it's really nice and there's good stuff to be found in stores.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This is why the Democrat party relies on force,\" he continued.\u00a0\"Ultimately, they can only win if they can force us to live their way. Now, I don't think we're going to. We are no more going to submit to them and change our ways then perhaps they are going to submit to us. This raises the deeper question of how do we find a way going forward... We don't want the America they want and they don't want the America we want. The real question is, how do we coexist with each other. That's the real question of the future.\" When asked if Joe Biden could overcome perceived mental health and fitness issues to remain his party's nominee, D'Souza said he believes Democrats wanted Biden at the top of the ticket, as a way to distract from their radicalized brand of fractured identity politics. \"I think that the Democratic plan is [to swap out] Biden after the election. They don't want Biden to keel over before the election,\" he added. \"The reason they picked him is they think they needed a white male to camouflage the racial radicalness of their party. It's not like some chaotic process produced these horrible candidates. They chose him.\" \"Biden's not a natural Antifa type, but he is desperately trying to accommodate these people of whom he has no understanding whatsoever. They're aliens to him.\" D'Souza's new film is set to be digitally released on Oct. 9.",

Sign up\u00a0here.**\u00a0On the roster:\u00a0Power Rankings: Iowa swings for the fences\u00a0-\u00a0White House: Trump never briefed on Russian bounties -\u00a0SupCo deals pro-lifers a blow -\u00a0Under pressure, Trump looks to son-in-law for help - He took the baitPOWER RANKINGS: IOWA SWINGS FOR THE FENCESAs with much in political language, the term \u201cswing state\u201d has been so tortured that it might confess to any definition at this point.Take for example the recent discussions about Arizona, Texas and Georgia, longtime Republican strongholds that are looking quite squishy these days. Republicans are getting clobbered in Arizona and both Georgia and Texas are looking quite competitive, at least for now.But these are not \u201cswing states\u201d \u2013 at least not yet. These are states that might depart from their electoral histories and vote Democratic, but that doesn\u2019t make them swingers.Consider some of the surprises of our last big electoral earthquake in 2008: Indiana, Virginia and North Carolina hadn\u2019t gone for a Democrat in at least a generation, but all went blue.Twelve years later and only one of them is politically competitive. Indiana\u2019s Democratic rumspringa was brief indeed, returning to the Republican fold four years later with a 9-point GOP win. Virginia, on the other hand, left the Republicans and didn\u2019t look back.North Carolina, however, has embraced its swing state status with vigor. Races up and down the ballot remain tight with lots of ticket splitting along the way. There\u2019s a reason both parties have chosen Charlotte for conventions within a span of just eight years.Swing states are not competitive states. There are lots of states, like Minnesota and New Hampshire, where races tend to be close but where one party has a consistent advantage.Swing states are ones that show consistent political volatility \u2013 states where the electorate is elastic enough to switch sides with some regularity. Florida and Ohio have been the best examples in recent history, but the list changes subtly over time as states like Colorado and Nevada migrate out and states like Wisconsin and North Carolina migrate in.Which is a big part of the reason why we are moving Iowa from \u201cLean Republican\u201d to \u201cToss-up\u201d in our electoral power rankings.Iowa\u00a0swung 12 points from 2012 to 2016, indicating a state with a significant number of persuadable voters. That\u2019s the same reason Ohio looks so competitive this time around despite going so big for Trump in 2016.It\u2019s not that Iowa became a Democratic state in the Obama years, or it became a Republican state in the time of Trump. Instead, Iowa continues to swing like an oiled fence gate.We don\u2019t have a ton of polling from Iowa, but some of the polling we do have is primo stuff from pollster\u00a0Ann Selzer\u00a0for the Des Moines Register. Her March survey found President Trump up by 10 points, while her poll this month found him leading by a single point.That\u2019s on track with what other surveys have found as well as the nationwide movement of independent voters away from the GOP over that same time period.The good news for Trump is that unlike some other battlegrounds, voters don\u2019t seem too thrilled with his challenger, former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden. Twelve percent of voters aren\u2019t sold on either candidate and Trump\u2019s overall approval numbers are down, but well within his normal range. The trend could certainly change.The good news for Biden is that voters are undecided about an incumbent who has been in charge for four years, so they are highly susceptible to an argument for needed change. Iowa is one of several states where Biden can win if he can remain a reasonable-sounding alternative in a chaotic time.The Iowa change brings our current tabulation to Democrats with 249 electoral votes in the lean/likely categories, Republicans with 180 votes similarly situated and 109 votes as toss-ups.That means Republicans would have to win at least 90 of the toss-up votes \u2013 83 percent \u2013 to claim victory. Democrats meanwhile need just 21 more votes \u2013 19 percent of the toss-ups \u2013 to go over the top. Put simply, Democrats could win just by flipping Florida while Republicans need to win in at least five of the seven toss-up states.THE RULEBOOK: YOU HEARD IT HERE\u201cIgnorance will be the dupe of cunning, and passion the slave of sophistry and declamation.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 58TIME OUT: SNAKES DON\u2019T NEED TO BE ON PLANES TO FLYNPR: \u201cFlying snakes like\u00a0Chrysopelea paradisi, the paradise tree snake, normally live in the trees of South and Southeast Asia. There, they cruise along tree branches and, sometimes, to get to the ground or another tree, they'll launch themselves into the air and glide down at an angle. They undulate their serpentine bodies as they glide through the air, and it turns out that these special movements are what let these limbless creatures make such remarkable flights. That's according to some new research in the journal\u00a0Nature Physics\u00a0that involved putting motion-capture tags on seven snakes and then filming them with high-speed cameras as the snakes flew across a giant four-story-high theater. How far they can go really depends on how high up they are when they jump, says\u00a0Jake Socha\u00a0at Virginia Tech, who has studied these snakes for almost a quarter-century. He recalls that one time he watched a snake start from about 30 feet up and then land nearly 70 feet away.\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDNATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGETrump:\u00a039.4 percentBiden:\u00a049.6 percentSize of lead:\u00a0Biden by 10.2 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0Biden\u00a0\u2193\u00a01 point; Trump\u00a0\u2193\u00a01.6 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: Trump 44% - Biden 52%; CNBC: Trump 38% - Biden 47%; NYT/Sienna: Trump 36% - Biden 50%; Fox News: Trump 38% - Biden 50%; Quinnipiac University: Trump 41% - Biden 49%.]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(180 electoral votes)Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(249 electoral votes)[Full rankings\u00a0here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\u00a041.4 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a055 percentNet Score:\u00a0-13.6 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2193\u00a00.8 points[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 41% approve - 57% disapprove; CNBC: 39% approve - 52% disapprove; NYT/Siena: 41% approve - 56% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 55% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 42% approve - 55% disapprove.]WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP NEVER BRIEFED ON RUSSIAN BOUNTIES\u00a0Fox News: \u201cThe White House on Monday insisted there is \u2018no consensus\u2019 that the intelligence that Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops is accurate, which is why, it said, the issue was never flagged to\u00a0President Trump\u00a0or Vice President [Mike]\u00a0Pence, despite reports to the contrary by outlets including The New York Times. The comments from the administration come after a Sunday night tweet from Trump insisting he had not been informed of the reports because the intelligence community \u2018did not find this info credible\u2019 and amid mounting pressure from Congress to get to the bottom of whether Trump knew of the alleged bounties, and if so, why there was no known retribution against Russia. \u2018POTUS was never briefed on this issue because there is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations,\u2019 a senior administration official told Fox News, indicating that the intelligence did not make it up the chain of command to the president because intelligence department heads did not agree on the credibility of the information or that it had been verified to the degree necessary to flag to Trump.\u201dSUPCO DEALS PRO-LIFERS A BLOWFox News: \u201cThe Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a Louisiana law requiring that individuals who perform abortions at clinics have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital is unconstitutional, as it places an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The court ruled 5-4 in the case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, with Chief Justice\u00a0John Roberts\u00a0once again casting a deciding vote by siding with the court's liberal justices. The opinion, written by Justice\u00a0Stephen Breyer, noted that the Louisiana law is \u2018almost word-for-word identical\u2019 to a Texas law the court ruled was unconstitutional in 2016's Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. A District Court had rejected the Louisiana law because of that precedent, but a court of appeals ruled otherwise. \u2018We have examined the extensive record carefully and conclude that it supports the District Court\u2019s findings of fact,\u2019 Breyer wrote. \u2018Those findings mirror those made in Whole Woman\u2019s Health in every relevant respect and require the same result. We consequently hold that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional.\u2019\u201dUNDER PRESSURE, TRUMP LOOKS TO SON-IN-LAW FOR HELPPolitico: \u201cDonald Trump knows he's losing. The president has privately come to that grim realization in recent days, multiple people close to him told [Politico], amid a mountain of bad polling and warnings from some of his staunchest allies that he's on course to be a one-term president. Trump has endured what aides describe as the worst stretch of his presidency, marred by widespread criticism over his response to the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide racial unrest. \u2026 Behind the scenes, Trump and his team are taking steps to correct course. In the week since his Tulsa rally, the president has grudgingly conceded that he\u2019s behind, according to three people who are familiar with his thinking. Trump, who vented for days about the event, is starting to take a more hands-on role in the campaign and has expressed openness to adding more people to the team. He has also held meetings recently focusing on his efforts in individual battleground states. Trump's son-in-law\u00a0Jared Kushner, who effectively oversees the campaign from the White House, is expected to play an even more active role.\u201dSunbelt corona woes complicate GOP strategy -\u00a0Politico: \u201cThe explosion of Covid-19 cases in Sun Belt states is becoming another albatross for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection hopes \u2014 and creating a new opening for Joe Biden and Democrats in November. Republican governors in Florida, Arizona and Texas followed Trump\u2019s lead by quickly reopening their states while taking a lax approach to social distancing and mask-wearing. Now each of them is seeing skyrocketing coronavirus caseloads and rising hospitalizations, and Republican leaders are in retreat. It\u2019s hard to overstate the gravity of the situation for Trump: Lose any one of the three states, and his reelection is all but doomed. Liberal outside groups and the Biden campaign have launched digital and TV ads in Florida, Arizona and Texas hitting Trump for allowing a second wave of coronavirus. The developments have buttressed Biden\u2019s main argument against Trump: that he\u2019s incapable of bringing stability or healing in a time of crisis. \u2026 Polls indicate Florida is Biden\u2019s best pick-up opportunity, followed by Arizona and then Texas, a bigger reach.\u201dTrump\u2019s \u2018white power\u2019 tweet brings more headaches -\u00a0NYT: \u201cPresident Trump on Sunday retweeted a video of one of his supporters yelling \u2018White power!,\u2019 once again using the vast reach of his social media platforms to inflame racial divisions in a nation roiled by weeks of protests about police brutality against black people and demands for social justice reforms. The edited racist video shows a white man riding in a golf cart bearing \u2018Trump 2020\u2019 and \u2018America First\u2019 signs during what appears to be an angry clash over the president and race between white residents of a Florida retirement community. Mr. Trump deleted the tweet more than three hours after posting it. \u2026 The president retweeted the video to his millions of followers just after 7:30 a.m., thanking \u2018the great people of The Villages,\u2019 the Florida retirement community where the clash apparently took place. He added: \u2018The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall. Corrupt Joe is shot. See you soon!!!\u2019\u201dThe story behind Arizona\u2019s evolution -\u00a0FiveThirtyEight: \u201cFor years, Arizona was to Democrats what\u00a0Lucy\u2019s football was to\u00a0Charlie Brown. \u2026In fact, no Democrat won a statewide election in Arizona on any level after 2008 until 2018, despite numerous close calls. But Arizona is changing. In the 2008 and 2012 presidential races, the state was 16 points and 13 points more Republican-leaning than the country as a whole, respectively. But in 2016, President Trump won Arizona by only 4 points, making the state just 6 points more Republican-leaning than the nation. And in 2018, four Democratic candidates broke through and won statewide, including Sen.\u00a0Kyrsten Sinema. Now, in 2020, Joe Biden looks like he has a chance to actually win Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes. As of June 29, Biden led Trump by 4.7 points in our Arizona polling average. And it looks like Democrats could flip another Senate seat here too, as Democrat\u00a0Mark Kelly\u00a0leads Republican Sen.\u00a0Martha McSally\u00a0by double digits in numerous polls.\u201dHUNTSMAN\u2019S COMEBACK BID LOOKS LIKE A TOSSUPSalt Lake Tribune: \u201cA new poll in the primary race for Utah governor has the two front-runners \u2014 Lt. Gov.\u00a0Spencer Cox\u00a0and former Gov.\u00a0Jon Huntsman\u00a0\u2014 in a virtual dead heat just days before the election. With 30% support, Cox was 1 one percentage point ahead of Huntsman in the Salt Lake Chamber survey conducted June 17 to 24 and released Thursday. That gap is within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 2.77 percentage points. The polling firm, Dan Jones & Associates, indicated the race is simply too close to call between the front-runners and \u2018turnout will be the deciding factor as it is in most every close election.\u2019 \u2026 Cox was ahead by a wider margin among the 492 respondents who said they\u2019d already cast their ballots, leading Huntsman by 35% to 30%, just outside the poll\u2019s margin of error. On the other hand, Huntsman appeared to have the upper hand among the 755 people who said they hadn\u2019t yet cast a ballot but would; these voters backed Huntsman over Cox by 29% to 27%, although that difference was inside the poll\u2019s margin of error.\u201dThe unusual race to take on party-switching N.J. congressman -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0 \u201c[Amy Kennedy] 41, grew up in this Jersey Shore outpost in a family that was politically active only at the municipal level. She spent 10 years as a public school teacher. Now, the mother of five is running in a key congressional battleground that has the backdrop of President Trump and a Democratic vendetta to take out a once trusted ally who betrayed them. And, in perhaps the most unusual fashion, she is running as an outsider, trying to establish a new beachhead for one of the most famous families in Democratic politics. The irony is not lost on Kennedy\u2019s main opponent, who has spent 20 years as a political commentator in New Jersey, a tenure that helped to quickly win the backing of six of the eight Democratic county chairmen in this district. \u2018The Kennedys as outsiders,\u2019\u00a0Brigid Callahan Harrison\u00a0said Wednesday, in an hour-long telephone interview, amazed at how much the race is pivoting on personality. \u2018That is how they\u2019re marketing this.\u2019\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYFederal Election Commissioner rendered toothless again by resignation\u00a0-\u00a0PoliticoPergram: How the Senate's police reform bill stalled in political purgatory\u00a0-\u00a0Fox NewsMontana GOP busted for funneling cash to Green Party effort\u00a0-\u00a0APPutin pulls out all the stops in power grab amid waning support\u00a0-\u00a0BloombergFrank Bruni: Duckworth is Biden\u2019s best option for veep\u00a0-\u00a0NYTAUDIBLE: JUST KIDDING\u2026 SORT OF\u201cBy all means, overshadow us.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0An unnamed Biden campaign aide\u00a0quoted by\u00a0the NYT responding to the concerns that former President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0would overshadow his former vice president by taking a more active role in the 2020 campaign.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cDue to an appalling lack of leadership we now find ourselves with the worst pandemic combination possible, high rates of infection and economic collapse. Multiple opinions exist as to which of our leaders contributed most to this. I understand these differences and can attribute them to ideological differences. I am however baffled by the controversy surrounding masks. The scientific consensus regarding mask wear is that they provide some protection to the wearer but that most protection is to those with whom the wearer comes in contact. In short, the mask protects your neighbors more than it protects you. Assuming that is the case it seems that mask wear is the easiest thing one can do to demonstrate one's regard for their fellow citizens. In short, not wearing a mask while in an indoor public space says, \u2018I don't care about you.\u2019 It is a malignant twist of Patrick Henry's quote, \u2018Give me liberty and give you death.\u2019 I understand the freedom and liberty argument. However, I have heard it stated that we have freedoms from and freedoms to. We have freedom to wear a mask or not. Conversely, we have freedom from preventable exposure to a potentially deadly pathogen. This is a low risk, high benefit intervention. It seems silly and selfish to choose this as a cause to argue individual liberty.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.[Ed. note: *retweet*]\u201cIs mandating face masks at the federal level constitutionally allowed?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jackson Sperry, Chaska, Minn.[Ed. note: I cannot imagine how it would be. Even given the recent trend of presidents attempting to rule by fiat, I can\u2019t imagine any order forcing all Americans to do so would pass constitutional muster. Former Vice President Biden did a little weasel wording in his answer where he talked about \u201ceverything I can,\u201d and I suspect that would not include a presidential diktat. As my dear mother would have called it, it sounds to me like bar talk.]\u201cI signed up for your daily report in the hope of reading a smattering of right-leaning material. What I read, however, seems slanted to a Joe Biden campaign ad. If that was your intention from the outset, consider me misinformed. I do not have to watch Hannity to know about Biden\u2019s corruption, his sexual harassment, his lack of accomplishments over a lifetime of political life, his obviously deteriorating mental state, and his inability to communicate from his basement without making a complete fool of himself. You did hear him tell the public that 120 million of our citizens have died from COVID. But reading your piece one might come away with the opinion that Biden is going to skate into the presidency. If your intention is to scare us from complacency, consider it done. I won\u2019t have to endure intruding CNN idiocy on my Facebook feeds any longer.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jeff Maidment, Ocean Isle Beach, N.C.[Ed. note: Mr. Maidment, if you came here looking for \u201cright-leaning material\u201d I am happy to disappoint you. But I\u2019m sorry you find us slanted in the other direction. Our goal is to give readers our best take on the state of politics as we can without tilting one way or another. And for those purposes, it doesn\u2019t matter who you or I think is better suited for the presidency or which candidates\u2019 defects we find most glaring. It sounds like you really despise Joe Biden, which is your business. There\u2019s plenty of folks who just hate, hate, hate President Trump. Like them, your vote is not up for grabs, which is fine, too. But we would encourage you to stick around and keep an eye on the state of the race from our perspective. We think you\u2019ll learn things and have some fun along the way as well. And that would make us the happiest of all.]\u201cChris has often mentioned his dislike of the primary system for choosing a party's candidate, arguing that \u2018smoke-filled rooms\u2019 are better suited to selecting a strong and effective candidate. Although I can see how the primary system arguably failed the Republicans in 2016 (at least in my view) and produced Donald Trump. But didn't the mainstream Democratic party choose Biden for 2020 and Hilary in 2016, and wouldn't it have chosen her in 2008 as well but for the primaries, and aren't these arguable weak, flawed choices?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Stacey Sovereign, North Beach, Md.[Ed. note: I think, Ms. Sovereign, that you will never find a system that does not produce some weak, flawed choices. Nor do I think that weakness or flawedness are static measures. Take\u00a0Hubert Humphrey. Under different circumstances he might have been a potent candidate, but with the administration he served a mess, the country in turmoil and segregationists in revolt, what chance did he have. I can\u2019t imagine any Democrat they could have picked who would have fared better than Humphrey. The same was true of\u00a0Barry Goldwater\u00a0four years earlier when\u00a0Lyndon Johnson\u00a0ran as the heir to a martyred\u00a0John Kennedy. The strength of Johnson and Richard Nixon was overinterpreted, as was the weakness of Goldwater and Humphrey. While we certainly care about a system that produces good leaders, our interest in the partisan selection process isn\u2019t an algebraic one in which we try to solve for a desired outcome. As some of our accidental presidents, like\u00a0Calvin Coolidge\u00a0and\u00a0Harry Truman, reveal, you never know where you\u2019ll find a great leader. What\u2019s wrong with the primary system isn\u2019t as much about the individuals it selects but what the process does to governance. Switching to a model that relies on state-run primary elections takes its toll up and down the ballot. The only way to get ahead in politics prior to 1980 was to pay your dues. There were always wunderkinds and rising stars and the occasional military leader but running for office meant getting inside the system and working your way up. That helped form candidates who learned the skills necessary for government. It took consensus building and compromise and the establishment of a good reputation to advance. By the time a candidate had made it to Congress or another high-level post, he or she would have been well-trained in the arts of persuasion and coalition building. Parties were a lot more like demi-governments. Now, that had its own problems in terms of high barriers to entry and unwillingness to change, to say nothing of cronyism and patronage. But I think that the primary system has introduced far worse ills by rewarding extremism, punishing consensus building and developing skills within election winners unsuitable to success in office.]\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a little behind in reading the Report, but I felt compelled to comment on your Wednesday edition where you said you were leaning towards supporting Madison\u2019s idea to base electoral votes on congressional districts.\u00a0 In theory this would not be bad, because it would more closely reflect the popular vote, but until we eliminate gerrymandering, I\u2019m not sure I want to go there.\u00a0 If we thought gerrymandering was bad now (when it only affects the House), imagine the extra effort that might go into drawing contorted districts when the Presidency might be at stake.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Steve Arthur, Woodland Park, Colo.[Ed. note: While I know many problems are laid at the feet of gerrymandering, Mr. Arthur, it is not a primary driver of the partisan composition of Congress. While the parties in each state certainly engineer districts to give themselves the maximal benefit, studies have made clear that using other, more neutral means would not produce huge shifts in partisan proportions in the House. Play around with FiveThirtyEight\u2019s atlas and see for yourself. The real objective of gerrymandering is to create districts that are easy for one party to maintain. That\u2019s one of the ways in which our primary system fails us. Because so few general election House contests are competitive and because the districts are arranged to concentrate members of one party or the other encourages extremism and punishes compromise. But as for how it would play in the Electoral College, I don\u2019t suspect gerrymandering would have that much to say about the final outcome. Though I should consider the role increasing the value of districts would play in encouraging even more gerrymandering. I will keep noodling!]\u201cI see the yearly \u2018D.C. statehood\u2019 cycle is upon us. Seriously? A 70 square mile city as a state? Why not just cede it back to Maryland and/or Virginia? I agree the representation issues need to be addressed. What are other considerations/options to solve the issue?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jack Whiteman,\u00a0St. Louis[Ed. note: Not only is your suggestion of retrocession a potentially good one, Mr. Whiteman, it has already been done. If you look at the District of Columbia on a map, it is about two-thirds of a diamond laid on a north-south axis, with the western border formed by the Potomac River. That\u2019s because in the mid 19th Century Congress decided that the federal government didn\u2019t need the land on the Virginia side of the river in the original plot for the city. What is now mostly Alexandria, Va. was retroceded to the commonwealth and ultimately accepted in 1847. Now look at the current map again and eye the long expanse of land the north of, say, the National Zoo. Why do those folks need to live in the federal district? The same goes for the land on the east side of the Anacostia River. Why doesn\u2019t the federal government enfranchise those voters for congressional elections by retroceding that land to Maryland. The answer is that it is not in the interests of anyone but the people. Maryland politicians have no interest in seeing Baltimore robbed of its power in the state by the arrival of what would be a huge, wealthy new city. And the leaders in the District of Columbia have no interest in seeing their clout watered down. Nor would Democrats like to give up on the chance to gain two new Senators while keeping D.C.\u2019s three electoral votes. It\u2019s a classic example of the divergence between those in power and their constituents, but not one I expect to be remedied anytime soon.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.HE TOOK THE BAITFox News: \u201cA Louisiana man seen in a viral video swimming inside an aquarium at a Bass Pro Shop store has been arrested, according to reports.\u00a0Kevin Wise, 26, of Slidell, was charged with simple criminal damage to property, a misdemeanor, the Bossier City Police Department said. The suspect went in the tank in Bossier City as part of a TikTok stunt, KSLA-TV of Shreveport reported. \u2018I said that if I got 2,000 likes I would jump in the tank,\u2019 Wise said, according to the station. \u2018I got way more than that and didn\u2019t want to be a liar.\u2019 The video, posted by\u00a0Treasure McGraw, allegedly showed Wise swimming in the store\u2019s fish tank, climbing out, and then fleeing the store, Shreveport\u2019s KTAL-TV reported. Wise was arrested after subsequently returning to the store, Bossier City police said. The store determined that it would incur costs for emptying and cleaning the 13,000-gallon tank following the alleged stunt, prompting the filing of a complaint with the police, KTAL-TV reported.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cEveryone now has his nail-clipper, tweezers or X-rayed-shoe story.

            "article_content": "Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew faces democratic challenger Amy Kennedy in hotly contested NJ House race. We have just a week to go until Election Day and the nation is obsessing over the presidential race. The speculation over which party will control the senate also continues to rage. I\u2019m guilty of it myself. Rarely a waking hour goes by where I don\u2019t think \u2013 and often say out loud \u2013 \u201cwhat am I going to do if Trump wins another term?\u201d The quick confirmation process for Judge Amy Coney Barrett this month has amplified concerns over the future of the senate. As a Democratic voter, I welcome recent changes in electoral forecasts that show Democrats winning back the Senate as well as having a good chance to take seats in historically Republican states like South Carolina. LESLIE MARSHALL: AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CONFIRMATION IS PROOF THAT WE NEED A BIDEN VICTORY IN 2020 What I do find missing in the punditry \u2013 and national conscience \u2013 is what\u2019s going on in House races across the country. There are a number of contests in swing and right-leaning districts that are not only poised to expand the Democratic majority but actually tell the true story of liberal politics today.According to the non-partisan Cook Political Report, Democrats are on track to expand their majority from five to 15 seats in the House. To do this, they are following the 2018 playbook: run centrist candidates in moderate districts with a focus on traditional issues like economic growth, innovation and education. A few campaigns, all backed by the New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, are worth mentioning. These candidates are in tight races and their messaging strikes through the heart of the rightwing narrative that Democrats are suffering from a party takeover by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\u00a0and other members of \u201cthe squad.\u201d Consider the race for Rep. Justin Amash\u2019s open seat in Michigan. Immigration attorney Hillary Scholten is vying to be the first Democrat to hold the seat in nearly 50 years. The district was won by Trump by 10 points in 2016 and Romney by seven in 2012. It\u2019s currently a toss-up. Why? An influx of younger voters makes it more amendable to a Democrat. But beyond that, Scholten is running a service-oriented campaign and relentlessly hammering the importance of giving Western Michiganders affordable health care and clean drinking water. She also regularly discusses her faith and though is a Planned Parenthood-endorsed candidate in a largely pro-life district, Scholten has been able to elegantly balance the importance of respecting a woman\u2019s right to choose and being a person of faith. It\u2019s a formula that moderate Democratic candidates have been winning on in recent years \u2013 and one Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden hopes to win the presidency on as well. In Pennsylvania, a state we all have our eyes on after the critical role it played in the 2016 race, Eugene DePasquale is running to unseat Republican Rep. Scott Perry in the 10th district. DePasquale is the state\u2019s current Auditor General and has won plaudits from both sides for his independence. His big issues? The practical stuff. Waste, fraud and abuse are all atop the list. He\u2019s also led the effort to crackdown on Pennsylvania's rape kit backlog, reducing the number of untested rape kits by more than 90%\u00a0and leading to justice for potentially thousands of survivors. Trump won Cumberland County by 22,000 votes and it\u2019s clear that DePasquale could help Biden make up some lost ground in Cumberland \u2013 and get himself across the finish line. Democrats have been focused on turning Arizona blue for quite some time and it looks like we are going to continue to make headway this cycle. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Dr. Hiral Tipirneni\u2019s campaign in Arizona\u2019s 6th district, which includes Maricopa county, is an important piece of the puzzle. Tipirneni spent more than 20 years as an emergency room physician and cancer research advocate. Unsurprisingly, her big focus has been on health care -- advocating for Medicare to be able to compete with private insurers. As an Indian immigrant who arrived here when she was only three years old, she makes a compelling case for the power of the American Dream and electing officials who believe immigrants make our country better. This race is rated a pure toss-up in a district the Republican incumbent won by 10 points in 2018. Last week President Trump told us that Republicans are going to take the House. Congressman Ami Bera, who chairs the NewDem Action Fund, told me something quite different. \"NewDems are shaping the\u00a0House battlefield through 31 challengers that have our support in extremely competitive races. They\u2019re focused on\u00a0the kitchen table issues that will help them win in these purple and red districts. If the president thinks he's going to\u00a0take back the House, he's going to have to come through us.\u201d It will be very difficult for the GOP to come through candidates that are running these centrist, bread and butter issues focused campaigns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the past few years, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing Democrat\u2019s focus on the issues that matter, not a lurch to the left. Democrats are in the majority in the House because we\u2019re a centrist party at our core. And that\u2019s why they are in a good position to expand their majority.

            "article_content": "'Unreported Truths' author Alex Berenson calls for global investigation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' This is a rush transcript from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\" October 26, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER\u00a0CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 The Senate voting as we speak to confirm\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. The count is\u00a0just wrapping up right now. We're hearing the roll.\u00a0\u00a0When she is sworn in this evening, and apparently she is going to be at\u00a09:00 p.m., the mother of seven will become the third Supreme Court Justice\u00a0appointed by this President, Donald Trump. No one expected that.\u00a0\u00a0For more on what this means for the court and for the country, we turn now\u00a0to Bret Baier. He is FOX News's chief political correspondent. He is the\u00a0anchor, of course, of \"Special Report\" on this channel every night.\u00a0\u00a0Bret, I mean, it's fair to say nobody expected this on many levels, but are\u00a0you surprised on a political level, that Republican Mitch McConnell was\u00a0able to hold all of these votes?\u00a0\u00a0BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 You know what,\u00a0Tucker,\u00a0I'm not, because of the superior delivery in the hearing of Judge Barrett.\u00a0She convinced the couple of wavering Republicans like Mitt Romney and Lisa\u00a0Murkowski that she was such a good jurist, such a good judge that she\u00a0deserved this this vote\u00a0tonight.\u00a0\u00a0It's historic. I mean, this is the third Supreme Court Justice for\u00a0President Trump. She is the youngest Supreme Court Justice as of\u00a0tonight,\u00a0and it is happening 38 days after the death of the liberal icon Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg.\u00a0\u00a0Democrats are apoplectic. Chuck Schumer said this is the darkest day in the\u00a0history of the U.S. Senate 231 years. And he pointed his finger at\u00a0Republicans on the other side of the well.\u00a0\u00a0Mitch McConnell said the reason we were able to do it in 2016, 2018, and\u00a02020, is because we won the Majority and we had the White House, and so he\u00a0made his point.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Man, I mean, it's a sweet moment for Republicans, but also maybe\u00a0a bitter moment for some Republican voters because it illustrates that the\u00a0Republican-led Senate can achieve things when it wants to.\u00a0\u00a0You think of all the policies that voters ratified in the 2016 election\u00a0that didn't make their way through the Senate, but when they want to do\u00a0something, they can do it with speed and certainty. So what will the\u00a0Democratic response to this would be, do you think?\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 This is their biggest.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It is. I agree with that.\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 This is the biggest win by far, not only the three Supreme Court\u00a0Justices, but the dozens and dozens of Federal Judges on different courts\u00a0that President Trump and Senator McConnell have steered into nomination and\u00a0confirmation.\u00a0\u00a0The Democrats' response to this was signaled by Senator Schumer, who said,\u00a0you have lost your credibility pointing to Republicans, and when we control\u00a0the majority, you have lost your ability to tell us how to run it, which is\u00a0sort of a foreshadowing to what has been talked about, and that is doing\u00a0away with the filibuster and possibly packing the court or doing some other\u00a0major systemic changes to the Judicial Branch.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes. And not just Judicial, bringing in Puerto Rico as a state,\u00a0and maybe other things as well.\u00a0\u00a0It's interesting, we didn't see the attacks on Judge Barrett that a lot of\u00a0us predicted. Why do you think that was?\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Because we were just days away from an election. And there wasn't -- there was a fear of a backlash from people who looked at Judge Barrett,\u00a0the mother of seven, a really accomplished jurist, and said, why are you\u00a0going after this person?\u00a0\u00a0I think that they looked at the electoral fallout of talking about her\u00a0religion, and they stayed away from it and really focused on Obamacare and\u00a0the case coming before the Supreme Court in just a matter of days.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Amazing. Just hearing that, the vote is still technically open,\u00a0but Republicans have secured 52 votes. So this is a fait accompli, what\u00a0happens next?\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Next, there will be a swearing in. That will be done by Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas, a ceremony at the White House. And obviously, we don't\u00a0have all of the details of that. The first ceremony of her nomination\u00a0caused quite a stir when all of those folks got sick after that Rose Garden\u00a0event.\u00a0\u00a0But I think there's a lot of protocols in place. It'll be\u00a0tonight\u00a0sometime,\u00a0and then there will be an official swearing in at the court, but she will\u00a0go to work right away.\u00a0\u00a0And just\u00a0tonight,\u00a0Tucker, the Supreme Court ruled five to three in favor of\u00a0G.O.P. blocking efforts to extend the absentee ballots in Wisconsin by six\u00a0days. So just\u00a0tonight, the Supreme Court is operating on election cases\u00a0that Justice Barrett will be a part of as of tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 I can't resist asking this, do you think it is possible that soon\u00a0to be Justice Barrett could weigh in on election related -- post-election\u00a0related cases.\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 I think it's clear from her hearing that she is not recusing\u00a0herself nor do legal experts think she has to, many of them. Some obviously\u00a0do and the Democrats say she should. But I think she will be a part of all\u00a0of these cases.\u00a0\u00a0And if it comes to states having challenges about their electors come\u00a0December if there is a Secretary of State that is one party and a state\u00a0legislature that's another party, and they are battling over who the\u00a0electors will be in an undecided election because of who didn't sign\u00a0absentee ballots, yes, she could very well be a part of a Supreme Court\u00a0deciding the next President.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It's all so amazing. Bret Baier, thank you for the guidance on\u00a0all of this. I really appreciate it. Good to see you.\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 You bet.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, ahead of the Senate confirmation vote\u00a0tonight, Democrats,\u00a0as Bret Baier just told you were absolutely apoplectic, the darkest day in\u00a0the history of the Senate; Chuck Schumer said from New York. They\u00a0threatened there will be consequences to what you just saw. The Democratic\u00a0senator from Connecticut Richard Blumenthal said this.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):\u00a0 Our Republican colleagues are shattering\u00a0the norms and breaking the rules and breaking their word, and there will be\u00a0consequences. There inevitably are consequences when one person breaks her\u00a0or his word.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Her or his word? Well, that's Amy Coney Barrett, of course he is\u00a0talking about and the idea is that she would somehow undo Obamacare,\u00a0entirely invalidate it. There's no indication in her previous decisions\u00a0that she would do something like that. But that has been a consistent\u00a0talking point among Democrats for the past several weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Listen to Cory Booker, who by the way, voted himself to undo, to abolish\u00a0Obamacare. Listen to Cory Booker warn you that Amy Coney Barrett will do\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): A future without the ACA looks like being forced\u00a0to sell your house if you can't afford your healthcare. It looks like not\u00a0having access to a doctor when you're sick. It looks like having to choose\u00a0between paying for groceries and paying for medicine.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Unfortunately, now that Amy Coney Barrett is on the Supreme\u00a0Court, you're going to lose your house, you're going to starve and you're\u00a0probably going to dive in an infection next time you stub your toe. So get\u00a0psyched for that.\u00a0\u00a0Charlie Hurt is excited. He is the opinion editor at \"The Washington\u00a0Times.\" He joins us\u00a0tonight. So Charlie, they are taking your house away?\u00a0\u00a0CHARLIE HURT, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Yes, no kidding. And, you\u00a0know, it's the darkest day in the United States history. That's quite\u00a0something else.\u00a0\u00a0You know, it's easy to look at this and see this as a tremendous victory,\u00a0and it is a huge victory for conservatives and for President Trump and for\u00a0Republicans. But I have to say, it's also a shocking moment in that it\u00a0reveals just how broken the system is.\u00a0\u00a0There are going to be nearly 50 senators voting against this woman. There\u00a0are going to be at least 48 senators who are going to vote against this\u00a0eminently qualified woman to sit on the Supreme Court based on basically\u00a0her family story, based on the fact, based on a religion, based on all of\u00a0these crazy things that we've heard from the left ever since she was\u00a0nominated, and throughout the entire process.\u00a0\u00a0We listened to Democrats sitting on the Senate Judiciary Committee, people\u00a0like Cory Booker, talking about how the process was a sham and it was a\u00a0charade and a circus. No, it's not a sham. It's called the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0HURT:\u00a0 But that's what these people think of the Constitution today. And\u00a0that's what they did -- and the reason that people like Cory Booker --\u00a0that's a great clip, you showed -- the reason that Cory Booker is talking\u00a0like that on that clip, is because they don't believe the courts are the\u00a0courts anymore. They don't believe the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0They believe that it's a super legislature. It's where all of the details\u00a0of Obamacare are supposed to be worked out and extended by an unelected\u00a0branch of government that serves for life and is answerable to no one.\u00a0That's what they believe.\u00a0\u00a0Half of the United States Senate, half of our Congress today believes that\u00a0and the way that Donald Trump has broken them, has broken through with the\u00a0biggest development in this entire judicial fight since the Supreme Court\u00a0first invented abortion rights as a constitutional right in the\u00a0Constitution, which of course, doesn't exist except in the numbers,\u00a0whatever the hell that is.\u00a0\u00a0The reason that he did this is -- the reason that Donald Trump is the only\u00a0one who have done it is that he made the argument that you know what -- the\u00a0Constitution means what it means. It means what it says and American voters\u00a0overwhelmingly understand that and believe that.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, nearly 50 senators in the United States Senate, don't even\u00a0understand that.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You've heard Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts today suggest the\u00a0Constitution itself was racist and sexist and homophobic.\u00a0\u00a0HURT:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Charlie Hurt. Thanks so much.\u00a0\u00a0We should tell you by the way, the vote is now officially completed. It is\u00a0closed 52 votes in favor of Amy Coney Barrett ascending to the High Court,\u00a048 against.\u00a0\u00a0Now it is onto that special swearing in at the White House that's slated to\u00a0begin as this show wraps up at 9:00 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0Joe Biden has refused to rule out responding to all of this by packing the\u00a0Supreme Court if elected President. In a recent interview, he said he would\u00a0form a, quote, \"National Commission\" to investigate that topic.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 If elected, what I will do\u00a0is I'll put together a National Commission -- a bipartisan commission of\u00a0scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal and\u00a0conservatives, and I will ask them to over 180 days come back to me with\u00a0recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it's getting\u00a0out of whack in the way which it has been handled.\u00a0\u00a0And it's not about court packing, there's a number of other things that our\u00a0constitutional scholars have debated, and I've looked to see what\u00a0recommendations that Commission might make.\u00a0\u00a0QUESTION:\u00a0 So you're telling us you're going to study this issue about\u00a0whether to pack the court.\u00a0\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 No, whether there's a number of alternatives that are well beyond\u00a0packing.\u00a0\u00a0QUESTION:\u00a0 This is a live ball.\u00a0\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 Oh, it is a live ball.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It is a bipartisan commission. So it's Sandy Cortez and Bill\u00a0Kristol who are going to look at it from both sides. Where is this all\u00a0going?\u00a0\u00a0Jenna Ellis is a constitutional attorney. She is a campaign adviser, a\u00a0senior adviser to the Trump re-elect, and she joins us\u00a0tonight. Jenna,\u00a0thanks so much for coming on.\u00a0\u00a0JENNA ELLIS, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR LEGAL ADVISER:\u00a0 Great to see you,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So, give us your most sober analysis of where you think this is\u00a0really going?\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS:\u00a0 Well, of course, Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrats simply\u00a0want to change the rules, and they don't care about the Constitution. They\u00a0don't care about our system of government.\u00a0\u00a0They would prefer to keep the Judicial Branch as a super legislature and as\u00a0an activist majority, and that's what we've seen through the past 50 and 60\u00a0years.\u00a0\u00a0What Joe Biden is expressly ignoring is what Alexander Hamilton said so\u00a0perfectly in Federalist 76, through 78, which is that the Judicial Branch\u00a0is designed to be the weakest branch, only to be able to review the policy\u00a0and law making decisions of the two political branches. It's not supposed\u00a0to act with partisan interest.\u00a0\u00a0And Hamilton even acknowledges in the Federalist Papers that the reason\u00a0that the nomination is vested in the President pursuant to the Constitution\u00a0is because he would expressly not have the special interest in lawmaking\u00a0contemplations that the House or the Senate would.\u00a0\u00a0And so Joe Biden is forgetting all of that. He doesn't want to acknowledge\u00a0that. He doesn't want our system of government to operate how it is\u00a0designed. He wants to completely throw it out because the design and\u00a0functionality of our Constitution, of our limited powers given to\u00a0government is a stopgap and it's actually preventing the Democrats from\u00a0putting through their activist partisan policy agenda.\u00a0\u00a0If they are so worried about Amy Coney Barrett acknowledging that the ACA\u00a0is unconstitutional, then maybe they should be very careful to actually put\u00a0forward laws that are constitutional instead of being so concerned about\u00a0someone who actually wants to be a judge.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, or just improve it in the Congress as the system intends.\u00a0All of this poison, all of these \"Let's tear down the system and create one\u00a0party control of the country,\" all of these ideas come out of the\u00a0universities, the ones that are getting billions in Federal subsidies every\u00a0year. Why are we paying for this crap?\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS:\u00a0 We shouldn't be. And that's what President Trump has even said\u00a0about making sure that we take away CRT programming and all of these other\u00a0things to universities that are teaching our children to hate America\u00a0instead of love its design and love the freedoms and liberties that we\u00a0cherish. And that's going to be his lasting legacy.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, and we're a week away from the election. I wish someone had\u00a0thought about this earlier because it really is, in my view, a grave -- a\u00a0grave threat. Jenna Ellis, great to see\u00a0tonight. Thank you so much.\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS:\u00a0 Great to see you, too,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So as we told you, it is done. The vote is over, 52 to 48.\u00a0Republicans prevailed\u00a0tonight. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana was one of\u00a0them. He just voted for Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation and we're happy to\u00a0have him on the show right after.\u00a0\u00a0Senator thanks so much for coming on\u00a0tonight. Why did you vote in favor of\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett?\u00a0\u00a0SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA):\u00a0 Because this is a victory for our founders. It\u00a0was never,\u00a0Tucker, about her qualifications. You would have to be barking\u00a0mad to think that she is not qualified in terms of intellect, in terms of\u00a0temperament, in terms of integrity.\u00a0\u00a0This fight was about who is going to make social policy in the United\u00a0States -- the Congress or the unelected Federal Judiciary? And we talked\u00a0about that at the conceptual level so much.\u00a0\u00a0Let me give you a specific example. Many transgender women want to\u00a0participate in female athletics. A transgender woman, as you know,\u00a0Tucker,\u00a0is a person who is born a male with the male characteristics, testosterone,\u00a0for example, who identifies as a female.\u00a0\u00a0And now many of those transgender women would like to participate in\u00a0women's athletics. If they are allowed to do that because of their elevated\u00a0testosterone, they are going to win every contest every time.\u00a0\u00a0Who do you think our founders intended to make a decision about that? The\u00a0people through their elected representatives in Congress.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0KENNEDY:\u00a0 Or nine unelected members of a Supreme Court appointed for life.\u00a0It's called judicial restraint, and Judge Barrett understands that, our\u00a0founders intended it, and that's why this was a victory\u00a0tonight\u00a0for our\u00a0founders.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 What a great example that is. The Congress can weigh in on all\u00a0this stuff. That is their job. And you wish they wouldn't boot it up the\u00a0Supreme Court because it corrodes the system, as you just so eloquently\u00a0explained. Senator, thank you so much.\u00a0\u00a0KENNEDY:\u00a0 Thank you,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Great to see you.\u00a0\u00a0Well, if there was a high point in these confirmation hearings, it is a\u00a0subjective call, of course, but from our point of view, it came from Mazie\u00a0Hirono, unquestionably, the shining intellectual star of the United States\u00a0Senate.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to choose your most trenchant observation in the past month\u00a0indeed of her career. But if you had to pick just one, it would be this\u00a0moment. It was so profound, that it literally changed our dictionary.\u00a0Watch.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI):\u00a0 Not once, but twice, you used the term sexual\u00a0preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community, and let me make clear,\u00a0sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term.\u00a0\u00a0It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a\u00a0choice. It is not. Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Sexual preference is not a choice. It's not a preference. It's\u00a0just like Mazie Hirono's intellect. She didn't choose to be that brilliant,\u00a0and in some ways, it's a burden, but she was born that way.\u00a0\u00a0Tammy Bruce is the host of \"Get Tammy Bruce\" on FOX Nation. She is the\u00a0person we call, with your particularly naughty intellectual problem, a\u00a0Gordian knot tied by Mazie Hirono. What does this mean? Will you explain\u00a0this to us, please?\u00a0\u00a0TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 So I will never forgive you.\u00a0This is so difficult.\u00a0\u00a0The fact of the matter is, Senator Hirono is wrong. Her remarks actually\u00a0come from a blue check guy on Twitter who decided it was offensive. The\u00a0fact of the matter is, what's ridiculous is that this argument, the word\u00a0police are coming from the side of politics that say that there are dozens\u00a0of genders and that whatever you say you are, you are.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, and this is the irony, it is the gay community especially and\u00a0liberals who should not be embracing this idea that someone else controls\u00a0the nature of who you are, how you identify, and the words you're supposed\u00a0to use it.\u00a0\u00a0And as a newsflash, for me as a gay woman, it is a sexual preference. No\u00a0one out there, not some young man with his blue check, no senator is going\u00a0to tell me how I'm going to identify. It is the height of bigotry because\u00a0it goes into this idea,\u00a0Tucker, that we're all the same, that maybe we all\u00a0look the same, and you can't tell us apart, and that we think the same and\u00a0that we vote the same.\u00a0\u00a0You know, we hear this through the Democratic Party now from Joe Biden\u00a0about black Americans. Now, all the gays are exactly the same, and there\u00a0are a lot of gay people watching now who are liberal, who are realizing,\u00a0\"I'm different from them.\" Right?\u00a0\u00a0We think differently. We have different ideas.\u00a0\u00a0So this speaks to the nature of liberalism, and let me say, Amy Coney\u00a0Barrett, a perfect example of what this country needs, that the\u00a0Constitution and the strength of that Constitution keeps minorities in this\u00a0country safe. That's how important she is.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 How nicely put was that? That's right. We're human beings. We're\u00a0not members of groups. We are not categories.\u00a0\u00a0And by the way, Senator Hirono, you're allowed to be attracted with anyone\u00a0you want. So why don't you back off. I wish someone would -- well, you just\u00a0said that much more eloquently than I did. Tammy Bruce, great to see you.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0BRUCE:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, throughout the hearings that we saw in the past couple of\u00a0weeks, Democrats treated Amy Coney Barrett's pro-life beliefs like they\u00a0were some kind of disorder, some kind of grotesque, malformity that she has\u00a0in her soul.\u00a0\u00a0Dianne Feinstein was caught on a hot mic muttering about it. Not everyone\u00a0agrees though and in cities like New York, more African-American babies are\u00a0aborted than are born and some people don't think that's a good thing.\u00a0Planned Parenthood is entirely in favor of it. They were started in order\u00a0to do that, to limit the black population in this country.\u00a0\u00a0But some are awake enough to be offended by that, and Kanye West is one of\u00a0them. He is running for President and he made that point recently. Listen\u00a0to this.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0KANYE WEST, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 With abortion culture, there are 1,000\u00a0black children aborted a day -- daily. We are in genocide. We -- so more\u00a0black children have died since February than people have died of COVID, and\u00a0everyone wears a mask.\u00a0\u00a0So it's a matter of where are we turning a blind's eye to?\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You've got to love how the crazy people are the only ones who see\u00a0things clearly. A reflection of our moment.\u00a0\u00a0Candace Owens is the author of the book \"Blackout: How Black America is\u00a0making its Second Escape from the Democratic Plantation.\" She joins us\u00a0tonight. That's -- the clarity of that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not promoting anybody's presidential campaign here, but I mean, just\u00a0the clarity of that observation is so overwhelming. You wonder how anyone\u00a0could hear that and disagree with it because it's just so true.\u00a0\u00a0CANDACE OWENS, AUTHOR, \"BLACKOUT\"\"\u00a0 It overwhelms me because I feel as\u00a0though many of us have been fighting for these conversations to be had for\u00a0a very long time. When I say many of us, I mean black conservatives and\u00a0what he is really getting at is selective outrage culture.\u00a0\u00a0You and I know who Margaret Sanger was. It's not taught in schools, but\u00a0we're supposed to be outraged because Amy Coney Barrett believes in life\u00a0and we're not supposed to be outraged that a eugenicist founded Planned\u00a0Parenthood with black American being targets, right, we are her targets.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Exactly. Exactly.\u00a0\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 She wrote extensively about how she believes in the extermination\u00a0of certain races, people that she thought were not fit to be in this\u00a0society, that she did not want the government take care of and black\u00a0Americans were among them -- and most people don't know this stuff.\u00a0\u00a0And here we have Kanye West who is speaking out and saying, \"You know what,\u00a0this is wrong.\" So while the left is dressing up and playing Halloween,\u00a0pretending that we live in some dystopian reality because Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0is talking about pro-life, black Americans are living a dystopian reality,\u00a0thanks to Democratic policies, which have results in half the black\u00a0population.\u00a0\u00a0Think about that,\u00a0Tucker. The black American population would be double\u00a0today if it were not for abortion.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 And that is -- and I am sorry to laugh as you were speaking. What\u00a0you were saying was so sad. But I just -- when you hear someone say it that\u00a0clearly, it just -- it makes you laugh at the absurdity of the\u00a0conversations that dominate our politics that are so far from the reality\u00a0of it. I mean, no one ever talks as plainly as you just did.\u00a0\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 Yes. And it's true, and it's been such a suffering because the\u00a0education system,\u00a0Tucker, is being wiped. We are replacing hard academics\u00a0with psychological conditioning.\u00a0\u00a0Black Americans are learning about Black Lives Matter and how depressing it\u00a0is and we should be blaming white Americans for everything. But we're not\u00a0learning about our real history. How we have been conditioned to allow\u00a0Planned Parenthood clinics into all of our neighborhoods, over 63 percent\u00a0of them are in black and Hispanic neighborhoods.\u00a0\u00a0This is systematic targeting. If you're looking for systemic racism, you\u00a0may want to take a look at Democratic policies. You may want to take a look\u00a0at why we as a society are saying there's something wrong with a woman who\u00a0believes in life, who believes that you know what, more black children\u00a0should be born alive. We shouldn't have 400 out of 1,000 black babies\u00a0aborted compared to white Americans where it's 103 out of 1,000 births.\u00a0\u00a0So this is this is really important stuff, and you're right, it is laugh --\u00a0it's laughable that, you know, we've come to this circumstance where people\u00a0want us to be outraged about other things and not this.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Exactly. I was about to say, why is it left to you and Kanye\u00a0West, of all people, to say this, but I really think that when people hear\u00a0what you just said, the overwhelming majority, no matter who they vote for,\u00a0have to acknowledge it's true. What you said is true, and I think the more\u00a0you say it out loud, the more that conversation changes toward a real\u00a0conversation, and I appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Candace Owens, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, Democrats are still pretending that Amy Coney Barrett's\u00a0confirmation is illegitimate. What does that mean, exactly? If it's really\u00a0illegitimate, then that's a crisis. So what are they saying?\u00a0\u00a0Well, their argument appears to be that we all need to honor Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg's dying wish, which is really our new Constitution. If Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg said something in the way out, that's basically our Bill of Rights\u00a0now.\u00a0\u00a0Elizabeth Warren explained that on the Senate floor just yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 It has also\u00a0been 37 days since Mitch McConnell declared he would disregard Ruth's most\u00a0fervent wish and move ahead with a corrupt and illegitimate process to fill\u00a0her seat on the Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0Let's be very clear, if Trump and the Republicans succeed in ramming this\u00a0nomination through, the American people will expect us to use every tool we\u00a0have to undo the damage and restore the courts' integrity.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Okay, so what she just told you was following the letter of the\u00a0Constitution and it's prescribed that as a Supreme Court Justice passes\u00a0away, how do you replace that justice? We just saw what the Constitution\u00a0tells us to do. That's illegitimate.\u00a0\u00a0What's legitimate is following the supposedly final words of a departed\u00a0Supreme Court Justice. No, that's a religion, what you're describing.\u00a0That's a religion. Scary.\u00a0\u00a0Ian Prior is Senior Counsel at the Article III Project and a former\u00a0spokesman for the Department of Justice. We're happy to have him on\u00a0tonight. Ian, thanks so much for coming.\u00a0\u00a0So when you were at D.O.J., when you first started, they brief you and tell\u00a0you that all law in this country emanates from the dying wishes of left-wing Supreme Court Justices.\u00a0\u00a0IAN PRIOR, SENIOR COUNSEL, ARTICLE III PROJECT:\u00a0 That was a manual that we\u00a0had to read our first day, and it was all the dying wishes that we've seen\u00a0in the Republic over the past 250 years and we had to make sure that, you\u00a0know, when we responded to press inquiries, we were cognizant of that law.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It's just so absurd, and you keep hearing people repeat it. I\u00a0mean, like trained seal, \"Well, it was her dying wish ...\" How do we get to\u00a0a place like this? It's so stupid.\u00a0\u00a0PRIOR:\u00a0 It's stupid, but it's also dangerous because it is delegitimizing\u00a0the Constitution. And you talk -- you know, you talk about the tools --\u00a0Elizabeth Warren's tools -- well, what are they right? Let's start off with\u00a0the Democrats wanting to get rid of the legislative filibuster. So that\u00a0means 51 votes will get everything passed.\u00a0\u00a0What they're going to do from there is then expand the Supreme Court to\u00a0have a liberal majority, and then these two other factors people don't talk\u00a0about as much, but D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood. That's four more\u00a0Democratic senators, a handful of members of the House and then they want\u00a0to lower the voting age to 16.\u00a0\u00a0You are potentially looking at a perpetual Democratic majority in the\u00a0Legislative Branch, in the Judiciary Branch and the United States of\u00a0America becoming the Orwellian States of America.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, everything you just mentioned comes out of the university,\u00a0too. Those are all ideas that incubated at Yale Law School and Harvard Law\u00a0School. The places that the rest of us are sending our tax dollars every\u00a0year. It is time to rethink that.\u00a0\u00a0If you want structural change, that's one of them. Ian, thanks so much for\u00a0coming on\u00a0tonight. Appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Before we get our next guest, our producer just said in my ear, our\u00a0producers watch the other channels during the show that MSNBC -- I'm just\u00a0going to go on faith in this because I didn't see it, but our producer said\u00a0MSNBC did not acknowledge Amy Coney Barrett's elevation to the Supreme\u00a0Court. It just happened moments ago, 24 minutes ago, and they ignored it\u00a0completely, which tells you a lot.\u00a0\u00a0So what does this all mean? Amy Coney Barrett is going to serve in the\u00a0Supreme Court of the United States. For the broader view, we go as we\u00a0always want to, to Victor Davis Hanson. He is a Fellow at the Hoover\u00a0Institution. We're happy to have him on\u00a0tonight. Professor, thanks for\u00a0coming on. How do you assess this?\u00a0\u00a0VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION:\u00a0 Thank you. Well, I\u00a0didn't know whether to laugh or cry when Richard Blumenthal, the Yale Law\u00a0graduate says there's consequences to not telling the truth, or the Harvard\u00a0Law Professor, Elizabeth Warren creates a new rule about dying justice. I\u00a0mean, it told you what the Ivy League has become.\u00a0\u00a0But past, present, future very quickly,\u00a0Tucker, Harry Reid was hubristic in\u00a02013 when he thought he was going to ram through these appointments without\u00a0the judicial filibuster all the way through the end of Hillary's second\u00a0term in 2024 and a nemesis hit him. They had three chances to take the\u00a0Senate: '14, '16 and '18. They couldn't do it.\u00a0\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg had all sorts of opportunities in her early 80s with\u00a0her poor health to step down and give that appointment to Obama. So a lot\u00a0of it is just teeth gnashing that's their own problem.\u00a0\u00a0But the President -- I think it helps Donald Trump in the next eight days\u00a0because it reminds that problematic independent woman suburban voter that\u00a0you can do things like Justice Barrett, you can have children. You can be\u00a0religious. You can have a job and you can do it with grace and you can be\u00a0conservative.\u00a0\u00a0And I think it tells the base, it's time to take a little break from the\u00a0Ivy League Judicial Appointment. We want people from the heartland from\u00a0places like Notre Dame. I think it reminds people that for all criticism of\u00a0Donald Trump, he did not appoint an Anthony Kennedy, a David Souter, a\u00a0Justice Roberts, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh or Barrett who are pretty\u00a0conservative and I think they'll be consistently conservative.\u00a0\u00a0I think that I kind of disagree with some people who said that it wasn't as\u00a0bad as Kavanaugh. I thought it will hurt the Democratic brand because\u00a0Hirono and Blumenthal and others, I think they went way overboard in\u00a0attacking somebody who was brilliant and decent, and one that was\u00a0gratuitous.\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, we're going to go into this election and see things,\u00a0Tucker, we haven't seen in our lifetime with ballots that appear out of\u00a0nowhere, contested election, something, I think that may make 2000 look\u00a0kind of minor in comparison. And I don't trust Justice Roberts to be a\u00a0conservative voice in those close decisions.\u00a0\u00a0I think it really diminishes the \"Hamlet -- to be or not to be\" role of\u00a0Justice Roberts because he is going to be less relevant than he was in the\u00a0past with the addition of Justice Barrett. It really tells the Republicans\u00a0that they can make great appointments like Clarence Thomas and Justice\u00a0Barrett, and they don't have to highlight race, class and gender.\u00a0\u00a0That these are incidental. They're not essential. Merit is what counts.\u00a0\u00a0And so I think when you look at Justice Barrett and compare to the her\u00a0Democratic counterparts, I think that becomes very evident that the\u00a0Republicans are going on merit, and they just happen to be people of all\u00a0different walks of life, and that's the way it should be.\u00a0\u00a0So it's a win-win for the Republican brand. I think helps Donald Trump and\u00a0it helps in a very critical point right now.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You're -- I'm still stuck on your description of what we may be\u00a0facing eight days from now, in the aftermath of the election and I hope\u00a0you're not right, but you usually are.\u00a0\u00a0Victor Davis Hanson, great to see\u00a0tonight. Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0HANSON:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So last week, if you were paying attention to the news, an\u00a0amazing story broke. A man called Tony Bobulinski, a former business\u00a0partner of Hunter Biden came out and said that he met personally with Joe\u00a0Biden back in 2017 in a hotel bar in Beverly Hills to talk about business\u00a0in China.\u00a0\u00a0That story was squelched by the media. It is very hard to find any details\u00a0about what Tony Bobulinski is alleging. Joe Biden hasn't really responded\u00a0to it.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow night, on this show, for the bulk of the hour, you will hear\u00a0directly from him. Our interview with Tony Bobulinski, 8:00 p.m., Eastern\u00a0tomorrow night.\u00a0\u00a0But first, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Kim Strassel is here to discuss that\u00a0story. She has done more reporting on it than probably anybody in the U.S.\u00a0media. We're happy to talk to her right after the break.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Republican senators, the ones who voted for Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0that does not include one, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, but the rest\u00a0just boarded a Capitol Hill Police Bus on the way to the White House. Coney\u00a0Barrett's swearing in ceremony will take place in the Rose Garden shortly.\u00a0Of course, we'll cover that when it happens.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow, by the way, we'll have an extensive interview on this show with a\u00a0man called Tony Bobulinski. You may have heard that name. He is a former\u00a0business partner of Hunter Biden.\u00a0\u00a0Text and his personal testimony both indicate he met personally with Joe\u00a0Biden to discuss a lucrative business deal in China. That's the story.\u00a0\u00a0The Biden campaign is not denying that meeting took place by the way.\u00a0They're just not talking about it and trying to dismiss the whole thing as\u00a0Russian propaganda. Tony Bobulinski is not on the other networks because\u00a0they've decided to bury the story. They want you to think it's a Russian\u00a0smear.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST:\u00a0 They are trying to take someone who right now\u00a0is choosing Biden. Do you get them by smearing Biden's surviving son?\u00a0\u00a0WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:\u00a0 Pushing these various smears against Joe Biden\u00a0and his son, Hunter Biden's.\u00a0\u00a0CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST:\u00a0 An increasingly desperate barrage of smears and\u00a0lies and disinformation and wild accusations.\u00a0\u00a0ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST:\u00a0 This President has seized on that potential Russian\u00a0misinformation provided by Giuliani and has tried to smear Biden with it.\u00a0\u00a0AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:\u00a0\u00a0 ... which was to smear him\u00a0with all this nonsense about Hunter Biden's finances.\u00a0\u00a0CLAIRE MCCASKILL, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST:\u00a0 If smearing Hunter Biden was\u00a0going to work, you know, Biden would not be ahead by almost 10 points.\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 He is the architect of the smears against Hunter Biden.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 These people are such liars, and they know what they're saying is\u00a0a lie. But at its core, this story is not about Hunter Biden, it is about\u00a0his father, the man who made Hunter Biden's decade's long lobbying career\u00a0possible, also made an almost 50-year lobbying career of Joe Biden's\u00a0brother, Jim possible.\u00a0\u00a0That is a story, and voters have a right to know a lot about it. They know\u00a0nothing at this point.\u00a0\u00a0The Biden campaign by the way has not denied the authenticity of a single\u00a0e-mail or text message. Not one. The smear. They know it's not a smear they\u00a0know it's true, but they are telling the rest of us the Russians are behind\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 The Intelligence Community warning the president that Giuliani was\u00a0being fed disinformation from the Russians, and we also know that Putin is\u00a0trying very hard to spread disinformation about Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0And so when you put the combination of Russia, Giuliani, and the President\u00a0together, it's just what it is. It's a smear campaign because he has\u00a0nothing he wants to talk about in this -- what is he running on?\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 The Russians. The infuriating part -- there are many infuriating\u00a0parts -- but one of them is Tony, Bobulinski. He is not a Russian agent. He\u00a0is a former Naval officer who served this country, as did many other\u00a0members of his family, and to dismiss him as some sort of tool of Russian\u00a0Intelligence is outrageous and it may have spurred his decision to come on\u00a0the show tomorrow night.\u00a0\u00a0But as of\u00a0tonight, what do we know about this story? Tony Bobulinski has\u00a0produced a lot of documents. Kim Strassel has read them. She is with \"The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\" She has laid this out very clearly, more than anyone\u00a0else. She joins us\u00a0tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Kim, thanks a lot for coming on. What do we know as of right now?\u00a0\u00a0KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Okay, well, I think this\u00a0story has two parts. The first one is Hunter and the important part about\u00a0this, when you read these texts and e-mails is that up until now, you know,\u00a0we knew about this shady Ukraine deal and the assumption was that Hunter\u00a0had been hired because of his dad, right?\u00a0\u00a0He didn't have any oil or gas experience, but now we know that that's\u00a0exactly what was happening in these deals because he brags about it. We\u00a0have texts and e-mails in which all of these partners are saying, you know,\u00a0we ought to be keeping more of the money here for the people that are\u00a0actually doing the work -- by the way, that's not Hunter -- you know, we\u00a0ought to be doing -- what does Hunter bring into this?\u00a0\u00a0And then Hunter in a rage coming and saying, don't you understand, I am the\u00a0deal. People are only doing this because they want the Biden name. This is\u00a0my family legacy.\u00a0\u00a0You've got one partner also saying, you know, to Tony, Bobulinski. Look, I\u00a0know for a fact the Chinese want this because of Hunter, and that's why\u00a0it's worth so much money. That's called influence peddling. That's called\u00a0access to important people.\u00a0\u00a0And that gets us to the second part of the story, which is Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 This meeting, and this is going to be the topic -- one of the\u00a0topics of our conversation with Tony Bobulinski tomorrow, but this meeting\u00a0that he says he had with Joe Biden from what we can tell took place. It's\u00a0real. He met with Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0Can you think of any reason that Joe Biden would meet with an investment\u00a0guy called Tony Bobulinski if it wasn't about business?\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 Look, this is all real. Can I just say that the smear argument,\u00a0a smear is when you make something up? Okay.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 This is now beyond a shadow of a doubt. \"The Wall Street\u00a0Journal,\" both its new side and its editorial page have made clear this\u00a0deal happened. Okay, these e-mails are out there and Joe was involved with\u00a0this.\u00a0\u00a0The question is to what degree? Now, Tony Bobulinski and the e-mails and\u00a0texts suggests that there was indeed a meeting. We also have this piece of\u00a0paper that laid out what was supposed to be the equity holdings in this\u00a0coming company. It says 20 percent to Hunter and then it says, you know,\u00a0maybe Hunter is going to hold 10 percent in addition for the big guy. Tony\u00a0Bobulinski says that that is Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the Biden campaign has not denied any of this. It hasn't answered any\u00a0questions on this.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 But it raises some of the big things. Joe Biden has said, first\u00a0and foremost that he doesn't discuss business with his son and he never\u00a0has.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So what?\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 This is a guy who is running on character and judgment, he\u00a0should have to answer this question about whether or not he was honest.\u00a0Beside the question of whether or not he was actually debating going into\u00a0business with a Chinese company with ties to the government and military.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 We have photographs of Joe Biden with Hunter and Hunter's\u00a0clients, including a mogul from Kazakhstan. I mean, he brought Hunter with\u00a0him to China as Vice President and introduced him around.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, this has been chronicled over many years. It's not like we just\u00a0learned all of this, but the press is pretending like oh, it's not true.\u00a0The same people who wrote these stories five years ago are now pretending\u00a0they don't know what we are talking about.\u00a0\u00a0In one sentence, have you ever seen anything like this where the entire\u00a0American media decides to lie as a group about something?\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 No, you know, for two weeks, they told us prove it that it's\u00a0true. We just showed that it's true and now they say there's nothing there\u00a0to see.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It's -- yes, there are going to be huge ramifications, I would\u00a0say from this kind of behavior long term.\u00a0\u00a0Kim Strassel, thank you for your bravery on the story because you have been\u00a0brave, I think.\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Amy Coney Barrett was just voted by the Senate to move to the\u00a0swearing in. So that's happening\u00a0tonight, 9:00 p.m. We're going to have\u00a0updates from the White House, from the Rose Garden in just a minute.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, experts raising new questions\u00a0tonight\u00a0about the coronavirus and where\u00a0it came from. There's a scientific consensus about that. But it turns out,\u00a0there are some pretty big holes in that consensus. Oh, they are not telling\u00a0you the truth again. Entirely possible.\u00a0\u00a0Alex Berenson after the break.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So we're almost a year into this pandemic. It was January when we\u00a0first reported on it. We still don't know exactly where it came from. We've\u00a0had a Chinese virologist, one of the first people to study the coronavirus\u00a0on this show twice. She says it was made in a lab and escaped. It was made\u00a0intentionally as a bio weapon.\u00a0\u00a0Now a biologist at M.I.T., Alina Chan is openly questioning the scientific\u00a0community's so-called consensus on where this came from. Chan wrote this\u00a0quote, \"The closest related virus genomes to the coronavirus cannot be\u00a0independently assembled due to missing data and unexplained\u00a0indiscrepancies.\"\u00a0\u00a0Chan also tweeted this quote, \"The public has little idea what happened/is\u00a0happening behind the scenes with journals and authors of coronavirus\u00a0papers.\" In other words, there is not really a consensus on where it came\u00a0from. Why don't we know? And is anyone working to find out honestly without\u00a0lying about it.\u00a0\u00a0Alex Berenson is one of the people who does not lie about this. He is the\u00a0author of \"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns Part 2,\" and\u00a0we're happy to have him on\u00a0tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Alex, I wish we had an hour for this topic. We don't because there's too\u00a0much going on. But just give us the state of the art on this question.\u00a0Where did this come from? What do we know? What don't we know?\u00a0\u00a0ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR:\u00a0 So very, very quickly, there's a lot we don't know.\u00a0And here's what we do know, anybody who raises this issue gets accused of\u00a0being a conspiracy theorist, and there are people in the scientific\u00a0community who are very deliberately conflating a couple of things.\u00a0\u00a0One is, is this a bio weapon? Okay, it's probably not a bio weapon,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0It wouldn't be a very good bio weapon because it didn't kill anybody who is\u00a0healthy. Okay.\u00a0\u00a0But the other question is, and I say anybody, obviously, there's always\u00a0exceptions. I have to throw that in or I'll get kicked at. The other\u00a0question is, could it have escaped from a lab? Probably a lab in China,\u00a0probably a lab in Wuhan where coronaviruses were being researched and where\u00a0scientists do what's called gain of function research.\u00a0\u00a0Gain of function research means that you manipulate the virus to try to\u00a0make it more virulent. That is the whole point of gain of function\u00a0research. The idea is, you're trying to figure out what natural virus might\u00a0become dangerous to humans if it mutated in various ways. And to do that,\u00a0and there's been a big argument about this in the scientific community for\u00a010 or 15 years, you either -- you either -- you often genetically modify\u00a0these viruses.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 You take bits of viruses, and you put them together, or you just\u00a0put various viruses in various animals and you wait for them to recombine.\u00a0Anyway, I know I don't have a lot of time. We don't know what happened\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0But we haven't found the animal host. We haven't found a virus in the wild\u00a0that's very, very much like SARS-CoV-2, and we have a giant lab that we\u00a0know had safety problems in China in 2018, in the same city where this\u00a0seemed to emerge from.\u00a0\u00a0This demands a real international investigation and it hasn't gotten one.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So maybe the obvious explanation is the correct one. I mean,\u00a0that's possible. Bottom line, it's possible,\u00a0\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 You know, that would be my prior, but you know, I'm just a\u00a0journalist. I'm not a scientist.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You're much more honest than the scientists we have in charge,\u00a0I've noticed. Alex Berenson, thank you for that. Good to see you.\u00a0\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 Thanks. Thanks,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So Amy Coney Barrett's swearing in ceremony begins in just a few\u00a0minutes. The vote is in, in case you're just joining us, 52 to 48. She got\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to have coverage of it straight ahead.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It seems like just yesterday we were wondering whether the\u00a0President would put forward a nominee before the election, he did of\u00a0course. And today, despite widespread expectations, he got her through. Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett, 52 to 48 was approved by the Senate. She is going to be\u00a0sworn in in the Rose Garden any moment.\u00a0\u00a0Shannon Bream is standing by for us right now. Hey, Shannon.\u00a0\u00a0SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hey,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0Well, yes, this first oath that she'll take will be administered by Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas. She knows him from her time clerking on the court for\u00a0Justice Scalia many years ago. Those two obviously were very close and she\u00a0will join in what now some people are speculating could become the Thomas\u00a0Court as he becomes really the influential conservative voice pulling\u00a0together potentially that wing. That's just the first oath.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow she will undergo the second oath that will be administered by\u00a0Chief Justice John Roberts. Once that happens, she will officially be a\u00a0Justice -- Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\u00a0\u00a0There's a lot of work waiting for her. There have been a number of\u00a0emergency appeals to the court regarding ballot measures, voting, mail-in\u00a0voting, and that kind of thing. They'll have a conference on Friday where\u00a0they vote on taking up new cases.\u00a0\u00a0And then immediately when they start oral arguments again on Monday, she\u00a0faces a couple of really big cases that will test her as a brand new\u00a0Justice.\u00a0\u00a0But tomorrow, it'll be official. She'll get to work --\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 What an amazing night. Every night is an amazing night right now.\u00a0Shannon Bream., Thanks so much for that.\u00a0\u00a0BREAM:\u00a0 Good to see you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 As we told you, tomorrow night, the bulk of this show, a sit down\u00a0interview with Tony Bobulinski, the man who says he met with Joe Biden\u00a0about business in China. We're going to get details that have not been out\u00a0there before and they're being of course suppressed by the rest of the\u00a0media. That's tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, the White House event, the swearing in for Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0starts in just a moment.\u00a0\u00a0Sean Hannity takes over right now.\u00a0\u00a0Hey Sean.\u00a0\u00a0END<Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

The count is\u00a0just wrapping up right now. We're hearing the roll.\u00a0\u00a0When she is sworn in this evening, and apparently she is going to be at\u00a09:00 p.m., the mother of seven will become the third Supreme Court Justice\u00a0appointed by this President, Donald Trump. No one expected that.\u00a0\u00a0For more on what this means for the court and for the country, we turn now\u00a0to Bret Baier. He is FOX News's chief political correspondent. He is the\u00a0anchor, of course, of \"Special Report\" on this channel every night.\u00a0\u00a0Bret, I mean, it's fair to say nobody expected this on many levels, but are\u00a0you surprised on a political level, that Republican Mitch McConnell was\u00a0able to hold all of these votes?\u00a0\u00a0BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 You know what,\u00a0Tucker,\u00a0I'm not, because of the superior delivery in the hearing of Judge Barrett.\u00a0She convinced the couple of wavering Republicans like Mitt Romney and Lisa\u00a0Murkowski that she was such a good jurist, such a good judge that she\u00a0deserved this this vote\u00a0tonight.\u00a0\u00a0It's historic. I mean, this is the third Supreme Court Justice for\u00a0President Trump. She is the youngest Supreme Court Justice as of\u00a0tonight,\u00a0and it is happening 38 days after the death of the liberal icon Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg.\u00a0\u00a0Democrats are apoplectic. Chuck Schumer said this is the darkest day in the\u00a0history of the U.S. Senate 231 years. And he pointed his finger at\u00a0Republicans on the other side of the well.\u00a0\u00a0Mitch McConnell said the reason we were able to do it in 2016, 2018, and\u00a02020, is because we won the Majority and we had the White House, and so he\u00a0made his point.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Man, I mean, it's a sweet moment for Republicans, but also maybe\u00a0a bitter moment for some Republican voters because it illustrates that the\u00a0Republican-led Senate can achieve things when it wants to.\u00a0\u00a0You think of all the policies that voters ratified in the 2016 election\u00a0that didn't make their way through the Senate, but when they want to do\u00a0something, they can do it with speed and certainty. So what will the\u00a0Democratic response to this would be, do you think?\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 This is their biggest.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It is. I agree with that.\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 This is the biggest win by far, not only the three Supreme Court\u00a0Justices, but the dozens and dozens of Federal Judges on different courts\u00a0that President Trump and Senator McConnell have steered into nomination and\u00a0confirmation.\u00a0\u00a0The Democrats' response to this was signaled by Senator Schumer, who said,\u00a0you have lost your credibility pointing to Republicans, and when we control\u00a0the majority, you have lost your ability to tell us how to run it, which is\u00a0sort of a foreshadowing to what has been talked about, and that is doing\u00a0away with the filibuster and possibly packing the court or doing some other\u00a0major systemic changes to the Judicial Branch.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes. And not just Judicial, bringing in Puerto Rico as a state,\u00a0and maybe other things as well.\u00a0\u00a0It's interesting, we didn't see the attacks on Judge Barrett that a lot of\u00a0us predicted. Why do you think that was?\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Because we were just days away from an election. And there wasn't -- there was a fear of a backlash from people who looked at Judge Barrett,\u00a0the mother of seven, a really accomplished jurist, and said, why are you\u00a0going after this person?\u00a0\u00a0I think that they looked at the electoral fallout of talking about her\u00a0religion, and they stayed away from it and really focused on Obamacare and\u00a0the case coming before the Supreme Court in just a matter of days.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Amazing. Just hearing that, the vote is still technically open,\u00a0but Republicans have secured 52 votes. So this is a fait accompli, what\u00a0happens next?\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Next, there will be a swearing in. That will be done by Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas, a ceremony at the White House. And obviously, we don't\u00a0have all of the details of that. The first ceremony of her nomination\u00a0caused quite a stir when all of those folks got sick after that Rose Garden\u00a0event.\u00a0\u00a0But I think there's a lot of protocols in place. It'll be\u00a0tonight\u00a0sometime,\u00a0and then there will be an official swearing in at the court, but she will\u00a0go to work right away.\u00a0\u00a0And just\u00a0tonight,\u00a0Tucker, the Supreme Court ruled five to three in favor of\u00a0G.O.P. blocking efforts to extend the absentee ballots in Wisconsin by six\u00a0days. So just\u00a0tonight, the Supreme Court is operating on election cases\u00a0that Justice Barrett will be a part of as of tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 I can't resist asking this, do you think it is possible that soon\u00a0to be Justice Barrett could weigh in on election related -- post-election\u00a0related cases.\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 I think it's clear from her hearing that she is not recusing\u00a0herself nor do legal experts think she has to, many of them. Some obviously\u00a0do and the Democrats say she should. But I think she will be a part of all\u00a0of these cases.\u00a0\u00a0And if it comes to states having challenges about their electors come\u00a0December if there is a Secretary of State that is one party and a state\u00a0legislature that's another party, and they are battling over who the\u00a0electors will be in an undecided election because of who didn't sign\u00a0absentee ballots, yes, she could very well be a part of a Supreme Court\u00a0deciding the next President.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It's all so amazing. Bret Baier, thank you for the guidance on\u00a0all of this. I really appreciate it. Good to see you.\u00a0\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 You bet.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, ahead of the Senate confirmation vote\u00a0tonight, Democrats,\u00a0as Bret Baier just told you were absolutely apoplectic, the darkest day in\u00a0the history of the Senate; Chuck Schumer said from New York. They\u00a0threatened there will be consequences to what you just saw. The Democratic\u00a0senator from Connecticut Richard Blumenthal said this.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):\u00a0 Our Republican colleagues are shattering\u00a0the norms and breaking the rules and breaking their word, and there will be\u00a0consequences. There inevitably are consequences when one person breaks her\u00a0or his word.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Her or his word? Well, that's Amy Coney Barrett, of course he is\u00a0talking about and the idea is that she would somehow undo Obamacare,\u00a0entirely invalidate it. There's no indication in her previous decisions\u00a0that she would do something like that. But that has been a consistent\u00a0talking point among Democrats for the past several weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Listen to Cory Booker, who by the way, voted himself to undo, to abolish\u00a0Obamacare. Listen to Cory Booker warn you that Amy Coney Barrett will do\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): A future without the ACA looks like being forced\u00a0to sell your house if you can't afford your healthcare. It looks like not\u00a0having access to a doctor when you're sick. It looks like having to choose\u00a0between paying for groceries and paying for medicine.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Unfortunately, now that Amy Coney Barrett is on the Supreme\u00a0Court, you're going to lose your house, you're going to starve and you're\u00a0probably going to dive in an infection next time you stub your toe. So get\u00a0psyched for that.\u00a0\u00a0Charlie Hurt is excited. He is the opinion editor at \"The Washington\u00a0Times.\" He joins us\u00a0tonight. So Charlie, they are taking your house away?\u00a0\u00a0CHARLIE HURT, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Yes, no kidding. And, you\u00a0know, it's the darkest day in the United States history. That's quite\u00a0something else.\u00a0\u00a0You know, it's easy to look at this and see this as a tremendous victory,\u00a0and it is a huge victory for conservatives and for President Trump and for\u00a0Republicans. But I have to say, it's also a shocking moment in that it\u00a0reveals just how broken the system is.\u00a0\u00a0There are going to be nearly 50 senators voting against this woman. There\u00a0are going to be at least 48 senators who are going to vote against this\u00a0eminently qualified woman to sit on the Supreme Court based on basically\u00a0her family story, based on the fact, based on a religion, based on all of\u00a0these crazy things that we've heard from the left ever since she was\u00a0nominated, and throughout the entire process.\u00a0\u00a0We listened to Democrats sitting on the Senate Judiciary Committee, people\u00a0like Cory Booker, talking about how the process was a sham and it was a\u00a0charade and a circus. No, it's not a sham. It's called the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0HURT:\u00a0 But that's what these people think of the Constitution today. And\u00a0that's what they did -- and the reason that people like Cory Booker --\u00a0that's a great clip, you showed -- the reason that Cory Booker is talking\u00a0like that on that clip, is because they don't believe the courts are the\u00a0courts anymore. They don't believe the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0They believe that it's a super legislature. It's where all of the details\u00a0of Obamacare are supposed to be worked out and extended by an unelected\u00a0branch of government that serves for life and is answerable to no one.\u00a0That's what they believe.\u00a0\u00a0Half of the United States Senate, half of our Congress today believes that\u00a0and the way that Donald Trump has broken them, has broken through with the\u00a0biggest development in this entire judicial fight since the Supreme Court\u00a0first invented abortion rights as a constitutional right in the\u00a0Constitution, which of course, doesn't exist except in the numbers,\u00a0whatever the hell that is.\u00a0\u00a0The reason that he did this is -- the reason that Donald Trump is the only\u00a0one who have done it is that he made the argument that you know what -- the\u00a0Constitution means what it means. It means what it says and American voters\u00a0overwhelmingly understand that and believe that.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, nearly 50 senators in the United States Senate, don't even\u00a0understand that.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You've heard Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts today suggest the\u00a0Constitution itself was racist and sexist and homophobic.\u00a0\u00a0HURT:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Charlie Hurt. Thanks so much.\u00a0\u00a0We should tell you by the way, the vote is now officially completed. It is\u00a0closed 52 votes in favor of Amy Coney Barrett ascending to the High Court,\u00a048 against.\u00a0\u00a0Now it is onto that special swearing in at the White House that's slated to\u00a0begin as this show wraps up at 9:00 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0Joe Biden has refused to rule out responding to all of this by packing the\u00a0Supreme Court if elected President. In a recent interview, he said he would\u00a0form a, quote, \"National Commission\" to investigate that topic.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 If elected, what I will do\u00a0is I'll put together a National Commission -- a bipartisan commission of\u00a0scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, liberal and\u00a0conservatives, and I will ask them to over 180 days come back to me with\u00a0recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it's getting\u00a0out of whack in the way which it has been handled.\u00a0\u00a0And it's not about court packing, there's a number of other things that our\u00a0constitutional scholars have debated, and I've looked to see what\u00a0recommendations that Commission might make.\u00a0\u00a0QUESTION:\u00a0 So you're telling us you're going to study this issue about\u00a0whether to pack the court.\u00a0\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 No, whether there's a number of alternatives that are well beyond\u00a0packing.\u00a0\u00a0QUESTION:\u00a0 This is a live ball.\u00a0\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 Oh, it is a live ball.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It is a bipartisan commission. So it's Sandy Cortez and Bill\u00a0Kristol who are going to look at it from both sides. Where is this all\u00a0going?\u00a0\u00a0Jenna Ellis is a constitutional attorney. She is a campaign adviser, a\u00a0senior adviser to the Trump re-elect, and she joins us\u00a0tonight. Jenna,\u00a0thanks so much for coming on.\u00a0\u00a0JENNA ELLIS, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR LEGAL ADVISER:\u00a0 Great to see you,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So, give us your most sober analysis of where you think this is\u00a0really going?\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS:\u00a0 Well, of course, Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrats simply\u00a0want to change the rules, and they don't care about the Constitution. They\u00a0don't care about our system of government.\u00a0\u00a0They would prefer to keep the Judicial Branch as a super legislature and as\u00a0an activist majority, and that's what we've seen through the past 50 and 60\u00a0years.\u00a0\u00a0What Joe Biden is expressly ignoring is what Alexander Hamilton said so\u00a0perfectly in Federalist 76, through 78, which is that the Judicial Branch\u00a0is designed to be the weakest branch, only to be able to review the policy\u00a0and law making decisions of the two political branches. It's not supposed\u00a0to act with partisan interest.\u00a0\u00a0And Hamilton even acknowledges in the Federalist Papers that the reason\u00a0that the nomination is vested in the President pursuant to the Constitution\u00a0is because he would expressly not have the special interest in lawmaking\u00a0contemplations that the House or the Senate would.\u00a0\u00a0And so Joe Biden is forgetting all of that. He doesn't want to acknowledge\u00a0that. He doesn't want our system of government to operate how it is\u00a0designed. He wants to completely throw it out because the design and\u00a0functionality of our Constitution, of our limited powers given to\u00a0government is a stopgap and it's actually preventing the Democrats from\u00a0putting through their activist partisan policy agenda.\u00a0\u00a0If they are so worried about Amy Coney Barrett acknowledging that the ACA\u00a0is unconstitutional, then maybe they should be very careful to actually put\u00a0forward laws that are constitutional instead of being so concerned about\u00a0someone who actually wants to be a judge.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, or just improve it in the Congress as the system intends.\u00a0All of this poison, all of these \"Let's tear down the system and create one\u00a0party control of the country,\" all of these ideas come out of the\u00a0universities, the ones that are getting billions in Federal subsidies every\u00a0year. Why are we paying for this crap?\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS:\u00a0 We shouldn't be. And that's what President Trump has even said\u00a0about making sure that we take away CRT programming and all of these other\u00a0things to universities that are teaching our children to hate America\u00a0instead of love its design and love the freedoms and liberties that we\u00a0cherish. And that's going to be his lasting legacy.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, and we're a week away from the election. I wish someone had\u00a0thought about this earlier because it really is, in my view, a grave -- a\u00a0grave threat. Jenna Ellis, great to see\u00a0tonight. Thank you so much.\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS:\u00a0 Great to see you, too,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So as we told you, it is done. The vote is over, 52 to 48.\u00a0Republicans prevailed\u00a0tonight. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana was one of\u00a0them. He just voted for Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation and we're happy to\u00a0have him on the show right after.\u00a0\u00a0Senator thanks so much for coming on\u00a0tonight. Why did you vote in favor of\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett?\u00a0\u00a0SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA):\u00a0 Because this is a victory for our founders. It\u00a0was never,\u00a0Tucker, about her qualifications. You would have to be barking\u00a0mad to think that she is not qualified in terms of intellect, in terms of\u00a0temperament, in terms of integrity.\u00a0\u00a0This fight was about who is going to make social policy in the United\u00a0States -- the Congress or the unelected Federal Judiciary? And we talked\u00a0about that at the conceptual level so much.\u00a0\u00a0Let me give you a specific example. Many transgender women want to\u00a0participate in female athletics. A transgender woman, as you know,\u00a0Tucker,\u00a0is a person who is born a male with the male characteristics, testosterone,\u00a0for example, who identifies as a female.\u00a0\u00a0And now many of those transgender women would like to participate in\u00a0women's athletics. If they are allowed to do that because of their elevated\u00a0testosterone, they are going to win every contest every time.\u00a0\u00a0Who do you think our founders intended to make a decision about that? The\u00a0people through their elected representatives in Congress.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0\u00a0KENNEDY:\u00a0 Or nine unelected members of a Supreme Court appointed for life.\u00a0It's called judicial restraint, and Judge Barrett understands that, our\u00a0founders intended it, and that's why this was a victory\u00a0tonight\u00a0for our\u00a0founders.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 What a great example that is. The Congress can weigh in on all\u00a0this stuff. That is their job. And you wish they wouldn't boot it up the\u00a0Supreme Court because it corrodes the system, as you just so eloquently\u00a0explained. Senator, thank you so much.\u00a0\u00a0KENNEDY:\u00a0 Thank you,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Great to see you.\u00a0\u00a0Well, if there was a high point in these confirmation hearings, it is a\u00a0subjective call, of course, but from our point of view, it came from Mazie\u00a0Hirono, unquestionably, the shining intellectual star of the United States\u00a0Senate.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to choose your most trenchant observation in the past month\u00a0indeed of her career. But if you had to pick just one, it would be this\u00a0moment. It was so profound, that it literally changed our dictionary.\u00a0Watch.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI):\u00a0 Not once, but twice, you used the term sexual\u00a0preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community, and let me make clear,\u00a0sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term.\u00a0\u00a0It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a\u00a0choice. It is not. Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Sexual preference is not a choice. It's not a preference. It's\u00a0just like Mazie Hirono's intellect. She didn't choose to be that brilliant,\u00a0and in some ways, it's a burden, but she was born that way.\u00a0\u00a0Tammy Bruce is the host of \"Get Tammy Bruce\" on FOX Nation. She is the\u00a0person we call, with your particularly naughty intellectual problem, a\u00a0Gordian knot tied by Mazie Hirono. What does this mean? Will you explain\u00a0this to us, please?\u00a0\u00a0TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 So I will never forgive you.\u00a0This is so difficult.\u00a0\u00a0The fact of the matter is, Senator Hirono is wrong. Her remarks actually\u00a0come from a blue check guy on Twitter who decided it was offensive. The\u00a0fact of the matter is, what's ridiculous is that this argument, the word\u00a0police are coming from the side of politics that say that there are dozens\u00a0of genders and that whatever you say you are, you are.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, and this is the irony, it is the gay community especially and\u00a0liberals who should not be embracing this idea that someone else controls\u00a0the nature of who you are, how you identify, and the words you're supposed\u00a0to use it.\u00a0\u00a0And as a newsflash, for me as a gay woman, it is a sexual preference. No\u00a0one out there, not some young man with his blue check, no senator is going\u00a0to tell me how I'm going to identify. It is the height of bigotry because\u00a0it goes into this idea,\u00a0Tucker, that we're all the same, that maybe we all\u00a0look the same, and you can't tell us apart, and that we think the same and\u00a0that we vote the same.\u00a0\u00a0You know, we hear this through the Democratic Party now from Joe Biden\u00a0about black Americans. Now, all the gays are exactly the same, and there\u00a0are a lot of gay people watching now who are liberal, who are realizing,\u00a0\"I'm different from them.\" Right?\u00a0\u00a0We think differently. We have different ideas.\u00a0\u00a0So this speaks to the nature of liberalism, and let me say, Amy Coney\u00a0Barrett, a perfect example of what this country needs, that the\u00a0Constitution and the strength of that Constitution keeps minorities in this\u00a0country safe. That's how important she is.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 How nicely put was that? That's right. We're human beings. We're\u00a0not members of groups. We are not categories.\u00a0\u00a0And by the way, Senator Hirono, you're allowed to be attracted with anyone\u00a0you want. So why don't you back off. I wish someone would -- well, you just\u00a0said that much more eloquently than I did. Tammy Bruce, great to see you.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0BRUCE:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, throughout the hearings that we saw in the past couple of\u00a0weeks, Democrats treated Amy Coney Barrett's pro-life beliefs like they\u00a0were some kind of disorder, some kind of grotesque, malformity that she has\u00a0in her soul.\u00a0\u00a0Dianne Feinstein was caught on a hot mic muttering about it. Not everyone\u00a0agrees though and in cities like New York, more African-American babies are\u00a0aborted than are born and some people don't think that's a good thing.\u00a0Planned Parenthood is entirely in favor of it. They were started in order\u00a0to do that, to limit the black population in this country.\u00a0\u00a0But some are awake enough to be offended by that, and Kanye West is one of\u00a0them. He is running for President and he made that point recently. Listen\u00a0to this.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0KANYE WEST, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 With abortion culture, there are 1,000\u00a0black children aborted a day -- daily. We are in genocide. We -- so more\u00a0black children have died since February than people have died of COVID, and\u00a0everyone wears a mask.\u00a0\u00a0So it's a matter of where are we turning a blind's eye to?\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You've got to love how the crazy people are the only ones who see\u00a0things clearly. A reflection of our moment.\u00a0\u00a0Candace Owens is the author of the book \"Blackout: How Black America is\u00a0making its Second Escape from the Democratic Plantation.\" She joins us\u00a0tonight. That's -- the clarity of that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not promoting anybody's presidential campaign here, but I mean, just\u00a0the clarity of that observation is so overwhelming. You wonder how anyone\u00a0could hear that and disagree with it because it's just so true.\u00a0\u00a0CANDACE OWENS, AUTHOR, \"BLACKOUT\"\"\u00a0 It overwhelms me because I feel as\u00a0though many of us have been fighting for these conversations to be had for\u00a0a very long time. When I say many of us, I mean black conservatives and\u00a0what he is really getting at is selective outrage culture.\u00a0\u00a0You and I know who Margaret Sanger was. It's not taught in schools, but\u00a0we're supposed to be outraged because Amy Coney Barrett believes in life\u00a0and we're not supposed to be outraged that a eugenicist founded Planned\u00a0Parenthood with black American being targets, right, we are her targets.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Exactly. Exactly.\u00a0\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 She wrote extensively about how she believes in the extermination\u00a0of certain races, people that she thought were not fit to be in this\u00a0society, that she did not want the government take care of and black\u00a0Americans were among them -- and most people don't know this stuff.\u00a0\u00a0And here we have Kanye West who is speaking out and saying, \"You know what,\u00a0this is wrong.\" So while the left is dressing up and playing Halloween,\u00a0pretending that we live in some dystopian reality because Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0is talking about pro-life, black Americans are living a dystopian reality,\u00a0thanks to Democratic policies, which have results in half the black\u00a0population.\u00a0\u00a0Think about that,\u00a0Tucker. The black American population would be double\u00a0today if it were not for abortion.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 And that is -- and I am sorry to laugh as you were speaking. What\u00a0you were saying was so sad. But I just -- when you hear someone say it that\u00a0clearly, it just -- it makes you laugh at the absurdity of the\u00a0conversations that dominate our politics that are so far from the reality\u00a0of it. I mean, no one ever talks as plainly as you just did.\u00a0\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 Yes. And it's true, and it's been such a suffering because the\u00a0education system,\u00a0Tucker, is being wiped. We are replacing hard academics\u00a0with psychological conditioning.\u00a0\u00a0Black Americans are learning about Black Lives Matter and how depressing it\u00a0is and we should be blaming white Americans for everything. But we're not\u00a0learning about our real history. How we have been conditioned to allow\u00a0Planned Parenthood clinics into all of our neighborhoods, over 63 percent\u00a0of them are in black and Hispanic neighborhoods.\u00a0\u00a0This is systematic targeting. If you're looking for systemic racism, you\u00a0may want to take a look at Democratic policies. You may want to take a look\u00a0at why we as a society are saying there's something wrong with a woman who\u00a0believes in life, who believes that you know what, more black children\u00a0should be born alive. We shouldn't have 400 out of 1,000 black babies\u00a0aborted compared to white Americans where it's 103 out of 1,000 births.\u00a0\u00a0So this is this is really important stuff, and you're right, it is laugh --\u00a0it's laughable that, you know, we've come to this circumstance where people\u00a0want us to be outraged about other things and not this.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Exactly. I was about to say, why is it left to you and Kanye\u00a0West, of all people, to say this, but I really think that when people hear\u00a0what you just said, the overwhelming majority, no matter who they vote for,\u00a0have to acknowledge it's true. What you said is true, and I think the more\u00a0you say it out loud, the more that conversation changes toward a real\u00a0conversation, and I appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Candace Owens, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, Democrats are still pretending that Amy Coney Barrett's\u00a0confirmation is illegitimate. What does that mean, exactly? If it's really\u00a0illegitimate, then that's a crisis. So what are they saying?\u00a0\u00a0Well, their argument appears to be that we all need to honor Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg's dying wish, which is really our new Constitution. If Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg said something in the way out, that's basically our Bill of Rights\u00a0now.\u00a0\u00a0Elizabeth Warren explained that on the Senate floor just yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 It has also\u00a0been 37 days since Mitch McConnell declared he would disregard Ruth's most\u00a0fervent wish and move ahead with a corrupt and illegitimate process to fill\u00a0her seat on the Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0Let's be very clear, if Trump and the Republicans succeed in ramming this\u00a0nomination through, the American people will expect us to use every tool we\u00a0have to undo the damage and restore the courts' integrity.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Okay, so what she just told you was following the letter of the\u00a0Constitution and it's prescribed that as a Supreme Court Justice passes\u00a0away, how do you replace that justice? We just saw what the Constitution\u00a0tells us to do. That's illegitimate.\u00a0\u00a0What's legitimate is following the supposedly final words of a departed\u00a0Supreme Court Justice. No, that's a religion, what you're describing.\u00a0That's a religion. Scary.\u00a0\u00a0Ian Prior is Senior Counsel at the Article III Project and a former\u00a0spokesman for the Department of Justice. We're happy to have him on\u00a0tonight. Ian, thanks so much for coming.\u00a0\u00a0So when you were at D.O.J., when you first started, they brief you and tell\u00a0you that all law in this country emanates from the dying wishes of left-wing Supreme Court Justices.\u00a0\u00a0IAN PRIOR, SENIOR COUNSEL, ARTICLE III PROJECT:\u00a0 That was a manual that we\u00a0had to read our first day, and it was all the dying wishes that we've seen\u00a0in the Republic over the past 250 years and we had to make sure that, you\u00a0know, when we responded to press inquiries, we were cognizant of that law.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It's just so absurd, and you keep hearing people repeat it. I\u00a0mean, like trained seal, \"Well, it was her dying wish ...\" How do we get to\u00a0a place like this? It's so stupid.\u00a0\u00a0PRIOR:\u00a0 It's stupid, but it's also dangerous because it is delegitimizing\u00a0the Constitution. And you talk -- you know, you talk about the tools --\u00a0Elizabeth Warren's tools -- well, what are they right? Let's start off with\u00a0the Democrats wanting to get rid of the legislative filibuster. So that\u00a0means 51 votes will get everything passed.\u00a0\u00a0What they're going to do from there is then expand the Supreme Court to\u00a0have a liberal majority, and then these two other factors people don't talk\u00a0about as much, but D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood. That's four more\u00a0Democratic senators, a handful of members of the House and then they want\u00a0to lower the voting age to 16.\u00a0\u00a0You are potentially looking at a perpetual Democratic majority in the\u00a0Legislative Branch, in the Judiciary Branch and the United States of\u00a0America becoming the Orwellian States of America.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, everything you just mentioned comes out of the university,\u00a0too. Those are all ideas that incubated at Yale Law School and Harvard Law\u00a0School. The places that the rest of us are sending our tax dollars every\u00a0year. It is time to rethink that.\u00a0\u00a0If you want structural change, that's one of them. Ian, thanks so much for\u00a0coming on\u00a0tonight. Appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Before we get our next guest, our producer just said in my ear, our\u00a0producers watch the other channels during the show that MSNBC -- I'm just\u00a0going to go on faith in this because I didn't see it, but our producer said\u00a0MSNBC did not acknowledge Amy Coney Barrett's elevation to the Supreme\u00a0Court. It just happened moments ago, 24 minutes ago, and they ignored it\u00a0completely, which tells you a lot.\u00a0\u00a0So what does this all mean? Amy Coney Barrett is going to serve in the\u00a0Supreme Court of the United States. For the broader view, we go as we\u00a0always want to, to Victor Davis Hanson. He is a Fellow at the Hoover\u00a0Institution. We're happy to have him on\u00a0tonight. Professor, thanks for\u00a0coming on. How do you assess this?\u00a0\u00a0VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION:\u00a0 Thank you. Well, I\u00a0didn't know whether to laugh or cry when Richard Blumenthal, the Yale Law\u00a0graduate says there's consequences to not telling the truth, or the Harvard\u00a0Law Professor, Elizabeth Warren creates a new rule about dying justice. I\u00a0mean, it told you what the Ivy League has become.\u00a0\u00a0But past, present, future very quickly,\u00a0Tucker, Harry Reid was hubristic in\u00a02013 when he thought he was going to ram through these appointments without\u00a0the judicial filibuster all the way through the end of Hillary's second\u00a0term in 2024 and a nemesis hit him. They had three chances to take the\u00a0Senate: '14, '16 and '18. They couldn't do it.\u00a0\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg had all sorts of opportunities in her early 80s with\u00a0her poor health to step down and give that appointment to Obama. So a lot\u00a0of it is just teeth gnashing that's their own problem.\u00a0\u00a0But the President -- I think it helps Donald Trump in the next eight days\u00a0because it reminds that problematic independent woman suburban voter that\u00a0you can do things like Justice Barrett, you can have children. You can be\u00a0religious. You can have a job and you can do it with grace and you can be\u00a0conservative.\u00a0\u00a0And I think it tells the base, it's time to take a little break from the\u00a0Ivy League Judicial Appointment. We want people from the heartland from\u00a0places like Notre Dame. I think it reminds people that for all criticism of\u00a0Donald Trump, he did not appoint an Anthony Kennedy, a David Souter, a\u00a0Justice Roberts, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh or Barrett who are pretty\u00a0conservative and I think they'll be consistently conservative.\u00a0\u00a0I think that I kind of disagree with some people who said that it wasn't as\u00a0bad as Kavanaugh. I thought it will hurt the Democratic brand because\u00a0Hirono and Blumenthal and others, I think they went way overboard in\u00a0attacking somebody who was brilliant and decent, and one that was\u00a0gratuitous.\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, we're going to go into this election and see things,\u00a0Tucker, we haven't seen in our lifetime with ballots that appear out of\u00a0nowhere, contested election, something, I think that may make 2000 look\u00a0kind of minor in comparison. And I don't trust Justice Roberts to be a\u00a0conservative voice in those close decisions.\u00a0\u00a0I think it really diminishes the \"Hamlet -- to be or not to be\" role of\u00a0Justice Roberts because he is going to be less relevant than he was in the\u00a0past with the addition of Justice Barrett. It really tells the Republicans\u00a0that they can make great appointments like Clarence Thomas and Justice\u00a0Barrett, and they don't have to highlight race, class and gender.\u00a0\u00a0That these are incidental. They're not essential. Merit is what counts.\u00a0\u00a0And so I think when you look at Justice Barrett and compare to the her\u00a0Democratic counterparts, I think that becomes very evident that the\u00a0Republicans are going on merit, and they just happen to be people of all\u00a0different walks of life, and that's the way it should be.\u00a0\u00a0So it's a win-win for the Republican brand. I think helps Donald Trump and\u00a0it helps in a very critical point right now.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You're -- I'm still stuck on your description of what we may be\u00a0facing eight days from now, in the aftermath of the election and I hope\u00a0you're not right, but you usually are.\u00a0\u00a0Victor Davis Hanson, great to see\u00a0tonight. Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0HANSON:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So last week, if you were paying attention to the news, an\u00a0amazing story broke. A man called Tony Bobulinski, a former business\u00a0partner of Hunter Biden came out and said that he met personally with Joe\u00a0Biden back in 2017 in a hotel bar in Beverly Hills to talk about business\u00a0in China.\u00a0\u00a0That story was squelched by the media. It is very hard to find any details\u00a0about what Tony Bobulinski is alleging. Joe Biden hasn't really responded\u00a0to it.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow night, on this show, for the bulk of the hour, you will hear\u00a0directly from him. Our interview with Tony Bobulinski, 8:00 p.m., Eastern\u00a0tomorrow night.\u00a0\u00a0But first, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Kim Strassel is here to discuss that\u00a0story. She has done more reporting on it than probably anybody in the U.S.\u00a0media. We're happy to talk to her right after the break.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Republican senators, the ones who voted for Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0that does not include one, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, but the rest\u00a0just boarded a Capitol Hill Police Bus on the way to the White House. Coney\u00a0Barrett's swearing in ceremony will take place in the Rose Garden shortly.\u00a0Of course, we'll cover that when it happens.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow, by the way, we'll have an extensive interview on this show with a\u00a0man called Tony Bobulinski. You may have heard that name. He is a former\u00a0business partner of Hunter Biden.\u00a0\u00a0Text and his personal testimony both indicate he met personally with Joe\u00a0Biden to discuss a lucrative business deal in China. That's the story.\u00a0\u00a0The Biden campaign is not denying that meeting took place by the way.\u00a0They're just not talking about it and trying to dismiss the whole thing as\u00a0Russian propaganda. Tony Bobulinski is not on the other networks because\u00a0they've decided to bury the story. They want you to think it's a Russian\u00a0smear.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST:\u00a0 They are trying to take someone who right now\u00a0is choosing Biden. Do you get them by smearing Biden's surviving son?\u00a0\u00a0WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:\u00a0 Pushing these various smears against Joe Biden\u00a0and his son, Hunter Biden's.\u00a0\u00a0CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST:\u00a0 An increasingly desperate barrage of smears and\u00a0lies and disinformation and wild accusations.\u00a0\u00a0ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST:\u00a0 This President has seized on that potential Russian\u00a0misinformation provided by Giuliani and has tried to smear Biden with it.\u00a0\u00a0AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:\u00a0\u00a0 ... which was to smear him\u00a0with all this nonsense about Hunter Biden's finances.\u00a0\u00a0CLAIRE MCCASKILL, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST:\u00a0 If smearing Hunter Biden was\u00a0going to work, you know, Biden would not be ahead by almost 10 points.\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 He is the architect of the smears against Hunter Biden.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 These people are such liars, and they know what they're saying is\u00a0a lie. But at its core, this story is not about Hunter Biden, it is about\u00a0his father, the man who made Hunter Biden's decade's long lobbying career\u00a0possible, also made an almost 50-year lobbying career of Joe Biden's\u00a0brother, Jim possible.\u00a0\u00a0That is a story, and voters have a right to know a lot about it. They know\u00a0nothing at this point.\u00a0\u00a0The Biden campaign by the way has not denied the authenticity of a single\u00a0e-mail or text message. Not one. The smear. They know it's not a smear they\u00a0know it's true, but they are telling the rest of us the Russians are behind\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 The Intelligence Community warning the president that Giuliani was\u00a0being fed disinformation from the Russians, and we also know that Putin is\u00a0trying very hard to spread disinformation about Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0And so when you put the combination of Russia, Giuliani, and the President\u00a0together, it's just what it is. It's a smear campaign because he has\u00a0nothing he wants to talk about in this -- what is he running on?\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 The Russians. The infuriating part -- there are many infuriating\u00a0parts -- but one of them is Tony, Bobulinski. He is not a Russian agent. He\u00a0is a former Naval officer who served this country, as did many other\u00a0members of his family, and to dismiss him as some sort of tool of Russian\u00a0Intelligence is outrageous and it may have spurred his decision to come on\u00a0the show tomorrow night.\u00a0\u00a0But as of\u00a0tonight, what do we know about this story? Tony Bobulinski has\u00a0produced a lot of documents. Kim Strassel has read them. She is with \"The\u00a0Wall Street Journal.\" She has laid this out very clearly, more than anyone\u00a0else. She joins us\u00a0tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Kim, thanks a lot for coming on. What do we know as of right now?\u00a0\u00a0KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Okay, well, I think this\u00a0story has two parts. The first one is Hunter and the important part about\u00a0this, when you read these texts and e-mails is that up until now, you know,\u00a0we knew about this shady Ukraine deal and the assumption was that Hunter\u00a0had been hired because of his dad, right?\u00a0\u00a0He didn't have any oil or gas experience, but now we know that that's\u00a0exactly what was happening in these deals because he brags about it. We\u00a0have texts and e-mails in which all of these partners are saying, you know,\u00a0we ought to be keeping more of the money here for the people that are\u00a0actually doing the work -- by the way, that's not Hunter -- you know, we\u00a0ought to be doing -- what does Hunter bring into this?\u00a0\u00a0And then Hunter in a rage coming and saying, don't you understand, I am the\u00a0deal. People are only doing this because they want the Biden name. This is\u00a0my family legacy.\u00a0\u00a0You've got one partner also saying, you know, to Tony, Bobulinski. Look, I\u00a0know for a fact the Chinese want this because of Hunter, and that's why\u00a0it's worth so much money. That's called influence peddling. That's called\u00a0access to important people.\u00a0\u00a0And that gets us to the second part of the story, which is Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 This meeting, and this is going to be the topic -- one of the\u00a0topics of our conversation with Tony Bobulinski tomorrow, but this meeting\u00a0that he says he had with Joe Biden from what we can tell took place. It's\u00a0real. He met with Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0Can you think of any reason that Joe Biden would meet with an investment\u00a0guy called Tony Bobulinski if it wasn't about business?\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 Look, this is all real. Can I just say that the smear argument,\u00a0a smear is when you make something up? Okay.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 This is now beyond a shadow of a doubt. \"The Wall Street\u00a0Journal,\" both its new side and its editorial page have made clear this\u00a0deal happened. Okay, these e-mails are out there and Joe was involved with\u00a0this.\u00a0\u00a0The question is to what degree? Now, Tony Bobulinski and the e-mails and\u00a0texts suggests that there was indeed a meeting. We also have this piece of\u00a0paper that laid out what was supposed to be the equity holdings in this\u00a0coming company. It says 20 percent to Hunter and then it says, you know,\u00a0maybe Hunter is going to hold 10 percent in addition for the big guy. Tony\u00a0Bobulinski says that that is Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the Biden campaign has not denied any of this. It hasn't answered any\u00a0questions on this.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 But it raises some of the big things. Joe Biden has said, first\u00a0and foremost that he doesn't discuss business with his son and he never\u00a0has.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So what?\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 This is a guy who is running on character and judgment, he\u00a0should have to answer this question about whether or not he was honest.\u00a0Beside the question of whether or not he was actually debating going into\u00a0business with a Chinese company with ties to the government and military.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 We have photographs of Joe Biden with Hunter and Hunter's\u00a0clients, including a mogul from Kazakhstan. I mean, he brought Hunter with\u00a0him to China as Vice President and introduced him around.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, this has been chronicled over many years. It's not like we just\u00a0learned all of this, but the press is pretending like oh, it's not true.\u00a0The same people who wrote these stories five years ago are now pretending\u00a0they don't know what we are talking about.\u00a0\u00a0In one sentence, have you ever seen anything like this where the entire\u00a0American media decides to lie as a group about something?\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 No, you know, for two weeks, they told us prove it that it's\u00a0true. We just showed that it's true and now they say there's nothing there\u00a0to see.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It's -- yes, there are going to be huge ramifications, I would\u00a0say from this kind of behavior long term.\u00a0\u00a0Kim Strassel, thank you for your bravery on the story because you have been\u00a0brave, I think.\u00a0\u00a0STRASSEL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Amy Coney Barrett was just voted by the Senate to move to the\u00a0swearing in. So that's happening\u00a0tonight, 9:00 p.m. We're going to have\u00a0updates from the White House, from the Rose Garden in just a minute.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, experts raising new questions\u00a0tonight\u00a0about the coronavirus and where\u00a0it came from. There's a scientific consensus about that. But it turns out,\u00a0there are some pretty big holes in that consensus. Oh, they are not telling\u00a0you the truth again. Entirely possible.\u00a0\u00a0Alex Berenson after the break.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So we're almost a year into this pandemic. It was January when we\u00a0first reported on it. We still don't know exactly where it came from. We've\u00a0had a Chinese virologist, one of the first people to study the coronavirus\u00a0on this show twice. She says it was made in a lab and escaped. It was made\u00a0intentionally as a bio weapon.\u00a0\u00a0Now a biologist at M.I.T., Alina Chan is openly questioning the scientific\u00a0community's so-called consensus on where this came from. Chan wrote this\u00a0quote, \"The closest related virus genomes to the coronavirus cannot be\u00a0independently assembled due to missing data and unexplained\u00a0indiscrepancies.\"\u00a0\u00a0Chan also tweeted this quote, \"The public has little idea what happened/is\u00a0happening behind the scenes with journals and authors of coronavirus\u00a0papers.\" In other words, there is not really a consensus on where it came\u00a0from. Why don't we know? And is anyone working to find out honestly without\u00a0lying about it.\u00a0\u00a0Alex Berenson is one of the people who does not lie about this. He is the\u00a0author of \"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns Part 2,\" and\u00a0we're happy to have him on\u00a0tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Alex, I wish we had an hour for this topic. We don't because there's too\u00a0much going on. But just give us the state of the art on this question.\u00a0Where did this come from? What do we know? What don't we know?\u00a0\u00a0ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR:\u00a0 So very, very quickly, there's a lot we don't know.\u00a0And here's what we do know, anybody who raises this issue gets accused of\u00a0being a conspiracy theorist, and there are people in the scientific\u00a0community who are very deliberately conflating a couple of things.\u00a0\u00a0One is, is this a bio weapon? Okay, it's probably not a bio weapon,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0It wouldn't be a very good bio weapon because it didn't kill anybody who is\u00a0healthy. Okay.\u00a0\u00a0But the other question is, and I say anybody, obviously, there's always\u00a0exceptions. I have to throw that in or I'll get kicked at. The other\u00a0question is, could it have escaped from a lab? Probably a lab in China,\u00a0probably a lab in Wuhan where coronaviruses were being researched and where\u00a0scientists do what's called gain of function research.\u00a0\u00a0Gain of function research means that you manipulate the virus to try to\u00a0make it more virulent. That is the whole point of gain of function\u00a0research. The idea is, you're trying to figure out what natural virus might\u00a0become dangerous to humans if it mutated in various ways. And to do that,\u00a0and there's been a big argument about this in the scientific community for\u00a010 or 15 years, you either -- you either -- you often genetically modify\u00a0these viruses.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 You take bits of viruses, and you put them together, or you just\u00a0put various viruses in various animals and you wait for them to recombine.\u00a0Anyway, I know I don't have a lot of time. We don't know what happened\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0But we haven't found the animal host. We haven't found a virus in the wild\u00a0that's very, very much like SARS-CoV-2, and we have a giant lab that we\u00a0know had safety problems in China in 2018, in the same city where this\u00a0seemed to emerge from.\u00a0\u00a0This demands a real international investigation and it hasn't gotten one.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So maybe the obvious explanation is the correct one. I mean,\u00a0that's possible. Bottom line, it's possible,\u00a0\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 You know, that would be my prior, but you know, I'm just a\u00a0journalist. I'm not a scientist.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 You're much more honest than the scientists we have in charge,\u00a0I've noticed. Alex Berenson, thank you for that. Good to see you.\u00a0\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 Thanks. Thanks,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So Amy Coney Barrett's swearing in ceremony begins in just a few\u00a0minutes. The vote is in, in case you're just joining us, 52 to 48. She got\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to have coverage of it straight ahead.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 It seems like just yesterday we were wondering whether the\u00a0President would put forward a nominee before the election, he did of\u00a0course. And today, despite widespread expectations, he got her through. Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett, 52 to 48 was approved by the Senate. She is going to be\u00a0sworn in in the Rose Garden any moment.\u00a0\u00a0Shannon Bream is standing by for us right now. Hey, Shannon.\u00a0\u00a0SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hey,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0Well, yes, this first oath that she'll take will be administered by Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas. She knows him from her time clerking on the court for\u00a0Justice Scalia many years ago. Those two obviously were very close and she\u00a0will join in what now some people are speculating could become the Thomas\u00a0Court as he becomes really the influential conservative voice pulling\u00a0together potentially that wing. That's just the first oath.\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow she will undergo the second oath that will be administered by\u00a0Chief Justice John Roberts. Once that happens, she will officially be a\u00a0Justice -- Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\u00a0\u00a0There's a lot of work waiting for her. There have been a number of\u00a0emergency appeals to the court regarding ballot measures, voting, mail-in\u00a0voting, and that kind of thing. They'll have a conference on Friday where\u00a0they vote on taking up new cases.\u00a0\u00a0And then immediately when they start oral arguments again on Monday, she\u00a0faces a couple of really big cases that will test her as a brand new\u00a0Justice.\u00a0\u00a0But tomorrow, it'll be official. She'll get to work --\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 What an amazing night. Every night is an amazing night right now.\u00a0Shannon Bream., Thanks so much for that.\u00a0\u00a0BREAM:\u00a0 Good to see you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 As we told you, tomorrow night, the bulk of this show, a sit down\u00a0interview with Tony Bobulinski, the man who says he met with Joe Biden\u00a0about business in China. We're going to get details that have not been out\u00a0there before and they're being of course suppressed by the rest of the\u00a0media. That's tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, the White House event, the swearing in for Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0starts in just a moment.\u00a0\u00a0Sean Hannity takes over right now.\u00a0\u00a0Hey Sean.\u00a0\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

This is a rush transcript from \"Watters' World,\" August 29, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to \"Watters' World.\" I'm Jesse Watters. The RNC in review. That's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. The Republican Party and Donald Trump put on a very compelling case for re- election. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Speaking to you from an auditorium emptier than Joe Biden's daily schedule. HERSCHEL WALKER, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Growing up in the Deep South, I've seen racism up close. I know what it is and it isn't Donald Trump. MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS RESIDENT CHARGED FOR PROTECTING HIS HOME: Not a single person in the out of control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime. But you know was? We were. SEAN PARNELL, ARMY VETERAN: I see a party that wants to chain you to conformity and will destroy anyone they deem a heretic. NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first and he has earned four more years as President. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime, and that's why I believe the next American Century can be better than the last. MAXIMO ALVAREZ, CUBAN IMMIGRANT: I am so grateful to America, the place where I was able to build my American Dream through hard work and determination. DONALD TRUMP, JR., SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp. CRIS PETERSON, DAIRY FARMER: Our entire economy and dairy farming are once again roaring back. CISSIE GRAHAM LYNCH, DAUGHTER OF FRANKLIN GRAHAM: Some Democratic leaders tried to ban church services, while marijuana shops and abortion clinics were declared essential. BOB VLAISAVLJEVICH, MINNESOTA EX-DEMOCRATIC MAYOR: Biden is too weak, too scared and too sleepy to stand up to the radical left. ABBY JOHNSON, A PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST: A physician asked me to assess with an ultrasound guided abortion, nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen, and I'll never forget what the doctor said next, \"Beam me up, Scotty.\" NICHOLAS SANDMANN, COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL TEEN: The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode, canceled is what's happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left. Let's make America great again.

To this day, we never heard from Joe Biden. IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF DONALD TRUMP: Washington chooses sides, our President chooses commonsense. Where politicians choose party, our President chooses people. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: What do you think the difference was between the RNC and the DNC? It was that the RNC featured people over politicians. Farmers, loggers and veterans, steel workers, lobstermen and police officers. These were real Americans who were helped by Donald Trump's policies. Their authentic stories were relatable and easy to understand. The American worker was front and center. The American family was prioritized. Life, safety, peace and prosperity were showcased. And voters were shown a choice between life under Donald Trump and life under Joe Biden. Many speakers acted as character witnesses for President Trump. Donald Trump is a pretty tough guy. Behind the scenes, he is a very compassionate man who cares deeply about all Americans, no matter what their backgrounds. That was the message. The base was energized by a well-executed program highlighting a record of strong and smart foreign policy, a focus on law and order, and an America First economic philosophy. The Republican Party under Donald Trump made an effort to welcome all Americans, black Americans, Hispanic Americans and women, and those testimonials were powerful and persuasive and cut sharply against the nasty smears of the DNC Trump won hearts and minds this week, despite what the media will tell you, and here is the president in his own words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War. In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful, invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. So tonight, I ask you a simple question, how can the Democratic Party ask to lead our country, when it spends so much time tearing down our country? Joe Biden is not a savior of America's soul. He is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses -- and told them he felt their pain, and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China, and many other distant lands. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TRUMP: They're angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, America first. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TRUMP: Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it's a surrender to the virus. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. Joe Biden's agenda is Made in China. My agenda is Made in the U.S.A. Joe Biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radical -- then how is he ever going to stand up for you? Our American ancestors sailed across a perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism and delivered millions into freedom. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights and we will show that the world for America, there is a dream and it is not beyond your reach. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: That was an excellent speech by the President, even though it was a little long and went a little late. I can't stay up like I used to. The President has realigned the parties. Not your typical Republican. He wants to bring the troops home. He is pro-blue collar, criminal justice reformer. He is also pro-Second Amendment, pro-free speech and pro- religious freedom. It's a populist approach that eats into the Democratic Party, yet maintains the Republican Party base, allowing him to expand the map and compete in more states. The President linked Joe Biden to a repressive historical movement who demands power in exchange for redemption. He cast Joe Biden as a weakling who has betrayed the American worker, an incompetent lifelong politician who doesn't know what it means to put America first. Someone whose band of socialist crusaders will destroy the great American story. Biden's painful, unscientific shutdown won't defeat the virus. It'll only set us back. Now rhetorically, the President took Biden's Convention message and flipped it upside down, portraying Sleepy Joe as in the dark, someone who is hiding his radical policies and hiding in a dim basement; someone who will destroy the country in the dark of night just to gain power. You're seeing that now with riots and street violence. The Democrats doing everything they can to attack the foundation of civilization and safety. The President took a strong stand on maintaining law and order, something the Democrats totally ignored during their convention. The President honored, we, the People; reminded voters he is fighting for you, not Washington. This is a movement and he has reignited it this week. Lastly, the President finished with a beautiful flourish about American greatness. Trump raised the spirits of American history, the legends, the heroes and the renegades. The pioneers who pushed forward into the frontier and forged the nation unlike any other and he gathered that great energy and cast it out into the future, weaving together the great Americans story from the past, the present and into the future, making us feel a part of one unique and patriotic journey, together as one, reminding us all that the best is yet to come. WATTERS' WORLD predicts a close race. This is a divided country, but this week, the President catapulted himself to where it needs to be. He is expanding the map, growing the party and has permanently changed the dynamic of the race by taking action, defining Joe and demanding safety and providing a vision, which is this: splintering China to become a manufacturing superpower, waging a war on crime, tax relief and jobs, winning the race to 5G, reducing drug costs, cyber defense, keeping America out of endless wars, a vaccine and putting a man on Mars. Barring any October surprises, smart money is on four more years. Just look at the betting markets. See that trend in red? That's because of you. Much more still to come. Dan Bongino and I will break down the video of the police shooting in Wisconsin, as well as the shooting that left two dead during the riots that followed. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat finally called in the National Guard this week in the wake of deadly riots. Let's take a look at what started at all. Now the officers had responded to a domestic dispute by a woman who said her boyfriend was illegally on the premises. He had taken her keys and wasn't giving them back. The man's name is Jacob Blake. Police were alerted that he had an active warrant out for a sexual assault and when they arrived on the scene, they tried to take him into custody. Blake resisted and began assaulting the officer. The officer Tased him, but that didn't work. He escaped, opened his car door and reached for something. Now, one of the officers fired seven rounds of Blake as he was reaching into his car, those rounds hitting him in the back. The state waited several days to reveal that Blake had been reaching for a knife, but the riots had already raged. Blake is paralyzed. The Department of Justice is now involved. And two more people are dead as a result of the riots, which we'll discuss momentarily. Joining me now former police officer and Fox News contributor, Dan Bongino. All right, so Dan, these officers arrive on the scene. They know the guy has a warrant. They try to apprehend him. A scuffle ensues. He resists arrest. When he goes into the vehicle, he didn't go into the vehicle like he was opening the door to go get in and hit the gas. He was reaching for something down low. Now as a law enforcement officer, after you've been assaulted, and the suspect is then moving into the car and reaching for something down low, what is the calculation for discharging your weapon? DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this is the critical question, and the only question here from the officer's perspective, Jesse from both an administrative -- in other words, did he follow department guidelines for the application of use of force, potentially deadly use of force, thankfully the man survived in this case -- and legally in many cases when it comes to -- because those are two separate things, administrative guidelines and legal guidelines is going to be this. Did the officer who engaged with this firearm believe either his life or the life of others were at risk, or there was a risk of serious physical injury? Now, now that we have these additional facts, viewing it from that lens, the case becomes a little clearer. You know, in the social media era, it's kind of hip with some people, unfortunately, to put out an opinion on the case without actually knowing the case. You have a couple of things here, Jesse. You know, these are not civilians. These are police officers. Why does that matter? Because if it were you and I, God forbid, in a scuffle like this with another civilian that resulted in a tragic incident like this, you don't have the ability to check anyone's warrant. You're not a police officer. You don't have the history -- the background criminal history. This all plays out into the calculus, did the officer believe he was in fact in danger? He knows things a civilian doesn't. Combine that with the non-compliance, which is obvious. He had already been Tased -- the subject. He is not complying. There was a 911 call. This wasn't a random encounter. WATTERS: Right. BONGINO: And then there's an allegation that there was a weapon in the vehicle that could cause serious physical injury. And yes, you get a scenario where the facts start to become more clear why he may have felt that way, the officer. WATTERS: Right, and we do have information that the officers were aware of a felony weapons charge that this guy had been -- had to deal with. All right, so let's move on to the other story. So, this is worse because now two people are dead, not just paralyzed, and we just want to say, our thoughts and prayers to the Blake family, his children and everybody involved in that. This 17-year-old kid, Rittenhouse, white guy, admires police officers. He goes to the scene of Kenosha. There had been a few days of riots. Personally, in my opinion, Dan, he should never have been there. First of all, you can't even legally open carry in the State of Wisconsin, and you know, he doesn't own a business there. His family doesn't own a business. So sadly, he made a bad decision because the Governor made a bad decision by not protecting law and order. So he felt like he needed to step into the vacuum. We don't condone that. At one point, he is now being chased by an individual who had been taunting people earlier. The individual was throwing projectiles at his head and then he kind of turns as the individual lunges at him, and this guy's name Rosenbaum and he shoots him in the head, stands afterwards, calls someone on the phone and says, \"I've just shot someone\" before running away as a crowd descends. What did you see in that part of the video? BONGINO: Well, it's all going to be, of course again, he's going to have a different -- he is not a law enforcement officer. So, it's not going to be the same, obviously the same criteria that are going to go into evaluating whether he in fact broke the law. But the question still relevant, Jesse, is he going to be able to articulate through his attorney that he felt like his life was in fact threatened and he needed to engage with deadly force? By the way that's absent the carry question and what the local firearms law, it's a separate question. WATTERS: Right. BONGINO: Now, having said that, remember there were two incidents here on video -- WATTERS: Right, so let's get to the second incident. Let me set up the second incident. BONGINO: Yes, sure. WATTERS: So, he is running. At this point, some guy comes from behind and takes a swing at his head, hits him right there. He continues to run people are heard screaming, \"Get this guy. Get him.\" He trips, falls, one individual with a skateboard comes in, kind of tries to grab the weapon, hit him with a skateboard. Another guy comes in with a handgun, lunges, at one point, freezes. He discharges the weapon there. So one guy with the skateboard. His name is Anthony Hoover, shot in the chest. He has perished. And Gaige Grosskreutz with the handgun, he was shot in the arm. What did you see in that incident there? BONGINO: Well, the man with the handgun who approaches him, there's some up close video that's been out there making the rounds on social media, you can see it, it's kind of in that bubble right there we see in the screen. You know when you're approaching someone with a handgun like that in their face after an altercation before and the video on that one is a lot more descriptive than the video on the first one just given the distance it was taken from. You know, that case, he has an attorney, and I think Lin Woods representing him now, he probably has a good case there for self-defense in the second one. The first one video is not as descriptive. That's going to be a challenge on both sides. WATTERS: That is going to be a tough one. BONGINO: It doesn't tell us much. It's taken from a distance. And by the way, there's a scene behind cars, you can't really see as much. WATTERS: Right. So, the attorney for the defendant will argue self- defense, and just going back to the Blake situation, you know, this is another reason why you need body cameras. These body cameras they say they can't afford them in these police departments, but the costs I mean more than make up for it when things -- BONGINO: Can I make a quick point, Jesse. WATTERS: Sure. BONGINO: You know, we talk about law and order a lot. Order means process. What is process? Process means facts, and you're right, these body cameras protect police and the subjects of a police investigation. And you know, I think a lot of police officers who may have initially objected 10 years ago to that are starting to figure that out right now. These body cameras help everyone. WATTERS: Yes, maybe he made a threat, maybe he was going to take the kids' hostage. Those things are kind of swirling in the minds of the officer. Now, you don't know exactly what happened, and again, another tragedy unfolds -- a racial tragedy with police in America. Dan, thanks for your expertise. BONGINO: Thanks, Jesse. WATTERS: Rand Paul attacked leaving the Republican National Convention. Unbelievable situation. And Donald Trump accuses Joe Biden of taking drugs. Right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening and live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York. President Trump getting a firsthand look at the destruction along the Gulf Coast today after Laura made landfall Thursday as a Category Four Hurricane with winds higher than when Katrina made landfall exactly 15 years ago. The storm left over 800,000 without power in both Texas and Louisiana. Energy companies are just beginning to turn on the lights for residents there. And violence hitting St. Louis, Missouri just a few hours ago. Local police saying that two of their officers have been shot. Their condition is not known at this hour. As you can see police and SWAT teams are there on the scene right now. In a tweet, the St. Louis Police Department went on to say that the suspect is barricaded inside a nearby residence. They also urge all citizens to avoid the area. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now, back to WATTERS' WORLD. For all of your headlines, you can always log on to foxnews.com. You're watching the most powerful name of news, Fox News Channel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: The first night of the Republican Convention delivered a dark dystopian view of America should Donald Trump lose. WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: A very, very strong, very negative argument, very dark vision for America. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And presenting a dark picture of what a Biden-Harris victory would mean for the country. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: First night of the convention, it really took a dark turn. Don't you think? It was very ominous. JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The President and his team are issuing dark warnings about what will happen if Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Dark: the common theme from the media about this RNC this week. Does it sound familiar? Well, it should. We heard pretty much the same thing in 2016. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The first political campaign for the presidency where anger might be the prevalent motivation rather than optimism. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Others saw a lot of doom and gloom. MIKE MURPHY, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I just didn't know we're in Gotham City. You know, there are roving gangs and we need a billionaire vigilante. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The GOP nominee hammering home nationalist themes presenting the country as a dark place. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Joining me now to discuss is former White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders; and media reporter for \"The Hill,\" Joe Concha. All right, so Sarah, the Democratic National Convention said that Donald Trump was going to pile up black bodies and kill everybody with COVID, and he was going to put everybody in cages and prey on women, and kill Muslims. But the media said that was uplifting and optimistic. What is your understanding of the phrase dark? Why are they using the word \"dark\" in your opinion? SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Because the media as always wants to attack the President. The big difference that I saw between the Republican Convention and the Democratic Convention is that Republicans outlined a vision to build America up, while Democrats spent all of their time talking about tearing America down. I don't think anything could be further from the truth about the Republican Convention being dark. It was uplifting. It was empowering. It was inspiring. There were so many spectacular moments whether it was the testimonial video from the wife of David Dorn, Ann Dorn; whether it was a young congressional candidate, Madison, standing up on that stage. There were so many powerful moments, moving moments. I don't think anything could be further from the truth. I left feeling very good about where Republicans are, what we believe in and our path forward. Democrats were doom and gloom, and I think they should be very disappointed in the contrast between the two conventions. WATTERS: Well, I think you can tell that they're disappointed because they're freaking out. Joe, when the word \"dark\" is repeated by every single individual in the media, is that because of a memo goes out the night before that morning, because in most businesses, you try to distinguish yourself from the competition. But in the media, it's like a pack of wild dogs, like they work as a unit. Is that what's going on? JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: The hive mentality, right, Jesse, but by the way, if you in the dictionary, dark is the only adjective that is in there. So you know, they only have one word to work with, clearly. And when you juxtapose that with the way the DNC was covered, which was called optimistic and hopeful, the Biden camp, or Bette Midler couldn't write the headlines any better. So people watch this at home, and I'm not talking blind partisans, Jesse, but I'm talking about people who are just starting to pay attention to the election that may be on the fence and they say, how can we trust the media? Listen to these numbers that just came in from Gallup and the Knight Foundation. Eighty six percent of the American people believe that the media is biased. I'd love to have a bush light sometime with the 14 percent that don't believe it's biased. But here's the key number, 84 percent say the media bears the blame for political divide in this country. You say, oh, well, you know, maybe we never really trusted the media in the first place, you know, if you go back to the 70s. In 1976, more than seven in 10 Americans trusted the media. This number has been completely turned on its head. So then you go to influence. Is all of this coverage actually having an impact on polling? And an amazing thing happened after the DNC, Joe Biden got no polling down. Since 1968, the average bounce is five points. He got 0.0. So if you're in the Biden camp right now, to quote Scooby Doo, \"ruh roh.\" This is disturbing that you had all that overwhelmingly positive coverage, you got no bounce, and now Donald Trump from negative coverage will almost definitely get a bounce because of the production values and the presentation was that much better on the RNC side, which is ironic because the DNC had Hollywood on its side, and it still couldn't outperform the RNC obviously. WATTERS: Yes. I want to show you some video of Rand Paul, and this is when he was leaving the White House Convention. Roll the tape. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] WATTERS: So Sarah, were you there at the White House? Did you leave the same way Rand did or did you get choppered out of there like a VIP? SANDERS: Not quite choppered, but I didn't thankfully leave the same way Rand did. I think what we saw with Rand and his wife and several others who attended the President's speech last night is absolutely disgusting. One of the things I find so appalling about them shouting at Rand Paul is, \"Say her name, say her name.\" Rand Paul was the author of the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act. He has also been a champion for things like Criminal Justice Reform and other policies that empower black Americans. The hypocrisy of the left knows no bounds, and I think we saw that on full display last night as they attacked Senator Paul, and I commend him for staying strong, for helping and checking on the officer that was protecting him. And I hope that some of these people actually pay attention to the actions of the individuals they are shouting at because he has actually been somebody who has stood up not only said her name, but authored legislation asking for justice for her and I find the whole situation completely appalling and disgusting. WATTERS: So do I. You'd have to expect the protesters to know that about Rand Paul, but I don't think they're that well informed. I maybe just lay this at the doorstep of Maxine Waters, Joe, because she was calling for this, get in their faces, confront them wherever they are. And now you see this. Is the media condemning this type of behavior or not? CONCHA: What they should be doing Jesse, A, condemning and B, I want to hear from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, a former senator, a current senator in the situation with Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and I would ask Miss Harris, what would you do about the people that push police officers to try to hurt a sitting senator? And before you say, well, no one actually hurt Rand Paul in that situation? Yes. A couple of years ago, he was attacked in his own home and lost part of his lung. It had to be removed when he was attacked on his own lawn. So the bottom line is, at the DNC last week, riots were not broached even once ... WATTERS: He had his rib cracked. CONCHA: \u00a0... by the candidates or the dozens of the speakers that were there, Jesse. WATTERS: Right. And the media actually blamed Rand for mowing his lawn the wrong way. Unbelievable. All right, Sarah Sanders, Joe Concha. Thank you guys. SANDERS: You bet. Thanks, Jesse. CONCHA: Thanks, Jesse. WATTERS: Will Joe Biden debate Donald Trump? And is Joe Biden taking drugs? Well, the President thinks so. Also, many young stars at this week's RNC One of them will be here. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: The dust has barely settled on the conventions and the Democrats are already monkeying around with the debates. Nancy Pelosi says Biden shouldn't even debate the President. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't think that there should be any debates. I do not think that the President of the United States has comported himself in a way that anybody has any association with truth, evidence, data and facts. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Oh, and it gets better. Hillary Clinton says Biden shouldn't even concede the election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out, and eventually, I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: So the Democratic strategy is basically stay in the basement, don't debate and don't concede the election. Joining me now, Trump 2020 senior adviser, Jason Miller. All right, Jason, here's what I think is going on here. Crooked is saying that Biden is going to win if you just drag this thing out and sue and recount long enough like Florida in 2000 or they're just setting it up so they can delegitimize Trump's second term. And then Nancy is basically admitting that in the highest echelons of the Democratic establishment, they don't think it's a good idea for Joe to debate, that they think that Trump will win, or that Biden will blow it, and that they could actually get away with ducking because the media would let him slide. How do you see it? JASON MILLER, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Well, exactly, I mean, the Democrats don't want to put Joe Biden up against President Trump, but I got a comment in the intro package, Jesse when Crooked was there with a glorious new shade of magenta, maybe we can call it like a crooked magenta you know, for Crayola. They can have a new crayon in the box, a special crooked color. But here's the deal, Joe Biden is actually a pretty good debater. We just had 47 years of practice on this. He was actually pretty good. I've been going back and watched all those debates from 1987, 2007, 2008, 2012, and then now and I think a lot of it is just muscle memory. He has had all this time in the basement to go and practice, get his lines down. But here's what I think the Democrats will probably do. They probably will out Joe Biden to do one debate and then I think they cut loose and say, you know what, we don't want to give President Trump any oxygen, any opportunity to go head-to-head with them ever again. But it's -- look, whether it be the universal vote by mail, the ballot harvesting, whether it be trying to duck out of the debates, whether it be accusing President Trump anything else, I just think the Democrats are going to look to lie, cheat and steal every step of this election. WATTERS: Yes, they're squirrely, and they're telegraphing the whole situation. Now, the President has done something the way he usually does, is he has kind of thrown a little cloud of smoke into this whole debate thing and he has accused Joe Biden of maybe taking performance enhancing drugs. Let's listen to this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) TRUMP: I don't know how he could have been so incompetent in his debate performances, and then all of a sudden, be okay against Bernie. If go back and watch some of those numerous debates, he was so bad. He wasn't even coherent. And against Bernie he was. And we're calling for a drug test. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: So Jason, have you guys contacted the Debate Commission and asked for drug testing? MILLER: You know what, maybe on Monday, there'll be a letter that we get out the door. But on a serious note, I do think President Trump is onto something here and the fact that Joe Biden's regular day-to-day interviews, he bumbles and he stumbles, and you wonder if he is going to say something like 150 million people have been killed by gun violence or 120 million people have died from coronavirus. I mean, Joe Biden just is a gaffe a minute or, of course, the infamous you ain't black, which was another one of the buttes coming from Joe Biden there. But when he gets into that debate stage, whether it's they program him or it's the muscle memory for having been doing it for a half century, he can go and give a pretty good answer, and he has been doing it pretty consistently for about a half century. But I know that the President takes an aspirin a day. But, you know, if we rattle Joe Biden's cage a little bit, we'll see what's juicing him up. WATTERS: All right. Well, we don't know whether he is going to use Mini Mike's little box to stand on. I think we're still investigating that. Jason, thank you very much. MILLER: Thanks, Jesse. WATTERS: A rising star from the Republican National Convention is about to enter WATTERS' WORLD, who will it be? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: A lot of young guns have made big names for themselves at conventions. Remember Barack Obama's keynote speech in 2004? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: This week, a list of rising Republican stars left a very big impression. CAMERON: Mr. Vice President, look at me, I am black. We are not all the same, sir. I am not in chains. SANDMANN: Let's make America great again. CAWTHORN: Be radical for liberty and be radical for our Republic for which I stand, one nation under God with liberty and justice for all. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And one of them joins me now. Drumroll please. North Carolina congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn. All right, Madison, I hope you don't think I was comparing you to Barack Obama, only in the sense that you could really springboard your political career from having a great convention moment, and you did. So tell us what you meant when you stood up like that, and said, \"Be a radical.\" CAWTHORN: Well, you know what, I wanted to redefine this word \"radical.\" I mean, you know, the ideas that my ancestors fought and died for about 244 years ago for the Revolutionary War are very radical now. If you have traditional values, and you believe in the America that is great, the America that is the most prosperous nation in the world, then I think that right now in mainstream culture, you are radical, and I really want us to embrace that. I want us to move forward boldly and not be afraid to back down to the mob because we're radicals for freedom. WATTERS: So that was a big moment that everybody was very inspired by, thank you for doing that. What was some of the reaction that you've gotten from that moment when you stood? CAWTHORN: You know, the reaction is exactly what I wanted to receive. You know, the reason I brought out both two of my friends and also people on my staff to help me get to my feet is because I wanted to show that here in America, we help each other up. Here in America, you know, we are banded together. The reason we use three of us is because, you know, it's representative of the three branches of government and they all work together symbiotically, and when we all work together, we can raise this nation to heights that we've never even thought possible before. WATTERS: All right, Madison Cawthorn, got a big race coming up. Good luck out there. CAWTHORN: Thanks, Jesse. WATTERS: Coronavirus kept us from going to this year's Convention, sadly, so we're taking a trip down memory lane with a last call flashback. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: The China virus changed a lot of things this year. I couldn't go to the conventions to do the WATTERS' WORLD that you know and love. But it might not have even mattered that much because I have a feeling that 2020 would have sounded a lot like 2016. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Can you name one piece of Bernie Sanders legislation that passed in the Senate? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. Not at the moment. But if you'll just give me a second. GROUP: [Bleep] you. TERRY MCAULIFFE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: We are not building a wall. That wall is a joke. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The economy is not that great. I'll give you guys that one. We have some work to do. WATTERS: I thought the Obama economy was strong. Do you support sanctuary cities? GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Immigration is a Federal responsibility. REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): I don't trust the details coming from Fox News. WATTERS: That's offensive, Congresswoman. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am here to awaken humanity. WATTERS: Do you think climate change or illegal immigration is a bigger threat? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Climate change. WATTERS: Why do you say that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because we can't eat money, you know. Can't eat money, my friend. WATTERS: That makes perfect sense. Do you know who I am? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're handsome. GROUP: We don't need that. GROUP: Black Lives Matter. WATTERS: What are you protesting today? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am here protesting Donald Trump, becoming President. QUESTION: What are you out here protesting today? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are out here protesting Trump and the general Republican platform. WATTERS: Does my life matter? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, all lives matter. WATTERS: Oh, you can't say that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, all lives matter. I could say that. WATTERS: You can't say that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, all lives matter. Even police lives matter. WATTERS: Even Trump's life matter? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Even Trump's life matter. WATTERS: Are you worried about Trump as President? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I am. WATTERS: Tell me why? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because he is straight evil. WATTERS: Do you have a problem with capitalism? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I do. WATTERS: What do you want to replace capitalism with? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Socialism. WATTERS: Do you know who I am? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are a child of God. WATTERS: I'm Watters. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And this is your world. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: A lot shorter hair. That's all for tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" is next and remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.

            "article_content": "Fox News obtains two emails allegedly linking Hunter Biden to Chinese firm; Former federal prosecutor Brett Tolman on the emails being uncovered. Hunter Biden\u2019s emails and texts\u00a0show not just a politician\u2019s troubled son angling for lucrative overseas business deals \u2014 they also reveal a concerned father, a fun-loving friend and a man tortured by the deaths that have devastated his family. In a text-message exchange from 2018, eldest daughter Naomi \u2014 named after Biden\u2019s late sister, who was killed with their mother, Neilia, in a 1972 car crash \u2014 pleaded with her dad for emergency cash. \u201cCan you put 150 in my account it was just declined for lyft to airport sorry sorry sorry,\u201d the now-26-year-old Columbia Law student asked. \u201cYes I can but Naomi you \u00adreally have to start to realize that once you are out of school the chances of you living like your father is a billionaire when he\u2019s really given all his money away- is going to be a bit of a shock,\u201d Hunter answered. \u201cI know I promise ill be much better this year!!!!!!!!!!! Promise,\u201d Naomi wrote back. Naomi didn\u2019t return a request for comment, but neither Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer nor Joe Biden\u2019s campaign have\u00a0disputed the validity of the trove of data\u00a0that The Post obtained after being extracted from a MacBook Pro laptop. The owner of a Delaware computer-repair shop said the machine was dropped off in April 2019 but never retrieved. A computer camera roll of nearly 25,000 images is loaded with sexually explicit selfies and porn (which The Post is not publishing), but also has snapshots from Biden\u2019s childhood and vacations. CLICK HERE TO SEE\u00a0PHOTOS IN THE NEW YORK POST President Trump's personal attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, argues Hunter Biden\u2019s hard drive contains \u2018confidential information.' And while some of the more than 11,550 emails involve Biden\u2019s former job on the board of the\u00a0Ukrainian energy company Burisma\u00a0and\u00a0his dealings with the now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co., most of his messages are innocuous and personal in nature. A 2019 text exchange shows Biden corresponding with a pal, Mehall Ledwith, who was celebrating St. Patrick\u2019s Day at The Chelsea Bell bar in Manhattan. \u201cThat sounds like fun. Where dat,\u201d Biden wrote. Another exchange, from 2018, shows Biden inviting a friend to The Hollywood Roosevelt hotel in LA, saying he has a \u201ccabana suite\u201d and is \u201cpartying like an idiot ass rock star.\u201d \u201cHaha sounds ridiculously fun then. I can maybe try to come later,\u201d Andrew Boshop wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll make your night dude,\u201d Biden replied. Ledwith said he didn\u2019t recall the St. Patrick\u2019s Day exchange but said he and Biden were friends who have communicated by text. Boshop didn\u2019t return a request for comment. TWITTER ANNOUNCES NEW POLICIES AFTER CONTROVERSIAL HANDLING OF HUNTER BIDEN REPORT Biden \u2014\u00a0who has acknowledged struggling with drug and alcohol problems\u00a0\u2014 also poured his heart out in a lengthy email that he sent to himself in 2015, about three weeks after his brother, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, died of brain cancer. In the nearly-800-word missive, which is filled with misspellings, Biden recounts going to church as a child with his father and brother on \u201cevery Sunday growing up\u201d \u2014 as well as the Mass he attended the day following Beau\u2019s death. \u201cI missed his touch \u2013 I could feel him there in our [midst] I could smell him-but he wasn\u2019t there he was gone,\u201d Biden wrote.

            "article_content": "'Fox News @ Night' host Shannon Bream and George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley weigh in. \"Brilliant.\" \"Forthright.\" \"Intellectual giant.\" Those were some of the words used to describe Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Senate Judiciary Committee. by witnesses from the American Bar Association (ABA)\u00a0and Barrett allies. Meanwhile, Democrat witnesses portrayed the 7th Circuit Judge and former professor as a threat to health care, abortion and\u00a0voting rights. The laudatory explanation from the ABA Standing Committee of its \"Well Qualified\" rating for Barrett Thursday marked the start of a hearing that was delayed by procedural tactics by Democrats aimed at delaying the Barrett nomination during the committee's morning business meeting. They came before a panel of witnesses both for and against Barrett alternatively praised her as a judicial \"five-tool athlete,\" or a threat to cause \"real-world harm.\" \"She's a brilliant thinker. She analyzes and writes about legal issues with striking clarity and precision. She is patient, thoughtful and compassionate. She brings each of these qualities to bear on every case she decides,\"\u00a0Amanda Rauh-Bieri, one of Barrett's former law clerks said. \"She's committed above all else to the rule of law ... Judge Barrett understands that policy decisions must be left to the political branches, the role of a judge is to enforce the law as written.\" SENATORS CLASH AT BARRETT CONFIRMATION HEARING AS DEMS ATTEMPT PROCEDURAL ROADBLOCKS, GOP FORGES AHEAD Republicans touted the ABA experts'\u00a0comments from the independent group as boosting their case that Barrett should be on the Supreme Court. \"The standing committee concluded that Judge Barrett's integrity, judicial temperament, professional competence, met the very high standards for appointment to our Supreme Court,\" Randall D. Noel of the ABA Standing Committee said. \"Our rating of 'Well Qualified' reflects the consensus of her peers that know her best.\" BARRETT ON TRACK AS SENTE PANEL BRINGS IN EXPERTS FOR FINAL DAY OF SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS Pamela J. Roberts described the process the committee went through to come up with its rating for Barrett. She also reported a number of descriptions of Barrett from her peers. Those included: \"good, decent, selfless and sincere,\" \"always willing to be helpful,\" \"good listener,\" \"never a hint of sarcasm in her questioning,\" \"highly productive, punctual and well-prepared,\" and, from a professor, \"without question the smartest student I've ever taught.\" Barrett has an \"excellent reputation for integrity and outstanding character. Judges and lawyers alike uniformly extolled the nominee's integrity,\" Roberts said. The committee then heard from eight other witnesses who have either worked with or known Barrett and laud her qualifications for the court, or who believe that Barrett poses a grave threat to their rights. \"A vote for Judge Barrett is a vote to take away health care,\"\u00a0Stacy Staggs, a mother of twins who have preexisting conditions that she says she can afford to treat because of the ACA, said. \"Our country is in a public crisis right now ... in this moment we need our legislators to ... do the job we elected them to do. We do not need to rush through the nomination of a Supreme Court justice who is on the record as hostile to the law that provides our health care.\" Added\u00a0Dr. Farhan Bhatti, the CEO and Medical Director of Care Free Medical: \"As a doctor ... I can talk about the real-world harm of ending the ACA ... as a physician ... any judge who opposes the ACA endangers a lifeline that my patients count on to stay healthy.\" Kristen Clarke, another Democrat witness and the president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, warned about the fact that Barrett would not explicitly say she would recuse herself from election-related cases. \"These are voters who want their ballots and not an election season court pick to determine an election outcome,\" Clarke said. And warning about Barrett's past stances on abortion,\u00a0Crystal Good, a woman who had an abortion at 16 years-old, said that she may be a vote to allow states to regulate abortion. \"I still think what might have happened,\" if she didn't have an abortion, Good said. \"Access to abortion should not depend on the luck of the draw ... who your governor is or who is sitting on the Supreme Court.\" Meanwhile, Republican witnesses recalled their personal experience with Barrett and said she is fully qualified to be on the Supreme Court. She's \"brilliant, she's a tremendous educator, she's an institutionalist, she's a role model and I'll say finally she's an originalist, and I think that's a good thing,\"\u00a0University of Virginia School of Law\u00a0Professor Saikrishna Prakash said. Prakash clerked for D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge\u00a0Laurence Silberman, who Barrett also clerked for. Originalism became a flashpoint in the hearing, with Democrat senators making the case that the judicial philosophy held by late Justice Antonin Scalia -- as well as current Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch -- is a reason to keep Barrett off the bench. \"You asked a gay black woman if she's an originalist? No, ma'am, I'm not,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., quoted\u00a0Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a lawyer herself, as saying.\u00a0\"That Constitution didn't consider me a person in any way, shape or form because I'm a woman, because I'm black and because I'm gay.\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., later called originalism a \"smokescreen\" for \"activist\" judges, specifically pointing to the dissent Barrett wrote in the case Kanter v. Barr arguing that governments should not be able to take away someone's Second Amendment rights just because they are convicted of a nonviolent felony. But\u00a0D.C. Circuit Court Judge Thomas Griffith, who supports Barrett, defended originalism, saying that the philosophy -- the interpretation of laws and the Constitution as they were publicly understood at the time they were written -- prevents judges from substituting their own views in rulings. \"The American people decide what is fair and just and equitable,\" through the laws their representatives\u00a0pass, Griffith said. \"I was not appointed to take my own views ... and use them to resolve the case... our job as a judge is to be a faithful agent to We\u00a0the People as they express their will through law.\" Griffith in his opening statement also addressed some of the hate that has been directed to Barrett largely from leftists outside of Congress over her religion and previous pro-life stances. \"While some of the discussion about Judge Barrett's faith has been tinged with bigotry, some of it comes from a sincere desire to know whether her faith will take your decisions\u00a0as a justice,\" Griffith said.\u00a0\"As a person of faith who served on the D.C. Circuit, let me assure you it would not.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The oath that every federal judge must take is intended to transform the citizen into an impartial judge whose loyalty, while performing her judicial role, is to the Constitution and laws in the United States and not to any president, party or religion,\" Griffith continued. \"In other words, her personal faith --\u00a0the judicial oath is a promise to the nation and God that she will not do the one thing her secular critics must fear:\u00a0Reach for outcomes based on her religious worldview.\" Laura Wolk, who was the first blind woman to serve as a clerk on the Supreme Court, recalled a time as a student of\u00a0the then-Notre Dame Law School professor when Barrett helped her get the assistive technology she needed to do her classwork. \"Judge Barrett will serve this country with distinction not only because of her intellectual prowess but because of her ability to treat everyone as an equal deserving of complete respect,\" Wolk said. Thursday will be the final day of the Barrett hearings before the Judiciary Committee votes on her nomination Oct. 22 and the full Senate likely the following week.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. EXCLUSIVE: A\u00a0voter filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater\u00a0and other officials, claiming that in at least 16 counties voter rolls have not been properly maintained and that this leaves them vulnerable to fraud in November's election. Tony Daunt, a Republican active in his state and county parties, alleges that the Michigan voter registration rates in these counties are \u201csuspiciously high\u201d because their voting records have not been cleaned out to remove ineligible voters, including those who have died, moved, or been convicted of felonies. MICHIGAN POLICE CHIEF ON LEAVE AFTER POSTS ABOUT 'BODY BAGS' FOR PROTESTERS \u201cRetaining voter rolls bloated with ineligible voters harms the electoral process, heightens the risk of electoral fraud, and undermines public confidence in elections,\u201d says Daunt\u2019s complaint, which was filed in federal court in the Western District of Michigan. The lawsuit cited data compiled by the Honest Elections Project, which includes information from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014-18 American Community Survey and the latest count of registered voters from Benson\u2019s office. In one county, the number of registered voters actually exceeded the number of people of voting age. \u201cComparing the registered voter count to the 2014-18 American Community Survey reveals that Leelanau County has a registration rate of 102%,\u201d the complaint says. In 15 other counties mentioned in the lawsuit, that percentage is above 90 percent. PRO-BIDEN PAC AIMS TO WEAKEN TRUMP WITH SENIORS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS Daunt claims that a failure to remove ineligible names from the voter rolls could result in voter fraud, even a small amount of which could impact close elections. In 2016, President Trump won Michigan by just 0.4 percent. The lawsuit asserts that the state has an obligation to resolve this issue under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). The NVRA allows individuals to notify state officials of voter registration record problems, and to sue them if reasonable action is not taken within 90 days. Daunt sent a letter through attorney William Consovoy \u2013 who has represented Trump\u00a0in a number of matters -- to Benson and Brater in February and claims that they have\u00a0not taken appropriate measures to maintain accurate records. \u201cDefendants\u2019 failure to maintain accurate voter rolls violates federal law and jeopardizes the integrity of the upcoming 2020 election,\u201d the complaint says. Fox News reached out to the secretary of state\u2019s office for comment, but they did not immediately respond. While Daunt is looking for Michigan to remove names from voter rolls, its practice has also led to intense controversy and legal battles in numerous states. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0says cleaning up voter rolls can be a responsible exercise, but some states have used it as \u201ca method of mass disenfranchisement, purging eligible voters from rolls for illegitimate reasons or based on inaccurate data, and often without adequate notice to the voters.\u201d In February, a\u00a0Wisconsin court of appeals overturned an order to remove\u00a0up to 209,000 people fro state voter rolls, as Democrats argued the purge\u00a0was intended to make it more difficult for their voters to cast ballots in November.

            "article_content": "From Sen. Kamala Harris to Susan Rice, Washington Examiner political reporter Emily Larsen breaks down the potential picks. Joe Biden is dithering. He was supposed to tap his running mate the first week of\u00a0August, but\u00a0has now postponed the announcement to Aug. 10. It\u2019s the first consequential decision of his campaign, one that could determine whether he wins or loses in November, and he\u2019s blowing it. The extension, and the ongoing uncertainty\u00a0it suggests,\u00a0casts\u00a0Biden\u00a0as\u00a0wobbly. It also\u00a0reduces any zip that the eventual announcement might have.\u00a0It\u2019s not\u00a0a\u00a0great\u00a0beginning\u00a0for a candidate constantly\u00a0tweeting that\u00a0the country needs \u201cstrong leadership.\u201d NEWT GINGRICH: 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\u00a0\u2014 SEAN HANNITY AND I AGREE: AMERICA IS ON THE BRINK Granted,\u00a0that\u2019s a lot to read from\u00a0a one-week delay. But, after all, we don\u2019t know much about Biden 2020\u2019s governing style\u00a0or how he makes decisions.\u00a0He has held but\u00a0few give-and-takes with the press in recent months \u2013 most notably declining to be interviewed by the New York Times or Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace,\u00a0or anyone else who\u00a0might actually ask some tough questions. Here\u2019s what we do know:\u00a0 almost certainly Biden will pick a woman of color; he has no choice. He owes his nomination to black voters, and they have demanded a seat at the table. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The short list of potential running mates now includes Sen. Kamala Harris, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, California Rep. Karen Bass, who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, Florida Rep. Val\u00a0Demings\u00a0and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Biden's list of vice president contenders includes (from left) Sen. Kamala Harris, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Rep. Karen Bass, Rep. Val Demings, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms While all five of these women have impressive bios, all have serious shortcomings and none can possibly perform the heavy lifting that this role will require. The first and most important job of Biden\u2019s VP pick will be to boost turnout on Nov. 3. No presidential candidate has engendered less excitement among members of his own party than Biden; he desperately needs his VP pick to provide some sizzle. True, he leads currently in the polls. But in reviewing their recent polling, CBS reported that, \u201cWhile most Trump supporters say they're mainly voting for him because they like him, about half of Biden voters say opposition to Mr. Trump is driving their vote.\u201d Hatred is not a reliable underpinning of a campaign. The groups least enchanted with their party\u2019s nominee\u00a0are\u00a0young blacks\u00a0and progressives. Recent polling indicates some 91 percent of blacks age 65 and older will vote for Biden, while only 68 percent between the ages of 18 and 29 will support him. Progressives, too, are tepid on Biden. In a Suffolk University/USA Today poll conducted in April, 14 percent of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters said they would not vote for Biden. Remember that in 2016 some 12 percent of Sanders\u2019 backers broke for Trump, helping to put him in the Oval Office. The former VP is going all out to win over those folks, combining forces with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren to roll out a series of radical economic and environmental plans that explode the myth that Biden is a \u201cmoderate.\u201d The ultimate paean, however, would\u00a0be to nominate one of their own, something Biden is probably loathe to do. Second, Biden\u2019s VP candidate must appear ready to be commander in chief. Because 55 percent of voters think 77-year-old Biden is in the early stages of dementia, many will expect that, if elected, he will not serve out his full term. At the least, he would be a one-term president, meaning that his VP would be the probable candidate running in 2024. That raises the stakes, big time. Because 55 percent of voters think 77-year-old Biden is in the early stages of dementia, many will expect that, if elected, he will not serve out his full term. Karen Bass\u00a0is the only progressive on the short list. She\u00a0appears to have the blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0and is considered a \u201csafe\u201d pick in that she does not appear to be aggressively running to be president and would be a loyal sidekick. But,\u00a0she has zero name recognition; Politico describes her as\u00a0having \u201cone\u00a0of the lowest public profiles among the top contenders.\u201d\u202fAlso, she has worked across the aisle over the years, which is viewed with skepticism these days by the\u00a0angry Left. She is low\u00a0key and has had little experience with national campaigning. Lastly, as a young liberal, she volunteered to work in Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba, and afterwards made favorable comments about the regime. That doesn\u2019t play well, especially in the key state of Florida. Sanders got into scalding hot water for commenting that \u201cit\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad\u201d about Castro\u2019s government. As one Democrat Florida-based pollster noted: \u201cKaren Bass\u2019s history on this subject makes Bernie Sanders look like Ronald Reagan.\u201d Val\u00a0Demings\u00a0would be a plus, helping Biden carry Florida,\u00a0and\u00a0Keisha Lance\u00a0Bottoms could help win Georgia, but both have backgrounds in law enforcement, which is problematic\u00a0in today\u2019s Democrat Party, and especially among young blacks and progressives. Demings\u00a0is a former cop, and Bottoms was a prosecutor in Atlanta before becoming a judge, and\u00a0finally becoming mayor.\u00a0Both have faded from the limelight\u00a0in recent weeks as Democrats have become increasingly hostile to the police. That leaves Susan Rice, who is considered by odds-makers the probable runner-up, and Kamala Harris, who is leading the pack. Both women carry significant baggage. Rice has no campaign chops and is tied forever to the Benghazi scandal and other Obama-era controversies, including the \u201cunmasking\u201d of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. Republicans would tear her to shreds. Even the Washington Post\u2019s liberal Dana Milbank is skeptical of the famously unpleasant Rice, quoting her description of Sen. Lindsey Graham as a \u201cpiece of\u00a0sh**\u201d in a recent column and\u00a0asking\u00a0\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the vice president of the United States?\u201d Kamala Harris is controversial as well. She, too, was a former prosecutor, and was attacked by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard during the debates for having \u201cput over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.\u201d That doesn\u2019t play well with today\u2019s Democrats.

            "article_content": "Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ... Trump or Biden? America heads to the polls -- wondering when final result will be knownVoters will cast their ballots nationwide Tuesday to choose whether the next president of the United States will be Donald Trump or Joe Biden, even as tens of millions have already voted either early or through the mail. By the time the polls close, a presidential election cycle that began more than three years ago -- in July 2017 when former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland declared he was running for the Democratic nomination -- will draw to a close as well. But in 2020, many states, including key swing states, may count their votes more slowly than during typical years. There are also cases -- such as in Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- where elections boards will count ballots that are mailed on or before Election Day but are received days later. Pennsylvania will accept ballots for up to three days after Election Day and North Carolina will accept ballots for nine days. States that take longer to count their mail votes are likely to see vote counts that favor Trump early on Tuesday night as in-person totals come in and then a swing toward Biden later in the evening and potentially in the following days.\u00a0CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.

He said Democrats were \"waging war on our police\" as a \"Back the blue!\" chant broke out among the crowd.

I'm telling you that right now.\" Earlier in the day, Trump warned a crowd in Pennsylvania that Biden posed a threat to the state's energy industry. \"A vote for Biden will be a vote to ban fracking, outlaw mining, explode energy costs and destroy Pennsylvania,\" the president said.\u00a0CLICK HERE FOR MORE.In other developments:- Trump rallies supporters in North Carolina amid final sprint before Election Day- Trump says Supreme Court decision on Pennsylvania ballots is 'dangerous,' 'will 'induce violence'- Pro-Trump boaters hold final San Diego Bay parade before Election Day- 2020 presidential election ballots cast so farStars rally behind Biden, but Trump matches celebrity cash thanks to one showbiz leaderDemocrat Joe Biden's record-breaking fundraising haul was aided by broad support from celebrities who have poured at least $13.1 million into boosting his White House bid.

In comparison, roughly 525 people in the entertainment world donated money to help reelect President Trump, the donor data through Oct. 14 shows.

            "article_content": "The Hill media reporter Joe Concha reacts to ABC &amp; NBC's town halls and Steve Scully admitting he was not hacked. The dueling \u201ctown hall\u201d events on ABC and NBC on Thursday night featuring the two 2020 presidential candidates, former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden and President Trump,\u00a0once again underlined that whatever romantic attachment voters have to the \u201ctown hall\u201d concept on television is no longer warranted. These network events are heavily pre-screened, pre-scripted, and pre....dictable. And whenever they are exposed for making \u201cmistakes,\u201d it's always a mistake in favor of Biden. In a real town hall, people get up in somewhat random order and just unfurl what\u2019s on their mind. The networks think the stakes are far too high to walk that tightrope, especially in an age where social-media troublemakers can take anything viral, and the entire Democratic establishment is petrified Joe Biden could spontaneously combust in a horrible gaffe. As FoxNews.com has reported, two of ABC\u2019s Biden questioners had ties to Democrats. One was a speechwriter in the Obama administration. The other, presented as a physical therapist, was the wife of a high-profile Pennsylvania Democrat. BIDEN'S ABC TOWN HALL QUESTIONERS INCLUDE FORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER, WIFE OF FORMER PENNSYLVANIA DEM CANDIDATE How hard is it for the networks to do some elementary Google searches before choosing their questioners? Or are these choices carefully planned and they hide these partisan identities hoping their \u201cmistake\u201d won\u2019t be discovered? This also happened at ABC's town hall for Donald Trump. Kutztown University professor Ellesia Blaque, a woman ABC repeatedly identified as \"uncommitted\" in its coverage of the town hall, complained at length about the need for ObamaCare. The Washington Free Beacon found that on social media, she praised vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris during the primaries saying she would \"be there, volunteering\" for the California senator in Pennsylvania. TRUMP DEBATES MODERATOR WHILE BIDEN GETS COVER FROM MAINSTREAM MEDIA: JOE CONCHA The English professor was not shy about her loathing of the president, calling Trump a \"f\u2014ing moron,\" \"pathetic,\" \"pig,\" \"swine,\" and \"punk ass.\" But after the ABC event, CNN's Brian Stelter extended the charade by quoting \"undecided\" Professor Blaque claiming Trump had powerfully \"reanimated\" her into voting for Biden. At NBC\u2019s Biden \u201ctown hall\u201d on October 5, I quickly discovered several of the so-called \u201cindependent voters\u201d Lester Holt was touting could be identified as Biden supporters by just searching their names and towns. TIM GRAHAM: NBC TOWN HALL TOSSES BIDEN SOFTBALL QUESTIONS FROM HIS FANS Their overtly pro-Biden or pro-abortion questions also made you scoff at the idea they were undecided. If the networks see these questions beforehand, they're not even trying to make them sound more \"undecided.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER After the debate, Ingrid Gilliam-Alexander posted her appearance on her LinkedIn page the hashtag \u201c#joebiden2020.\u201d Cassidy Brown posted \u201cVote Pro-Choice\u201d memes on her Facebook page. Michelle Cruz Marrero was easily found on the Facebook page \u201cCubanos con Biden\u201d gushing that \u201cBiden was eloquent...He is intelligent. He is elegant. He is poised and he has a plan....We need Biden....He will save America and he will restore the country we had before this monster took over.\u201d Worse yet, the Washington Free Beacon found two of the male \u201cundecided voters\u201d had appeared on MSNBC a few months ago, identified on-screen as Biden supporters! So when NBC booked Trump for their town hall on Thursday, producers dropped the word \u201cundecided\u201d from the menu.\u00a0 But the voters almost vanished from the picture. There was so much outrage inside the walls of NBC that moderator Savannah Guthrie took over the event. As someone complained to me on Twitter, \"This wasn't a town hall. It was a hostile interview with spectators that were periodically allowed to chime in.\" Hill media reporter Joe Concha says that his review of the transcript showed Guthrie asked President Trump 43 questions, and the voters were only granted ten. He noted this did not count her many interruptions to just make statements, like yelling at him \"you're the president, you're not someone's crazy uncle!\" In this case, none of these sparsely used voters were easily exposed as something other than how they were presented by NBC. Ever since the Commission on Presidential Debates started using a \"town hall\" format in 1992, we at the Media Research Center have found the networks have almost uniformly tilted the debates in favor of questioners who supported the Democrats and the liberal agenda. The only exception was 2008, when ABC's Charles Gibson managed to balance it at eight and eight. Even if there had been a \"town hall\" debate with both Trump and Biden present, it's quite likely that it would be another loaded event against the Republicans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In other words, it's just as biased as a normal debate with a \"mainstream media\" moderator, but it carries that annoying illusion that it's offering viewers a random assortment of voters with their random thoughts about politics.

Forget everything you\u2019ve heard from the media about this election. Forget the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of TV ads. Forget what the candidates have said and forget what the pundits have predicted. Think about your family. I was governor of Florida for eight years. I spent every day thinking about what I could do to improve the lives of every family in my state. I grew up poor. We lived in public housing when I was a kid. I remember when my dad\u2019s car got repossessed. I remember my mom traveling four hours to get to a hospital to help treat my brother\u2019s medical condition. DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS I thought about families like mine growing up and focused on getting results for them. We supported our law enforcement and reached a 47-year low in our crime rate. We created nearly 1.7 million jobs over eight years. We cut taxes nearly 100 times, putting more than $10 billion back in the pockets of hard-working Floridians. We paid down one-third of state debt to reduce the burden on future generations. And our pro-growth policies allowed us to invest record funding in education, environmental protection and transportation. Now think about the choice you have on Tuesday \u2013 a choice that will decide the future of our country. JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT \u2014 HERE\u2019S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION Donald Trump supports our law enforcement and has made great progress to secure the border. He believes in the rule of law. Donald Trump believes in capitalism which creates opportunity for every American to live their dream. He believes in free-market solutions to address health care needs. More choice and more competition, not more government, is the solution to bring down health care costs in this country. He supports our military and understands that creating and maintaining the most lethal fighting force in the history of the world is the best way to prevent the forever wars that have taken the lives of far too many Americans and burdened future generations with unnecessary debt. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Donald Trump stands up to dictators in Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and China, using his platform and his pulpit to make clear that there will be no safe harbor for those who kill and deny human rights to their own people, support terrorism, and foment hatred of the United States. He believes in the greatness of America \u2013 a country that, while flawed, is the greatest country in the history of the world. A country that has created more opportunity for more people than any other place on earth. Now think about former Vice President Joe Biden. He\u2019s a nice enough guy, but after 47 years in politics, with few accomplishments to his name, why should we trust him to handle the challenges our country faces? Whether or not he\u2019s aware of it, he\u2019s a vessel for the radical policies of the new Socialist Democrat Party. They want to defund the police, making every family in this country less safe. They want \"Medicare-for-all,\" a massive government takeover of our country\u2019s health care system that would eliminate the employer-sponsored health care of more than 150 million Americans. They want the Green New Deal, a $93 trillion program that would end fossil fuels and destroy our economy. They want to allow late term abortions and want taxpayers to pay for it.\u00a0 They want open borders and free health care for illegal immigrants. They want to pack the Supreme Court \u2013 some have even floated packing the District Courts \u2013 so they can chip away at our 2nd Amendment rights and our religious freedoms. To me, this choice is simple.

O\u2019Brien told Trump, according to a new book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward. \u2026 Ten days later, Trump called Woodward and revealed that he thought the situation was far more dire than what he had been saying publicly. \u2026 At that time, Trump was telling the nation that the virus was no worse than a seasonal flu, predicting it would soon disappear and insisting that the U.S. government had it totally under control. It would be several weeks before he would publicly acknowledge that the virus was no ordinary flu and that it could be transmitted through the air. Trump admitted to Woodward on March 19 that he deliberately minimized the danger. \u2018I wanted to always play it down,\u2019 the president said.\u201dSays military leaders \u2018a bunch of pu**ies\u2019 - NYT: \u201cPresident Trump denigrated senior American military officials when he told his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, during a meeting in 2017 that his top generals were weak and overly concerned with their relationships with allies, according to a new book by the journalist Bob Woodward. And in a discussion with Mr. Woodward, Mr. Trump called the United States military \u2018suckers\u2019 for paying extensive costs to protect South Korea. \u2026 In the 2017 meeting, Mr. Woodward quoted Mr. Trump as telling Mr. Navarro that \u2018my f***ing generals are a bunch of pu**ies. They care more about their alliances than they do about trade deals.\u2019 At another point in Mr. Woodward\u2019s book, \u2018Rage,\u2019 Mr. Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, Gen.

Coats was the president's top intelligence official from March 2017 until August 2019. Woodward reports that Coats and his staff examined the intelligence regarding Trump's ties to Russia \u2018as carefully as possible\u2019 and that he \u2018still questions the relationship\u2019 between Trump and Putin despite the apparent absence of intelligence proof.\u201dArmy chief rebuts Trump claim of corruption in service - Politico: \u201cThe Army's top general defended military leaders on Tuesday after President Donald Trump accused them of going to war to keep defense contractors \u2018happy,\u2019 saying he and others take the decision to send troops into combat \u2018very, very seriously.\u2019 Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville declined to comment specifically on Trump's remarks to reporters on Monday, but defended the Pentagon brass against the accusation that they are beholden to arms manufacturers. \u2018I\u2019ve talked with generals, I\u2019ve talked with admirals, I\u2019ve talked with [sergeants major] \u2026 many of these leaders have sons and daughters who have gone to combat or may be in combat right now. So I can assure the American people that senior leaders would only recommend sending troops to combat when it's required in national security, or as a last resort,\u2019 McConville said during an event held Tuesday by Defense One.\u201dTHE RULEBOOK: SECURITY SYSTEM\u00a0 \u201cWe must receive the blow, before we could even prepare to return it.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, writing about how a lack of common defense makes repelling attackers harder, Federalist No. 25TIME OUT: TAKE A CLOSER LOOK Smithsonian: \u201c\u2026[Georgetown University has] been re-appraising the school\u2019s racist past for years. In 1838, when the Jesuit school was deep in debt, its president, Reverend Thomas F. Mulledy, sold 272 black men, women and children to Louisiana plantations to keep the school afloat. Three years ago, Georgetown pulled Mulledy\u2019s name off a dormitory, replacing it with the name of enslaved laborer Isaac Hawkins. \u2026 What makes Georgetown\u2019s reflective moment most remarkable, however, and complicated, is that 35 years after Mulledy salvaged the school\u2019s finances by selling human property, the school would be led by a man who, himself, was born enslaved. The story of Georgetown president Reverend Patrick Francis Healy reveals how a university built by enslaved persons, and rescued from collapse by the sale of enslaved persons, saw its \u2018second founding\u2019 in the late 19th century under the guidance of a man whom the Jesuits knew had been born black but helped \u2018pass\u2019 as white.\u201dFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDNATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGETrump: 42.6 percent\u00a0 \u00a0Biden: 51.2 percent\u00a0 \u00a0Size of lead: Biden by 8.6 points\u00a0 \u00a0Change from one week ago: Biden no change, Trump \u2193 0.4 points\u00a0 \u00a0[Average includes: CNN: Trump 43% - Biden 51%; Quinnipiac University: Trump 42% - Biden 52%; USA Today/Suffolk: Trump 43% - Biden 50%; Grinnell/Selzer: Trump 41% - Biden 49%; ABC News/WaPo: Trump 44% - Biden 54%.]\u00a0 \u00a0BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up: (109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)Lean R/Likely R: (180 electoral votes)Lean D/Likely D: (249 electoral votes)TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 42.8 percent\u00a0 \u00a0Average disapproval: 53.2 percent\u00a0 \u00a0Net Score: -10.4 pointsChange from one week ago: \u2191 1.2 points\u00a0 \u00a0[Average includes: Monmouth University: 42% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk: 45% approve - 52% disapprove; Grinnell/Selzer: 43% approve - 51% disapprove.] \u00a0GOT A WILD PITCH?

In early September, Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden is the choice of 47 percent of likely voters and Republican President Donald Trump is supported by 43 percent. Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen is the choice of 4 percent, while 7 percent say they would vote for none of these candidates, didn\u2019t know how they would vote or declined to say. In August, before the events in Kenosha, Biden was supported by 49 percent and Trump by 44 percent, with 6 percent not choosing either. Jorgensen was not included in the August poll. In June among likely voters, Biden had 50 percent and Trump 44 percent, with 6 percent not choosing either.\u201dDominates in Pennsylvania - NBC News: \u201cDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by a 9-point margin among likely voters in Pennsylvania, a key swing state where Biden was born, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll.

Kamala Harris of California, get the support of 53 percent of likely Pennsylvania voters, compared with 44 percent who back Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. In 2016, Trump barely bested Hillary Clinton in the state by less than 1 percentage point. Trump gets upside-down job approval from the Keystone State, although he still maintains an advantage on handling the economy. And Biden is doing far better among suburban voters and whites than Clinton did four years ago. Forty-five percent of likely voters say they approve of the job the president is doing, while 52 percent disapprove. And just 44 percent have a favorable impression of Trump, while 54 percent have a negative one.\u201dCrushing Trump in Pennsylvania ad war - The Philadelphia Inquirer: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s campaign spent $10 million on television advertising in Pennsylvania last month, as the Democratic nominee maintained his lead in the polls and President Donald Trump halted his TV spending in the state. The Biden campaign spent an additional $5 million through Labor Day, while Trump remained off the Pennsylvania airwaves during the first week of September, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics. In all, Biden outspent Trump by $15 million to zero over the course of about five weeks. The spending advantage is notable given that Trump won Pennsylvania by less than one percentage point in 2016 and faces a relatively narrow path to reelection. It\u2019s also a sign that the Trump campaign has burned through much of the huge cash advantage it built during the Democratic primary contest.\u201dBiden focused on rebuilding Blue Wall - AP: \u201cIn 2016, Donald Trump tore down Democrats\u2019 \u2018blue wall,\u2019 winning the White House with surprise victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. This year, Joe Biden is trying to rebuild. The Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s first pandemic-era campaign trips beyond his home in Delaware are taking him to all three states, an indication of how closely Biden\u2019s electoral prospects are tied to his ability to flip those political battlegrounds. Last week, Biden traveled to Wisconsin and was followed quickly by running mate Kamala Harris, who held her own events there on Labor Day. On Wednesday, Biden heads to Michigan to tout a plan for boosting U.S. manufacturing. He also has two stops scheduled this week in Pennsylvania. Though the Biden campaign often emphasizes that it sees multiple ways to secure the 270 Electoral College votes it needs to win in November, the quickest path runs through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u201dPopulist plan on outsourcing - Fox News: \u201cDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden unveiled a plan to help American workers on Wednesday, promising a series of executive actions and blaming President Trump for a manufacturing recession. Key features of \u2018The Biden-Harris Plan to Fight for Workers by Delivering on Buy America and Make It in America\u2019 include a penalty against American companies that offshore manufacturing and service jobs to other countries and then sell back to the U.S. market. It also calls for a \u2018Made in America\u2019 tax credit. \u2018President Trump talks and talks \u2013 but he has failed to deliver results for American workers,\u2019 said an outline of the plan from the Biden-Harris campaign. \u2018That ends under the Biden-Harris administration.\u2019 The offshoring penalty would include a 10% surtax on top of a 28% corporate tax rate. The plan specifically notes that it would apply to call centers or other services that American companies place in other countries to serve the American market, when those jobs could be in the U.S.\u201dTRUMP FUNDRAISING LAGS BIDEN BY MORE THAN 40 PERCENT Fox News: \u201cThe Trump campaign and Republican National Committee raked in $210 million in August \u2026 short of the record-smashing amount Democratic nominee Joe Biden and the Democrats brought in during the same time period. The Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee announced last week that they had brought in an unprecedented $364.5 million in August. A senior Trump campaign official told Fox News on Wednesday that the campaign, all told, has raised more than $1.3 billion since the beginning. The campaign's cash-on-hand figure was not clear.\u201dTrump hones in on Harris to help with Roman Catholic voters - AP: \u201cSoon after Joe Biden tapped Kamala Harris as his running mate, some conservatives began trying to portray her as anti-Catholic \u2014 a line of attack that President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign continues to amplify as Democrats court Roman Catholic voters. The charge stems in part from questions Harris posed in 2018 to a federal judicial nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a lay Catholic fraternal organization. Harris asked the nominee if he agreed with the anti-abortion views of the group\u2019s leader, views that broadly align with the church\u2019s stance. It inflamed Republicans at the time, with one senator authoring a resolution to affirm the constitutional ban on religious tests for federal officials and state that membership in the Catholic group is not \u2018disqualifying.\u2019 Now that Harris is Biden\u2019s running mate, conservatives are replaying the moment to try to chip at the pro-abortion-rights Democratic ticket\u2019s appeals to religious voters.\u201dMCCONNELL CUTS OFFER IN HALF, PASSAGE UNLIKELYAP: \u201cThe Senate prepared to vote this week on a trimmed-down Republican coronavirus relief package, though it only has a slim chance of passage in the face of Democrats' insistence for more sweeping aid. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the approximately $500 billion measure on Tuesday as senators returned to Washington for an abbreviated pre-election session, but hopes were dimming for another coronavirus relief bill \u2014 or much else. Republicans struggling to retain their Senate majority this fall have been divided, with some GOP senators in close races anxious to respond further to the pandemic, even as conservatives are tiring of all the spending and passing legislation in concert with liberal House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u2026 Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine are eager to show constituents they are continuing to work to ease the pandemic's disastrous impact... But many Senate Republicans are resisting more spending, and the scaled-back bill is roughly half the size of a measure McConnell unveiled earlier this summer.\u201dPergram: Members jockey as congressional leadership elections loom - Fox News: \u201cElection Day falls on Nov. 3. But another set of crucial elections falls in late November or early December on Capitol Hill. These are internal leadership elections staged by both parties in the House and Senate. Rank-and-file members vote in the House and Senate Democratic caucuses on their party leaders. The same unfolds in the House and Senate Republican conferences. These elections often establish the course of legislation and set the face of the party. The consequences sometimes reverberate for years, if not decades. We\u2019ve written before that decisions made in congressional leadership elections are \u2018particle politics.\u2019 You\u2019ve heard of \u2018partisan politics.\u2019 But the choices made as to who matriculates to serve as House and Senate leaders are made at the subatomic political level.

His bait of choice? Vienna sausages. According to an arrest report, 26-year-old Brandon Harmon was arrested on Aug. 26. The incident began when a deputy with the Henry County Sheriff's Office was sent to Goodlett Circle, in Smithfield, after someone said Harmon was trespassing on their property. When the deputy found Harmon, he asked the deputy for a ride to McCoun Road, where Harmon said he would point out a weed trimmer that had been stolen. \u2026 At that point, Harmon changed the subject and asked \u2026 what had happened to [the Sheriff\u2019s Office] K-9 that had been taken from a deputy's property on Aug. 8. \u2026 When confronted about what he knew \u2026 Harmon allegedly told the deputy that he \u2018had something to do with it.\u2019 \u2018I coaxed him out with Vienna sausages,\u2019 Harmon told the deputy, according to the arrest report.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cA future trivia question and historical footnote, the spectacular 10-day flameout of Anthony Scaramucci qualifies as the most entertaining episode yet of the ongoing reality show that is the Trump presidency.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Aug. 3, 2017.Chris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "\u2018The Five\u2019 break down the 2020 presidential race as the final week of campaigning begins. The Washington Examiner announced its endorsement of President Trump's reelection on Monday, but\u00a0the conservative magazine's own editor separately declared that he cannot vote for the GOP incumbent. \"A vote for Trump is a vote against Democrats' constitutional norm-smashing\" the Examiner endorsement was headlined. \"President Trump\u2019s character is no national secret. He is crude, sometimes brutal, and manifestly not what most people would call 'presidential.'\u00a0He admits as much himself. But he is not running for reelection in a vacuum. He is running against a man and, even more, against a party that are deeply flawed and dangerous.\" The editorial denounced Joe Biden's struggle to disavow \"left-wing urban violence\" as well his punting on the question\u00a0of packing the Supreme Court. It argued that since the 2020 election is a \"binary choice,\" readers should\u00a0support\u00a0Trump on policy as well as for the \"truly urgent reason\" of preventing\u00a0Democrats from \"upending the Constitution.\" NY POST ENDORSES TRUMP: 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN' AND 'TICK OFF' HOLLYWOOD WITH REELECTION \"Yes, Trump has smashed norms of presidential behavior, mostly symbolic and rhetorical. But the very institutions Democrats are now trying to destroy or undermine \u2014 the ballot box, the Senate, and the judiciary \u2014 have kept his worst excesses in check,\" the Examiner explained.\u00a0\"He does not threaten the structure of the republic, but the Democrats' new schemes do pose just such a threat to the nation\u2019s unity and continued success.\" The endorsement\u00a0acknowledged Trump's \"often-embarrassing personal conduct\" and \"misguided policies,\" but insisted\u00a0\"his\u00a0administration\u2019s policy successes outweigh its failures.\" Conversely, the magazine sounded the alarm that Biden \"spent the general election season moving leftward,\" pointing to his vow to raise taxes, restore Obamacare, and implement a \"crippling Green New Deal-style plan.\" \"The most important reason is that Democrats are promising to change the rules of governance to secure permanent power, packing the courts and insulating themselves from voters by packing the U.S. Senate,\" the Examiner continued. \"Trump's manner and character inspire strong doubts, but when conservatives vote, they should keep in mind the damage that Democrats openly promise to inflict on our republic. The only meaningful way to prevent it is to leave Trump where he is.\" SUSAN FERRECHIO TORCHES BRIAN STELTER FOR DISMISSING HUNTER BIDEN NEWS, DEFENDING RUSSIA COVERAGE While the president earned the magazine's official endorsement, he did not earn the support of its executive editor Seth Mandel, who explained in a separate op-ed \"Why I can't vote for Trump.\" \"I was one of the conservatives who opposed Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016, and as he racked up conservative victories in office and presided over economic growth, we were often asked if we felt foolish yet,\" Mandel wrote.\u00a0\"I can\u2019t speak for others, but I had not premised my opposition on an ideological litmus test. Every president is tested, I would respond, and President Trump hasn\u2019t been tested yet. Then, suddenly, he was.\" According to Mandel, Trump's response to COVID-19 included a failure to \"establish a serious testing regime\", \"ridiculing mask-wearing\",\u00a0an outbreak in the president's\u00a0inner circle, and\u00a0\"public scorn for his own scientific advisers [that] leaves the public confused and susceptible to less reliable sources of information.\" Mandel then pivoted to the\u00a0\"perceived threat posed by a Biden administration,\" which he suggested is\u00a0overblown. \"The extreme direction in which his party is headed is clear. But it is less clear to me that a Joe Biden presidency would haplessly elevate those extreme elements,\" Mandel explained.\u00a0\"It is possible his nomination itself showed he has a few more allies than previously assumed. This hurts the case for Trump because it removes the professed urgency of his message: Apres moi, le deluge.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"As a conservative, the environment the president has built ... is unhealthy, and I am concerned that a vote for his reelection would constitute a vote for this as the new normal,\" the editor continued. \"And I consider his bad tweets often to be more than gracelessness; some have policy consequences, others seem designed to deepen the division pulling Americans into a spiral of tribalism that continues to splinter society. And his use of birtherism to catapult to fame on the Right, and his similar race-baiting of foreign-born members of Congress, if further rewarded, will do lasting damage.\" Joseph A.

Sign up\u00a0here.**\u00a0On the roster: Hail, Weirdos! - What to expect when we\u2019re projecting - Strapped down, shaken out and ready to ride\u00a0HAIL, WEIRDOS!The old adage goes like this: If you pray for patience, God will give you opportunities to practice waiting patiently. If you pray for restraint, God will give you opportunities to practice acting in a restrained way, etc.\u00a0We offer no judgment on the theology of such sentiments, but they come to mind readily as we contemplate what may be the highest turnout election in the modern era.\u00a0For years, we have heard the lamentations about the low level of voter engagement in U.S. elections. Well, they\u2019re sure as shooting engaged now \u2013 and yet few are greeting this tidal wave of expected turnout with glad tidings. And that\u2019s too bad.\u00a0We should point out that we do not place any moral value on turnout in this note. Like the song goes: \u201cIf you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\u201d Increased democratic participation does not correlate with good governance. Brazil and Russia out-vote the U.S. on a per capita basis every time, and they remain, well, Brazil and Russia.\u00a0This is different, of course, than instances in America when voters want to participate but are thwarted by incompetent administration or attempted disenfranchisement etc. States should be at least as good at collecting your vote as they are in collecting your taxes. But apathetic acceptance of the status quo is not immoral. Vote, don\u2019t vote \u2013 knock yourselves out.\u00a0But for those who have agonized over low voter turnout \u2013 an average of about 54 percent of eligible voters in the five presidential elections this century \u2013 their prayers are being answered.\u00a0We are on track this year to cross the 60-percent threshold for the first time since 1968 and the start of the Voting Rights Act era. Nearly 100 million Americans have already returned their early or absentee ballots, with more coming in every moment. If Election Day projections hold true, we should end up with more than 150 million total ballots cast out of a vote-eligible population of about 257 million adults.\u00a0And why is that? Because times are troubled. The two lowest-turnout elections of the modern era, 1988 and 2000, were held during periods of peace and prosperity. The two highest-turnout years, 1968 and 2008, took place amid periods of panic and anxiety.\u00a0This is related to a story we mentioned to you some time ago. In September, the annual\u00a0Constitution Day survey\u00a0from the Annenberg Public Policy Center found a huge surge in Americans\u2019 civics knowledge.\u00a0We are members of that small but noisy chorus always demanding more civics and American history education in schools (and for adults), but what it really took to get folks to pay attention were crisis conditions \u2013 an impeachment and a pandemic.\u00a0We shouldn\u2019t all have to vote like our lives depended on it every two years, nor should Americans have to hover over the functions of the federal government like a pot about to boil over. But when trouble comes, Americans respond.\u00a0And this is why we have made our mantra this year \u201cBelieve in America.\u201d\u00a0Unlike the citizens of so many less-fortunate nations, we have someplace to turn when things get choppy: The Constitution and the ballot box. Time and time again, when looking for a way out of a jam, we have ultimately returned to the wisdom of our founding. Our long-ago departure from the norms of millennia of human history continues to serve us well.\u00a0As\u00a0Hunter Thompson\u00a0wrote, \u201cWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\u201d\u00a0Well, in this very weird year, Americans are acting like the pros we are.THE RULEBOOK: BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER\u201cThe most plausible of these, who has appeared in print, has even deigned to admit that the election of the President is pretty well guarded. I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the union of which was to be wished for.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton, writing about the mode of electing the president,\u00a0Federalist No. 68SCOREBOARDBATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(115 electoral votes): Georgia (16) Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(164 electoral votes)Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(259 electoral votes)*WATCH FOX: Special coverage begins tonight at 6 pm ET with the latest results, best analysis and regular updates from the Decision Desk.*WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN WE\u2019RE PROJECTINGBecause there are going to be so many more votes cast than in 2016 and so many more of them will be cast by mail, it is making the counting quite challenging for state and local officials.\u00a0And while that has implications for our ability to project winners and losers on the Fox News Decision Desk, it doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t be able to make calls \u2013 and lots of them.\u00a0Gone are the days of exit polls. We now rely on the Fox News Voter Analysis. You can read more about our methods and track results as polls close\u00a0here\u00a0and get an overview of our offerings, including probability meters,\u00a0here. But as those who recall our coverage in 2018 already know, we have found a way to get past the longstanding failures of old-fashioned exit polls.\u00a0Keep an eye on those probability meters, because unlike the raw vote totals that may be dominated by early votes or Election Day votes or votes from one part of a state, the meters will reflect the results in the context of the total expected results.\u00a0\u00a0The massive turnout and the potentially large number of first-time and infrequent voters have introduced some uncertainty into forecasters\u2019 models. But once we start seeing how voters are really behaving, things should firm up quickly giving us a good sense of which states are strongly leaning one way or another and which states are going to be very close.\u00a0There are\u00a0tons\u00a0of election-night watching guides out there (we like\u00a0this one\u00a0from FiveThirtyEight among others), but we\u2019re not going to get nitty-gritty on when you should expect what. As we\u00a0laid out Monday, there are vast differences between potential outcomes, which create corresponding gaps between when we might call various races.\u00a0If\u00a0President Trump\u00a0is going to pull an even bigger bunny out of his hat than he did four years ago, we may not be able to call the presidency for days. If\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is headed for a decisive win, it may be a relatively early night.\u00a0But if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to keep score at the baseball game, you\u2019ll find below the line-up for this evening so you can follow along.\u00a0A good rule of thumb is that any contested state south of the Mason-Dixon Line that comes in for the Democrats is seriously bad news for Republicans. Any contested state north of the line that comes in for the GOP is bad news for the Dems.\u00a0Otherwise, have fun and don\u2019t let yourself get too worked up about the results. It\u2019s just an election. We\u2019ll have another one in two years.\u00a0[Ed. note: Credit to my dear friend and \u201cNerd Number One\u201d\u00a0Arnon Mishkin\u00a0for the headline on this item.

A trooper pulled over the driver on Highway 63 in northwestern Wisconsin on Sunday afternoon after seeing the snowmobile perched sideways on top of the sedan. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation tweeted a photo of the car with the Polaris topper on Monday with a message: \u2018Folks, don\u2019t try this at home.\u2019 The 23-year-old driver was issued a warning about the hauling technique and cited for failing to buckle up, according to DOT spokeswoman\u00a0Christena O\u2019Brien. The driver,\u00a0Matthew Schmit, of Clayton, told the trooper he had just bought the snowmobile and was driving it over to a friend\u2019s house to show him, the Star Tribune reported. \u2018I know it looks sketchy, but we had it strapped down and shook it,\u2019 he said. \u2018Up like in this kind of region, stuff like this gets seen all the time, but more like the back roads.\u2019\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThe only question is whose name I\u2019m going to write in.

            "article_content": "Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks at the final night of the 2020 Republican National Convention. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani slammed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio during the final night of the Republican National Convention, while warning that a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for \u201clawlessness.\" \u201cIn 2013, my city elected a self-described progressive Democrat as mayor. New York City, once described as America\u2019s crime capital, had become by the mid-1990s America\u2019s safest large city,\u201d he said. \u201cNow today, my city is in shock.\u201d BIDEN SAYS 'NEEDLESS VIOLENCE WON'T HEAL US' AFTER BLAKE SHOOTING Giuliani, who also has served as the president\u2019s personal attorney, painted a grim picture of New York City, saying \u201cmurders, shootings and violent crime are increasing at percentages unheard of in the past\u201d and a return of \u201crioting and looting\u201d is being witnessed. Giuliani said that during the riots\u00a0this summer, \"this Democrat mayor, like others, has often prevented the police from making arrests.\" \"Even when arrests are made, liberal 'progressive' DAs release the rioters\u00a0so as not to disrupt the looting,\" he said. \u201cNew Yorkers wonder how did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and decline so fast?\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThey elected de Blasio because of their reflexive historical instinct to vote for a Democrat just because he was a Democrat and not to consider carefully his destructive policies and inadequate background.\u201d He added: \u201cDon\u2019t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York.\u201d DE BLASIO'S DESCENT: HOW NEW YORK CITY'S MAYOR BECAME SO UNPOPULAR Giuliani claimed that Democrats are \u201curging\u201d voters to vote for \u201can obviously defective candidate,\u201d referring to former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cBiden has changed his principles os often, he no longer has any principles,\u201d he said, calling him a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d with Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \u201cBlack Lives Matter and his party\u2019s entire left wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies.\u201d Giuliani said that the 2020 election is \u201ca choice between the Democrat policies, soft on crime, against the Republican program of law and order.\u201d TRUMP SENDING FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, NATIONAL GUARD TO KENOSHA AFTER JACOB BLAKE SHOOTING \u201cIt is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, town or suburb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can come to where you live.\u201d Giuliani added that if Biden is elected, \u201cthen the crime wave will intensify and spread from cities and towns to suburbs and beyond.\u201d Giuliani called the November election \u201ctruly the most important election in my lifetime.\u201d \u201cThe Democrats want to change our system of government and the most basic values we cherish. If they win that is exactly what they will do,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere is also no question that Donald Trump will do just the opposite and fight with all his strength to preserve the American system of government and our way of life.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s speech, focused on law and order, comes amid months of unrest in cities across the country. This week, violence spread to Kenosha, Wis., after 29-year-old Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot at close range in the back by city police officer Rusten Sheskey, leaving him partially paralyzed. President Trump on Wednesday said he will send federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wis.\u00a0to restore \u201claw and order\u201d amid days of unrest in the city. Democratic nominee Joe Biden argued Thursday that Trump is exploiting the violence for his own reasons. \"[Trump] views this as a political benefit to him,\" Biden said in an interview on MSNBC. \"He's rooting for more violence, not less. ... If\u00a0we want to end where we are now, we've got to end his tenure as president.\"",

            "article_content": "Ronna McDaniel, RNC Chairwoman, explains how the GOP plans on holding a 'healthy and safe' convention With less than four months to go until Election Day, Nov. 3\u00a0is starting to get \u201cawfully big in the window,\u201d to paraphrase Tom Hanks in the movie \"Apollo 13.\" Next month Republicans and Democrats will hold their national conventions to formally nominate their candidates for president and to conduct party business.\u00a0Although this year\u2019s conventions will look much different than usual on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, essential party functions will still take place.\u00a0One noteworthy difference this year will be the party platforms.\u00a0Because Gov.\u00a0Roy Cooper, D-N.C.,\u00a0played politics,\u00a0Republicans changed the location of their\u00a0convention\u00a0from Charlotte to Jacksonville and will keep the successful America First platform from 2016\u00a0intact.\u00a0On the Democratic side, it is yet to be determined exactly how they will debate their radical left-wing 2020 platform. Due to the coronavirus and a lack of traditional campaigning by President Trump and his Democrat opponent former Vice President Joe Biden, this year the party platforms will take on much greater significance than usual and the American people would be wise to take a serious look. TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIMS TO EXPAND THE 2020 ELECTORAL MAP AMID CHALLENGING LANDSCAPE After all, only one candidate -- President Trump -- is regularly answering questions from the press and fully engaging in the national debate in the midst of the unforgettable summer of 2020. Former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden on the other hand is rolling the dice with what I call the \u201cTahiti strategy\u201d of staying away from the campaign trail and only coming up for air from his basement when absolutely necessary.\u00a0With this enormous in-kind corporate contribution from his allies in the liberal media, Biden is getting the largest free pass we\u2019ve seen in modern history. With President Trump\u2019s daily back and forth with reporters and his unprecedented accessibility, the American people are already well-acquainted with the Republican platform.\u00a0It centers on the greatness of our republic -- \u201cthe last best hope of earth\u201d as Abraham Lincoln described it --\u00a0and articulates why tens of millions of people from around the world want to come to our shores legally to pursue the American Dream.\u00a0On the issues, Republicans stand for the pro-growth economic principles of low taxes and deregulation;\u00a0a border wall and enforcement of our immigration laws;\u00a0a health care delivery system with more private-sector competition;\u00a0and unwavering support for the Constitution, Bill of Rights, rule of law\u00a0and sanctity of life.\u00a0Republicans also understand the importance of maintaining American history and know that the fascists who seek to erase our history are doomed to repeat it. With network and cable news covering the coronavirus, police violence, racial unrest, protests, rioting, an explosion in city shootings and the destruction of statues and monuments on an endless loop, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the fact that career politician Joe Biden is not the Joe Biden from 10, 20, or 30 years ago.\u00a0The Joe Biden of today has become a radical socialist out of political necessity because the mob is calling the shots on the political left.\u00a0And that\u2019s why the platform coming out of the Democratic\u00a0National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis.,\u00a0that will take place from Aug. 17-20 will be so telling.\u00a0It will make clear that Joe Biden --\u00a0in his decades-long obsession to become president -- will now do whatever the America-haters tell him to do. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In fact, the 2020 Democratic\u00a0platform will be the most un-American, socialist-inspired document to come out of a major party convention in American history. For starters, I predict the 2020 Democratic platform will call for massive tax increases that will stop our economic recovery in its tracks; embrace \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which would throw untold millions of Americans off of their private health insurance plans; support open borders and taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants; and go back to the Obama-era policy of giving away the store to China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By all accounts, this alone would be characterized as a wildly unpopular, outside the mainstream platform, but what comes next is truly terrifying for the future of the United States of America.\u00a0On the eve of the 2008 presidential election, then-candidate\u00a0Barack Obama said he was planning on \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d\u00a0While many Americans took note of Obama\u2019s mysterious proclamation, it was unclear what he actually meant.\u00a0Now, with the left\u2019s call to defund police, delete our nation\u2019s history by destroying monuments and statues, damage churches both physically and constitutionally, pack the Supreme Court, end the filibuster\u00a0and shred our founding documents, we know.\u00a0And recently Joe Biden encouraged this dangerous movement by tweeting \u201cwe won\u2019t just rebuild this nation -- we'll transform it.\u201d We\u2019re living in historic and turbulent times, and it\u2019s become critically important for law-abiding, hard-working American taxpayers from all backgrounds to stand up for their country by not giving in to the mob that has formed on the political left.\u00a0This dangerous movement has been aided and abetted by Democratic\u00a0politicians as well as the liberal media.\u00a0Now, it must be confronted by the forgotten men and women who will turn out in record numbers to vote for their family, faith, security, prosperity\u00a0and country and reelect President Donald Trump.

Sign up here.**On the roster: What\u2019s the deal with Arizona? - I\u2019ll Tell You What: Who wouldn\u2019t wanna be like America? - Great Lakes States polling smorgasbord - Biden casts ballot, manages expectations on corona - Canada, manWHAT\u2019S THE DEAL WITH ARIZONA?When Hillary Clinton campaigned in Arizona four years ago, it was touted as the frontrunning Democrat going \u201cfor the kill.\u201dWhat we would find out later was that the move was either desperation or misdirection by a campaign more consumed by psychodrama than an episode of \u201cBeverly Hills 90210.\u201dBut nobody is fooling anybody about Arizona, this time. President Trump is campaigning today in the Grand Canyon State, which he won by a little more than 3 points in 2016. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris is there too as the two parties fight for the most surprising, revealing swing state of 2020.The latest polling out of Arizona says what most surveys have been showing for months: A persistent advantage for former Vice President Joe Biden and an even better showing for Democratic Senate nominee Mark Kelly. There are some signs that the race is tightening, but Republicans still need a substantial turnaround to hold onto this fast-growing Southwestern state.To put it in perspective, Trump is underperforming his polling average in Arizona by more than 7 points compared to the last time around.Part of Arizona\u2019s story this year is a very predictable one.As Americans have flocked to Arizona and the state has grown more prosperous, younger voters \u2013 both natives and job seekers \u2013 and more moderate snowbirds have changed the polity of this once bright-red dessert redoubt for Republicans.As Trump\u2019s improved standing with Hispanic voters has demonstrated, the issue here for Republicans isn\u2019t so much about the ethnic demography of the state but instead the economic and education trendlines. More college graduates, more upper-middle-class voters is never good news for the GOP these days.This helps us explain how Republicans lost the 2018 Senate race in Arizona to moderate Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema. As Republicans struggle in the suburbs and as Arizona becomes more suburban, problems will arise for the Red Team. Maybe think of it this way: as shrinking states like Ohio move to the red side, they\u2019re crossing paths with growing states like Arizona.But demography is not really destiny, sorry Aguste Comte. There are also the choices people make.Take, for instance, the choice to select Martha McSally, the woman Sinema beat, to fill the seat left vacant by the death of John McCain. It might have worked in another seat or state, but to replace McCain, revered for his bipartisanship and gentility, in such a partisan power play was no smart move.But even less smart was Trump\u2019s decision to wage a relentless war with McCain and the state\u2019s other former senator, Jeff Flake. It\u2019s one thing to rip on your fellow Republicans in Senate races in Alabama or Utah or other iron-clad winners. But to antagonize swing state voters for years with these squabbles? It makes no sense.We have been \u2013 and remain \u2013 consistently skeptical about Arizona\u2019s pronounced lean in the polls. Like Texas, we would be little surprised to see Trump do better than expected in current polls.But if Republicans do screw around and lose Arizona like they did Nevada before it, it won\u2019t just be the changing population of the state, but the choices Trump and his party made.\u00a0 \u00a0THE RULEBOOK: OFF THE CHARTS\u201cThis idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is no rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of any given number of individuals\u2026\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, writing about the advantages of the Union,\u00a0Federalist No. 13TIME OUT: PRETTY SPIFFY, JIFFYGarden&Gun: \u201cAt this point, pastry chef Kelly Fields\u2019s cornbread has achieved its own level of celebrity.

This year, Michigan is trending with those states again, but in the wrong direction for Mr. Trump\u2019s hopes of re-election. Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, had the support of 49 percent of likely voters in the poll, and Mr. Trump was at 41 percent, virtually unchanged from a Times/Siena survey of Michigan two weeks ago.\u201dMarquette Law says Biden ahead by a steady 6 in Wisconsin - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \u201cDemocrat Joe Biden holds a 5-point lead over President Donald Trump in Wisconsin, according to Wednesday's Marquette University Law School Poll. Biden is backed by 48% of likely Wisconsin voters while Trump is supported by 43%. Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen is at 2%, while 8% say they're either undecided, won't reveal their preference or won't vote. Marquette's final survey before Tuesday's vote was in line with its polling throughout the campaign season. Since May, Biden's lead over Trump has fluctuated between 4 and 6 points in Wisconsin.\u201dABC/WaPo says Biden dominates Wisconsin, has clear edge in Michigan -\u00a0ABC News: \u201cA surge in coronavirus cases has damaged President Donald Trump's re-election campaign in Wisconsin, with growing criticism of his work on the pandemic and preference for former Vice President Joe Biden to handle it. Biden holds a slighter advantage in Michigan, with sizable leads among women, moderates and independents in ABC News/Washington Post polls in both states. Biden leads Trump by 57-40% among likely voters in Wisconsin, a state that's now reported to be third in the nation in per capita COVID-19 cases, with a 53% increase in average daily cases in the past two weeks, a record number of hospitalizations and a 112% jump in deaths. That compares with a closer 52-46% in mid-September. In Michigan, it's 51-44%, Biden-Trump, among likely voters, a slight Biden lead in this poll\u2026\u201dBIDEN CASTS BALLOT, MANAGES EXPECTATIONS ON CORONAAP: \u201cJoe Biden said Wednesday he\u2019s \u2018not running on the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch\u2019 but would prioritize science, while President Donald Trump used the race\u2019s final days to keep up a whirlwind campaign schedule aimed at focusing on anything but the coronavirus. The Democratic presidential nominee tried to keep the focus on health care, arguing that a Supreme Court conservative majority stretched to 6-3 by newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett could dismantle the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law and leave millions of Americans with preexisting conditions devoid of insurance coverage. Biden kept most of his focus on the virus, saying Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic was an \u2018insult\u2019 to its victims, especially as cases rise dramatically around the country. \u2026 Biden voted early in Delaware on Wednesday and also received a virtual briefing from public health experts.\u201dBiden jumps ahead in Georgia poll -\u00a0Monmouth University: \u201cThe race for Georgia\u2019s electoral votes remains very close, but Joe Biden has gained ground on Donald Trump in the latest Monmouth University Poll.\u00a0 \u2026 Among all registered voters in Georgia, Biden is supported by 50% and Trump is supported by 45%. \u2026 In a high turnout model, Biden has 50% support and Trump has 46%. Trump led in this model by 2 points in September and one point in July. The race is tighter using a lower turnout model at 50% Biden and 48% Trump, whereas the incumbent led by 3 to 5 points in this model in prior polls. Trump won Georgia by five points in 2016.\u201dTEAM TRUMP REBOOTS LAPTOP STROY AS MEDIA HIT\u00a0Politico: \u201cWeeks ago, when Rudy Giuliani first threw the contents of Hunter Biden\u2019s alleged laptop online, he promised a trove of even more damning information 10 days before the election. Yet with less than a week to go, Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, is still moving down the conservative media food chain, looking for takers. The Wall Street Journal and Fox News have both reported finding no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden benefited from the Hunter Biden business dealings that have drawn scrutiny. More explicitly pro-Trump media outlets \u2014 OAN, Breitbart, Newsmax \u2014 have mostly shied away from publishing fresher, more salacious allegations. And conservative talking heads \u2014 pundits, politicians and loud MAGA Twitter personalities alike \u2014 have been more focused on the meta narrative around the laptop, arguing that mainstream media, social media companies and the deep state are conspiring to prevent President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection by suppressing the story.\u201dBiden not biting -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cJoe Biden and his presidential campaign are staying mum after Hunter Biden\u2019s former business associate went public to say he met twice in the past with the former vice president -- despite past statements from Biden on the campaign trail that he had no involvement with or discussions about his family's overseas business ventures. That associate, Tony Bobulinski, gave an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 on Tuesday and detailed his alleged meetings with the former vice president\u2026\u201dDevotees endure punishing cold to cheer Trump - Omaha World-Herald: \u201cHundreds of people who attended President Donald Trump\u2019s rally Tuesday evening at Eppley Airfield spent up to three hours in freezing temperatures waiting for buses to take them back to their cars. Paramedics took six people to local hospitals \u2018due to a variety of medical conditions,\u2019 said Tim Conahan, police chief for the Omaha Airport Authority. Conahan said just over 21,000 people were screened into the event, and more people were still inside the queue line awaiting screening. Trump said during his speech Tuesday that 29,000 people were there. The president, who spoke for nearly an hour, wrapped up shortly before 9 p.m. Some people in his audience waited until after midnight for campaign buses to take them to their cars, which were parked miles away.\u201dWOLF TAKES NO CHANCES ON RIOTS IN SWING STATE PA.Fox News: \u201cThe Pennsylvania National Guard was deployed to Philadelphia Tuesday as the city braces for a second night of violent riots after tense confrontations between angry demonstrators and police hours after two officers shot and killed a Black man. Several hundred guardsmen will assist local agencies in \u2018protecting life, property and the right to peacefully assemble and protest,\u2019 Lt. Col. Keith Hickox said in a statement Tuesday. \u2026 The move by Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to activate the guard is a stark difference from other Democratic governors who have been hesitant or slow to mobilize troops in response to unfolding unrest. The Philadelphia Police Department will also beef up its presence across the city in anticipation of possible unrest over the death of Walter Wallace Jr., 27, city leaders said.\u201dDemocrats doubt the Pennsylvania polls -\u00a0NYT: \u201cPolls show Mr. Biden leading by five to 13 points, but I grew up around here and am dubious. This place \u2014 the land of hoagies and Bradley Cooper and Rocky Balboa worship and Tina Fey\u2019s \u2018Cousin Karen\u2019 accent \u2014 has transmogrified into Trumplandia. \u2018He has so much more support than in 2016, because it\u2019s been four years of accomplishments,\u2019 said Darinna Thompson, 49, a homemaker who was talking with a group of women outside the Trump Store. They were part of a caravan that had just encircled the Democrats\u2019 rally \u2018to say bye-bye to Biden\u2019 and let his supporters know they were outnumbered. \u2026 My parents, who are divorced and haven\u2019t agreed on anything in 20 years, both plan to vote for Joe Biden. They say that, in their respective circles, this makes them unique.\u201dPERDUE FALTERS, LOEFFLER CAN\u2019T SHAKE COLLINSMonmouth University: \u201cRepublican incumbent David Perdue has lost his lead in Georgia\u2019s regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election. Among all registered voters, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff is backed by 49% and 46% support Perdue. \u2026 The race is close among likely voters. \u2026 However, just one month ago, Perdue held anywhere from a 5-point (high turnout) to 8-point (low turnout) lead depending on the likely voter model. The other Senate seat will be decided by a special election, featuring a blanket primary with 20 listed candidates on the November ballot. Democrat Raphael Warnock has pulled into a clear lead, with 41% support among registered voters, up from 21% in September and just 9% in July. \u2026The battle for second place is very close between two Republicans. Incumbent Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat earlier this year, has 21% support and Congressman Doug Collins has 18%.\u201dWarnock follows Abrams\u2019 playbook -\u00a0Politico: \u201cRev. Raphael Warnock, a first-time political candidate who could be the key to a Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate\u2026 Warnock, the 51-year-old senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, has adopted a get-out-the-vote strategy focused on ginning up enthusiasm among first-time voters and liberal diehards. It\u2019s similar to what Stacey Abrams attempted in her failed 2018 gubernatorial bid. But with anti-Trump sentiment running high and control of the Senate possibly at stake, Democrats here think this time will be different. Drawing on his past work as chairman of the New Georgia Project \u2014 an organization founded by Abrams \u2014 Warnock is aiming to turn out young and minority voters at record levels. He's campaigning heavily in densely populated metro Atlanta while paying special attention to rural outposts like Cuthbert, a town of 4,000 near the Alabama border where he met DJ Ray J.\u201dJames hanging on in Michigan poll - ABC News: \u201cThe Senate race there stands at 52% for incumbent Democrat Gary Peters versus 46% for Republican John James, not a statistically significant difference, thus a rare chance this cycle for a GOP pickup, with control of the Senate in the balance. \u2026 That includes virtual ties among independents and suburbanites, groups that may prove pivotal. Peters holds wide leads among Democrats (97%), Black people (90%), liberals (87%), those worried that they or a family member might catch the coronavirus (73%) and moderates (67%). Results among Black people are among registered voters for adequate sample size. For his part, James is lifted by Republicans (93%), conservatives (87%), those less worried about catching the virus (80%) and evangelical white Protestants (68%).\u201dTillis scrambles, Cunningham tries to run out the clock - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: \u201cThe most expensive Senate race in U.S. history and one that could determine which party controls the chamber in January is down to its final week with polls tightening and North Carolina\u2019s top two candidates employing very different approaches to the final days. Incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis announced a blitz of public campaign events across the state in the final days, appearing with high-profile Republican surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, and his wife. Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham is meeting voters across the state but has not announced any campaign events that are open to the media. It\u2019s largely the strategy he and his campaign have used since allegations of marital infidelity first surfaced at the beginning of the month. He has not taken questions from the media since Oct. 9. Tillis, campaigning with Pence in Greensboro on Tuesday afternoon, attacked Cunningham over the scandal, a consistent theme for the Tillis in the final month of the race.\u201dErnst heads to Nebraska to be with Trump - The [Cedar Rapids, Iowa] Gazette: \u201cCandidates in Iowa\u2019s crucial and competitive U.S. Senate race were on the move Tuesday as they kicked off the final sprint to the Nov. 3 election. Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield embarked on a statewide bus tour that will continue to Election Day, and Republican incumbent Joni Ernst was on her way to Omaha, where she was set to appear at a campaign event with President Donald Trump. Ernst and Greenfield are locked in a close race, according to polling data. The most recent polls show a tossup. Greenfield spoke with reporters Tuesday in Des Moines before hopping on her campaign bus; she was scheduled to make stops Tuesday in Marshalltown, Clear Lake, Ames and Rippey.\u201dCollins touts vote against Barrett - Portsmouth Herald: \u201cThe single Republican dissenter, Sen. Susan Collins' vote against Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett was purely about process, and not reflective of the judge's qualifications, she said Tuesday. During a campaign stump at the Kittery Trading Post, Collins addressed her lone wolf position on the Supreme Court confirmation, saying she has a proven record of \u2018supporting my party when they are correct, and opposing when I think they're wrong.\u2019 Where the Republicans were wrong in their Monday night vote, she said, was their choice to move ahead with a Supreme Court confirmation in an election year. She noted a precedent established four years ago not to do so, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nomination when Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.\u201dBiden eyes Senate gains - Politico: \u201cNow, in the final week of the election, Biden is throwing his weight into that pitch. He campaigned in Georgia on Tuesday with Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the top Democrats running in the rapidly changing state\u2019s dual Senate races. Meanwhile, his wife, Jill Biden, was in Maine stumping with Sara Gideon, the party\u2019s candidate facing longtime GOP Sen. Susan Collins. And on Friday, Biden will make his first stop in Iowa since the state\u2019s ill-fated caucuses, where the dead-heat Senate race has become the second most expensive in the country \u2014 and Biden and Trump are locked in a tight race themselves. Biden still hasn\u2019t campaigned with every Democratic Senate hopeful, even in the swing states where the party is competitive at both levels. But his stops in Georgia and Iowa \u2026 underscore how Biden has been an asset in Democrats\u2019 fight to flip the Senate.\u201dELECTION PROS DUBIOUS ABOUT SUPCO DECIDING 2020 Roll Call: \u201cThe 2020 presidential election probably won\u2019t end in the sort of nightmare scenario where a legal challenge or recount winds up at the Supreme Court and the justices decide who wins the White House. Probably. \u2018Let\u2019s put the chances of that happening at about 5.2 percent,\u2019 Ben Ginsberg, the prominent election lawyer who led the George W. Bush campaign\u2019s legal strategy during the disputed Florida recount in 2000, has quipped in preelection webinars. Ginsberg bases that on the idea that only three of the country\u2019s 57 presidential elections have been contested and that the 2000 election had one state that was remarkably close and determined the outcome of the election. \u2026 Other election law experts agree that a Supreme Court case to determine the 2020 election would first need to meet several unlikely conditions: a narrow Electoral College count nationwide, with a legal challenge about voting in one or more states that could determine the outcome, and those challenges would depend on federal law and not just state law.\u201dAlberta: \u2018One last funny feeling about 2020\u2019 -\u00a0Politico: \u201cThe bad news for Trump supporters: 2020 is nothing like 2016. We are always fighting the last war in politics. But if we\u2019ve learned anything about American elections in the post-9/11 era, it\u2019s that volatility is a feature, not a bug. George W. Bush\u2019s \u2018mandate\u2019 in 2004 was wiped out by a Democratic rout in 2006. Barack Obama\u2019s landslide in 2008 invited a Tea Party revolution in 2010. Trump\u2019s shocking upset in 2016 was chased by a blue wave in 2018. These swings demonstrate how dramatic realignments\u2014demographically, ideologically and otherwise\u2014continue to accelerate in ways that keep both parties off balance. The coalitions that deliver victory often crumble just two years later. Four years, in this regard, amounts to an eternity.\u201dThe racial divide in politics is actually shrinking - NYT: \u201cThe gap in presidential vote preference between white and nonwhite voters has shrunk by a surprising 16 percentage points since 2016, according to an Upshot analysis of pre-election polls, as Joe Biden gains among white voters and President Trump makes inroads among Black and Hispanic voters. \u2026 The decrease in racial polarization defies the expectations of many analysts, who believed a campaign focused on appeals to issues like Black Lives Matter or law and order would do the opposite. It may also upset the hopes of some activists on the left who viewed an embrace of more progressive policies on race as a way to help Democrats carve a new path to the presidency. This path would have been powered by overwhelming support from nonwhite voters, reducing the need to cater to the more conservative white voters who backed Mr. Trump four years ago. Instead, Mr. Biden leads because of gains among those very voters.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYJudge orders Postal Service to reverse postmaster\u2019s mail collection limits -\u00a0PoliticoAUDIBLE: MMMHMMM\u201cI think it\u2019s part of our cultural understanding of politics, where\u2014if you think someone is great, you automatically think they should be president. I joke. I\u2019m like, \u2018Is Congress not good enough?\u2019\u201d \u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking to\u00a0Vanity Fair about her political future.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cLong time reader... first time responder, born out of necessity to seek a bit more Clarity from the nosebleed seats. The latest version of your opening opine pointed out a poll that divulged 68% of the polled individuals think the country is NOT on the right track. I understand politics is your thing (and you do it well) and for the most part, you walk a fine line that I appreciate. However, let\u2019s leave the dreaded current affairs of politics out of this and examine a couple of notes that could provide some perspective. #1 - We The People are in the middle of a Pandemic. Some lowly politicians have decided we can\u2019t visit our elderly in nursing homes much less bury our dearly departed with the dignity of a memorable send off and large swaths of our country can\u2019t even gather to worship our Lord & Savior for the shame due of a \u2018potential\u2019 super spreader event. #2 - We The People have been locked up for months, most with kids around 24/7, juggling work, home school and cooking again (argh!). #3 - We The People have been subjected to an intolerable mandate that the latest James Bond movie has been delayed into perpetuity and the good Lord forbid we be denied the return of \u2018Top Gun\u2019 should a few movie theaters survive the hell of this year. The point is, unless the pollster was around circa 1918 using the Pony Express to solicit results, there is no reasonable comparison to 2020 in my nearly 55yrs on this rock. I felt like a simple homage to the malaise that is 2020 might be a reasonable explanation for a good portion of the masses discontent. Not to sound cliche, but after all, this poll along with countless others was published in... you guessed it! 2020.\u201d \u2013 Dave Taylor, Lake Kiowa, Texas[Ed. note: Well put, Mr. Taylor! We can talk around and around about the other issues that are driving this election, the pandemic is at the center of it all. In \u201cThe Untouchables,\u201d Elliot Ness is growing frustrated by the bloviation of his counterpart on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with whom he and his T Men are conducting a joint raid. The Mountie has just declared that surprise is half the battle. Ness pipes up: \u201cSurprise is half the battle. Many things are half the battle. Losing is half the battle. Let us think about what is all the battle.\u201d Thanks for reading and taking the time to write.]\u201cHow may I square the unsquareable? A recent Gallup poll shows 56 percent of Americans feel they're better off now than they were four years ago, while Public Opinion Strategies shows 68 percent believe the country is moving in the wrong direction. Is this an indictment of the former as an inaccurate, long-in-the-tooth-polling service? Or is it that the latter is polling likely voters?\u201d \u2013 Gary W. Cimino, Millville, N.J.[Ed. note: We\u2019ve heard a number of Republicans reference the September survey from Gallup that said 56 percent of likely voters said they were better off than they were four years ago \u2013 the metric made famous by Ronald Reagan in his campaign against incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980. The September number was even higher than in Reagan\u2019s landslide re-election of 1984 when only 44 percent said they felt that way. That suggests to me that the question may not have a high correlation to voter preferences. Reagan won 49 states with numbers below those in Barack Obama\u2019s re-election year in which his electoral map actually shrank from 2004. Or, maybe voters perceive the question differently now in a more individualized era. As for the discrepancy between \u201cright track/wrong track,\u201d let\u2019s stick with Gallup data. Since the \u201cbetter off\u201d and \u201csatisfaction\u201d polls were taken at roughly the same time, I have to conclude that a big chunk of voters simultaneously feel that their own situation is better than it was in 2016 but that things have gone badly off track for the country.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.CANADA, MANET Canada: \u201cRaisins have been a scourge to everything from cereal to cookies, but now Drake is condemning mac and cheese to [a] similar doom.

            "article_content": "A president that achieves \"peace and prosperity' like Trump did before the pandemic should be reelected, says Michael Goodwin, New York Post columnist. In March of 2016, I wrote that I would likely support Donald Trump because he was the only presidential candidate speaking for working-class Americans. I also viewed the contempt for Trump by the media and elite of both parties as contempt for his supporters as well. As the campaign wore on, that contempt became an acceptable form of bigotry, as reflected in Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d smear at a fundraiser. On Election Day, I put aside concerns about whether Trump was ready and voted for him. My hope was that enough people agreed the nation desperately needed a course correction on policies and leadership, and that Trump, despite his background and lack of experience, could rise to the occasion. Four years later, everything has changed, not all of it for the better. Trump shook Washington to its core and remade the Republican Party, but the nation\u2019s fault lines make the divisions of four years ago seem almost quaint. LIZ PEEK: BIDEN'S VERY BAD WEEK SHAKES UP RACE AGAINST TRUMP One thing that won\u2019t change is my vote. In fact, the 2020 choice is much easier. There are two main reasons why I\u2019m sticking with Trump. One is because of what he has done, and the other is because of what his opponents have done to sabotage and overthrow him. First, the primary yardstick of a president is whether he produces peace and prosperity. Trump achieved both until the pandemic sent the economy into recession. Thankfully, the recovery is happening and a vaccine should give it rocket fuel. There are two main reasons why I\u2019m sticking with Trump.\u00a0One is because of what he has done, and the other is because of what his opponents have done to sabotage and overthrow him. Trump\u2019s most admirable trait is that he has kept his key promises. That is remarkable only because voters have too long tolerated politicians who sell one thing and deliver another. For all his flaws, the president has largely delivered what he promised. From the start, he was a jobs president and his polices benefited workers of every race and income level. His ironclad commitment to job creation was illustrated at last week\u2019s debate, where sharp contrasts with Joe Biden centered on the Democrat\u2019s pledge to raise taxes and \u201ctransition away\u201d from oil and gas. Trump correctly called both job killers. Cutting taxes and regulations, controlling immigration, supporting school choice and nominating qualified, conservative judges and Supreme Court justices are other big things Trump said he would do, and he did. Biden would do the opposite. On foreign policy, he was true to his word to wind down the longest wars and keep America out of new ones while strengthening the military. He is making historic peace between Israel and Arab states while making clear to Iran it must give up its nuclear and terrorist ambitions or be brought to its knees. True, some European allies feel neglected, but it\u2019s also true they looked down their noses at Trump\u2019s America First agenda. Though they preferred the apology tours and soft internationalism of Barack Obama, they agreed to Trump\u2019s demand to pay more for NATO. The most important and difficult Trump initiative is his\u00a0confrontation with China\u00a0over lopsided trade deals and its regional aggression. No other president even attempted it. While real progress is being made, a long struggle will be needed to reverse the three decades where China used subterfuge and theft to build its economy, often at the expense\u00a0of American jobs. Many voters believe the president wasn\u2019t focused enough on the coronavirus, a belief cemented for some when\u00a0he and the first lady got infected. Those voters have a point \u2014 up to a point. The virus was a once-in-a-century phenomenon and despite erratic presentations and odd comments, Trump\u00a0commanded an enormous mobilization\u00a0of government and industry resources and distributed them with dispatch to the states. The rapid progress on\u00a0vaccine development\u00a0is unprecedented. Any honest score card must also include the disparities in the states\u2019 performances, with governors\u00a0in New York,\u00a0New Jersey\u00a0and elsewhere issuing fatally flawed orders that led to thousands of unnecessary deaths in nursing homes. In addition, blue states that remain under\u00a0stringent lockdowns\u00a0have unemployment rates nearly twice as high as states where\u00a0GOP governors\u00a0moved faster to reopen schools and businesses. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Despite Trump\u2019s successes, or because of them, the many forces arrayed against him in 2016 refused to accept his presidency. They did everything they could to end it, and that beyond-the-pale defiance is the second reason why I will vote for him. The other side must not be rewarded for its efforts to sabotage and remove a duly-elected president. Russia, Russia, Russia was a scam\u00a0that ruined lives\u00a0and put a cloud over the White House for nearly three years. The sequel was partisan impeachment, a clumsy coup attempt orchestrated by\u00a0Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0and Trump haters in Congress, the\u00a0deep state, and the media. The press corps\u2019 bias of 2016 has morphed into\u00a0full-blown partisanship\u00a0on a daily basis at print, digital and broadcast outlets.\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and other platforms openly use their power to censor pro-Trump news and opinion while promoting anything that makes the president look bad. It\u2019s not the algorithms; it\u2019s the people behind them. Their decision to block The Post\u2019s groundbreaking reports on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals\u00a0and Joe Biden\u2019s involvement should scare anyone who treasures the First Amendment. To censors, Orwell\u2019s nightmare is their dream. All fairness has been abandoned in a frenzy to destroy Trump and everything he represents. This culture war extends backward, too. The destruction of artworks celebrating Christopher\u00a0Columbus, George\u00a0Washington, Abraham Lincoln and black and white abolitionists reveals a determination to erase America\u2019s founding ideals and replace individual liberty with socialism and\u00a0identity politics. The New York Times\u2019 error-ridden\u00a01619 Project, despite repudiation\u00a0by historians, is nonetheless being adopted by many schools. Biden, in public life for nearly 50 years, falls in line with his party\u2019s radical wing by insisting that \u201csystemic racism\u201d stains the nation,\u00a0especially law enforcement. Meanwhile, the spread of political violence and the refusal of many on the left to condemn Antifa\u00a0and those\u00a0who burn and loot\u00a0emboldens a new criminal class of anarchists. Shamefully, Democrats, the Times, The Washington Post, CNN and broadcast networks defend the unwarranted 2016 spying operation against Trump led by Jim Comey at the FBI, and approved by the\u00a0Obama-Biden White House. Although the top leaders of the storied agency were removed in disgrace, just one agent has been charged with a crime related to the dirtiest political trick in history. The outrageous endorsement by the media of the corruption of law enforcement and intelligence for partisan purposes is reason enough to vote for Trump. I believe much of the nation\u2019s discord can be traced to the Times\u2019 decision to become\u00a0an activist propaganda\u00a0sheet to defeat Trump. The most powerful influencer in the country, it has a trickle-down effect on nearly all media institutions. If The Gray Lady were to return to being a trusted source of news, others would follow and the country could return to more civil debates about our differences.

Voters in the Midwest should look closely at the state of Illinois before deciding who to vote for in this year's presidential election, Laura Ingraham said Thursday. \"The Ingraham Angle\" host opened her show by analyzing recent polls that show President Trump gaining ground in Florida and Arizona and tight races in many of the Midwest states that Joe Biden hopes to either keep in the Democratic column or take back from the incumbent. \"If Trump carries Florida,\u00a0North Carolina and Arizona,\u00a0along with the other states he\u00a0is already expected to win,\u00a0he'll have more than 250\u00a0electoral votes,\" Ingraham said. \"At that point, the only way for\u00a0Democrats to win would be to\u00a0sweep Pennsylvania and the Midwest with mail-in ballots.\" MORE THAN HALF A MILLION VOTES ALREADY CAST IN 2020 ELECTION \"After being the punch line for\u00a0liberal elites for years and\u00a0years, the Midwest finally has\u00a0its moment in 2020,\" the host said later in the segment.\u00a0\"If you're from Wisconsin and\u00a0you're an independent but\u00a0Trump's tweets bug you, OK, I\u00a0get it.\u00a0But focus on what matters:\u00a0Your family, their future, your\u00a0and their safety, and\u00a0prosperity.\" Ingraham described Trump's pre-pandmic economic record as \"irrefutable proof\" his policies work. On the other extreme, she added, there's Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B.

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) will mute\u00a0President Trump\u00a0and\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0during the\u00a0two-minute response times\u00a0allotted to their opponents\u00a0for commenting on topics during Thursday's debate in Nashville. The commission said in a statement that it \"had determined that it is appropriate to adopt measures intended to promote adherence to agreed-upon rules and inappropriate to make changes to those rules.\u201d Also included in the debate\u00a0will be an open discussion forum that won't include the mute option. Thursday\u2019s debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, totaling 90 minutes in all as in the first debate. Trump's and Biden's initial debate was widely panned as both candidates faced backlash for their behavior.\u00a0The two candidates skipped the second presidential debate after Trump was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and\u00a0declined to participate in a virtual format. Announced on Monday, the new rule\u00a0drew scrutiny from the Trump campaign, which urged the commission earlier in the day to include more discussion of foreign policy in the next debate. TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENDS LETTER TO DEBATE COMMISSION ASKING FOR MORE FOCUS ON FOREIGN POLICY \"President Trump is committed to debating Joe Biden regardless of last minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favored candidate,\" read a statement from campaign manager Bill Stepien In a letter, Stepien had accused the commission of\u00a0adding to a broader pattern of \"pro-Biden antics\" with its choice of topics.\u00a0The upcoming debate topics included fighting COVID-19, American families, national security, leadership, climate change, and race in America. The commission did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. The Biden campaign responded to Stepien's letter by suggesting that he was lying. \"The campaigns and the Commission agreed months ago that the debate moderator would choose the topics,\u201d National Press Secretary TJ\u00a0Ducklo said in a statement provided to Fox News. TRUMP TO PRESS BIDEN ON HUNTER BIDEN EMAIL STORIES IF DEBATE MODERATOR DOESN'T, ADVISER SAYS \u201cThe Trump campaign is lying about that now because\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0is afraid to face more questions about his disastrous COVID response. As usual, the president is more concerned with the rules of a debate than he is getting a nation in crisis the help it needs.\" But Ali Pardo, Deputy Communications Director for the Trump campaign, told Fox News that \"[o]ver the past several months, the CPD [Commission on Presidential Debates]\u00a0verbally confirmed on multiple occasions that the third debate would have a foreign policy focus.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., previously\u00a0suggested a \"mute\u00a0button\" would be necessary for another debate to take place. \"Maybe we should give the moderator a mute button, given how President Trump just interrupts at\u00a0will,\" Schumer said a day after the first debate. \"And the bottom line is Donald Trump doesn't follow the rules [and]\u00a0the commission has\u00a0got to get a lot tougher.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But\u00a0his counterpart in the House, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., argued a mute button gave the moderator too much power. \"If you are going to run for the\u00a0free leader of this world we\u00a0want to hear what you have to\u00a0say, but now we're going to allow one\u00a0person to moderate it to\u00a0determine what the American\u00a0people can hear from our\u00a0candidates?\" he previously said on \"Fox & Friends.\" Fox News' Brooke Singman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Fox News contributor Guy Benson reacts to the first night of the RNC, calls it a 'compelling night of television.' The spirit of America is a spirit of heroism: risking for others even if the ante is your life, never being broken no matter how hurt\u00a0you are, and fighting with a grin of determination that widens as the challenge you face grows. I know most Americans will never lose this spirit\u00a0no matter the obstacle,\u00a0but\u00a0I do believe that this November\u2019s election presents a clear choice between a vision of\u00a0big\u00a0government actively seeking to extinguish the flames of our heroic spirit\u00a0and a vision of limited government that looks to empower America\u2019s everyday heroes. Heroism is not found in the violent mobs looking to destroy our cities. Unity is not found in the hateful speech of Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Congressman Bobby Rush. Liberty is not found in the servitude of policies demanding Americans put their hand out to the government.\u00a0Morality is not found in denying the presence of God. SEN. TOM COTTON: AS PRESIDENT, BIDEN WOULD PANDER TO CHINA\u00a0\u2013 JUST LOOK AT HIS LIFELONG RECORD As a career Army bomb technician, I have seen real heroism in the Ranger warfighters I stalked Afghanistan with each night and in the injured combatants whom I healed alongside in Walter Reed Army Medical Center after losing the two legs God gave me. Following my injury, I met dozens of new recipients of the Purple Heart each month. Some of them were newly blinded but went on to become top Paralympic athletes. Some lost an arm and two legs.\u00a0Some, though burned across massive percentages of their body, had hundreds of surgeries so that they could continue to have a smile for everyone they met. A rare few lost all four limbs, and even now, they do not settle for just surviving, they fight every day to thrive. Some were men and some were women.\u00a0Some were officers and some enlisted.\u202fThey came from all different backgrounds\u00a0\u2013\u00a0various races, ethnicities and creeds. Their commonality was that they loved America enough to give their life for her, and knowing the sacrifices to their body, would still go back and do it all again to defend the spirit of our great nation. We all wake up as Americans each new day with the same opportunity. These heroes are examples of what Americans have always known. We are not glass statues. If we fall, we do not just shatter and break into hundreds of little pieces. We are resilient and gritty.\u00a0We are at our best when we are up against the worst. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER These heroes also show the world the power of liberty and true freedom. No matter the level of pain endured by the flesh and by the mind, we all wake up as Americans each new day with the same opportunity. We get to decide, for ourselves, that tomorrow is better than yesterday or this week is better than the last. That is the guarantee that comes with the freedom to govern ourselves, and it is this belief that underlies the Republican Party\u2019s vision for our nation. There is no bill, law or lawmaker that can make us more capable than our will alone because government has never been the spirit of America.\u00a0The spirit of America is the same as the spirit of heroism: service in pursuit of justice and sacrifice for causes bigger than ourselves. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, tonight as we reflect on our nation of heroes, let us remember that our country\u2019s spirit does not depend upon each of us sacrificing as the heroes of war did.\u00a0Rather, our country\u2019s spirit depends upon each of us knowing that the challenges we face have little significance compared to what we do personally when faced with great challenges. Above all,\u00a0let us remember\u00a0to be united in our determination to strive, to advance, to push and to achieve like no other! CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP. BRIAN MAST",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0A super PAC backing President Trump\u2019s re-election bid is taking aim at Joe Biden for what they say is the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s refusal to recognize \u201cthe threat\u00a0Antifa poses to American society.\u201d The outside group \u2013 the Committee to Defend the President \u2013 tells Fox News that it\u2019s launching a new ad-blitz in the crucial general election battleground of Arizona, a state Trump won four years ago but is currently trailing Biden according to the latest public opinion polls. BIDEN SAYS 'ANTIFA'S AN IDEA, NOT AN ORGANIZATION' The organization says they\u2019ll spend $1 million to run TV commercials statewide and an additional $100,000 to run the ads on digital. The ads are expected to start running this week and will air through the end of the month, the group says. One of the spots showcases Biden\u2019s comment from last month\u2019s first presidential debate that \u201cAntifa\u2019s an idea, not an organization.\u201d \u201cIdeas don\u2019t smash windows. Ideas don\u2019t wreck police cars. Ideas don\u2019t burn car dealerships, loot minority-owned businesses,\u201d the announcer in the commercial says. \u201cThe Antifa threat is real and must be stopped. If Joe Biden can\u2019t see the danger, he can\u2019t lead America.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments during the debate came when he was asked by the moderator \u2013 \"Fox News Sunday\"\u00a0anchor Chris Wallace \u2013 to condemn left-wing extremism. The former vice president appeared to be referencing comments earlier in September from FBI Director Christopher Wray, in which Wray said \u201cwe look at Antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization.\" But the FBI director added, \u201cto be clear we do have quite a number of properly predicated domestic terrorism investigations into violent anarchist extremists, any number of whom self-identify with the Antifa movement.\u201d The president last month introduced a plan that would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, something he had suggested doing in the past. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON ANTIFA Antifa \u2013 which traces its roots back 13 years ago to Portland, Ore. --\u00a0is a loose movement of far-left anti-fascist\u00a0activists. The name Antifa is an abbreviation of the phrase anti-fascist. Federal and local authorities say both Antifa followers, along with White supremacists, have been behind some of the violence and looting that\u2019s flared at protests against racial inequity that sprang up in cities across the country this spring and summer. The super PAC\u2019s second ad spotlights that \u201c13 Biden staffers contributed to bail fund that put violent protesters back on the street.\u201d The commercial is referring to reports that more than a dozen staffers on the Biden presidential campaign donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a nonprofit organization that pays criminal bail and cash bonds for those who cannot afford them. The fund grabbed national attention earlier this year after several celebrities donated to the group to bail out protesters arrested during demonstrations sparked by the death of Black man George Floyd while in the custody of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. At least 13 Biden staffers tweeted in May that they donated to the fund. Biden\u2019s team noted that the staffers made their contributions on their own and weren\u2019t organized by the campaign WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT THE BIDEN-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE The announcer in the commercial says that \u201ceven Kamala Harris pitches in.\u201d The announcer was\u00a0referring to a tweet from Sen. Kamala Harris of California in early June saying \u201cIf you\u2019re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota.\u201d The tweet by the senator came more than two months before she was named by Biden as his running mate. The Committee to Defend the President chairman Ted Harvey, in a statement, charged that \u201cfor months, Joe Biden has been cozying up to the radical Left, refusing to recognize the very real threat that Antifa poses to American society. Even worse, Biden\u2019s running mate, Kamala Harris, has personally raised money for a left-wing bail fund that put violent criminals back on the streets, while Biden staffers contributed to it. A vote for the Biden ticket is a vote for rioting, looting, and nationwide chaos.\u201d The super PAC says its spent more than $7 million on pro-Trump independent expenditures from the begining of the year through the end of September. Except for President Bill Clinton\u2019s victory in 1996, Arizona has been carried by the GOP in presidential elections since 1952. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney topped President Obama by 9 points in the state. But in 2016, Trump carried Arizona by just 3.5 points over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. An average of the latest public opinion polls in the state indicates Biden holding a single-digit edge over the president. Both campaigns have poured plenty of time and money into the state. Both Biden and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in-person in Arizona last Friday. Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report",

Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...Family describes violent attack by protesters at \u2018Jews for Trump\u2019 rally in New York CityA family of seven -- including four children -- said they were pepper-sprayed by violent rioters on Sunday while participating in a \u201cJews For Trump\u201d rally in New York City. A member of the family told Fox News that the unprovoked attack happened while the family was driving down Fifth Avenue\u00a0with the car windows down and Trump flags displayed. The man, who wished to remain anonymous, said a car pulled up next to them and unleashed pepper spray into their vehicle. \"Immediately the kids started crying and screaming and I jumped out of the car after I was peppered [sic] sprayed as well,\" the man said. The encounter was one of many violent confrontations between the rally's participants and protesters. The Jewish Telegraph Agency reported that a convoy was to take place in several Orthodox Jewish communities ahead of a planned event in Brooklyn\u2019s Marine Park organized by Boris Epshteyn, an advisor to the Trump campaign and co-chair of Jewish Voices for Trump.

If Barrett is confirmed to become a member of the highest bench in the country \u2013 and, with Republicans easily having enough votes to confirm her, that seems to be a foregone conclusion \u2013 one of the first cases she could hear as a new Supreme Court justice could decide who wins the White House. Courts at all levels have been deluged with cases relating to balloting in the run-up to Election Day \u2013 and amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic \u2013 but one, in particular, has garnered nation attention. With the possibility of Barrett, a conservative jurist, joining the bench and giving the Court a 6-3 conservative majority, Republicans are hopeful that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of ignoring the ballots received after Election Day. Democrats, on the other hand, are decrying Barrett\u2019s confirmation as a political act by President Trump to help him maintain the White House in a race that shows him consistently losing in the polls and as \u201cvoter suppression\u201d tactic.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Vocal conservative Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., over the weekend escalated his pressure on Republicans planning for a potential Supreme Court vacancy by declaring that he would not vote for any nominee who has not made clear they believe Roe v. Wade, the precedent that abortion is a constitutional right based on a right to privacy, was wrongly decided. \"I will vote only for those Supreme Court nominees who have explicitly acknowledged that\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0is wrongly decided,\" Hawley said.\u00a0\"By explicitly acknowledged, I mean on the\u00a0record and before they were nominated.\" AN INSIDE LOOK AT HOW TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT LIST IS MADE: 'A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT OF TIME' Hawley made the comments in an interview with the Washington Post that was published over the weekend. He previously said, according to Politico, that he was \"not wild about\" President Trump putting out another list of potential Supreme Court nominees in the model of his previous ones after a series of disappointing high court rulings for conservatives. One of those rulings,\u00a0on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was authored by Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"This last term at the Supreme Court has shown the Court is still stocked with judicial imperialists,\" a Hawley spokesperson told Fox News about why he is taking this stance now.\u00a0\"For years now, well before this President, the establishment promised religious conservatives a Supreme Court that would uphold the Constitution and protect their rights, and they\u2019ve failed to deliver. It\u2019s time to get serious about scrutinizing people\u2019s records.\" Hawley's comment about nominees being \"on the\u00a0record and before they were nominated\"\u00a0would, essentially, ensure they are not just taking their position after being chosen. Nominees also almost always play coy with their feelings on specific issues\u00a0in Senate committee hearings, in case that issue comes before them while on the bench. But judges commonly will comment on cases and issues in opinions, dissenting or otherwise, that they write as part of their jobs as federal judges, or in speeches or law review articles\u00a0before they assume\u00a0a judgeship. \"I don\u2019t want private assurances from candidates. I don\u2019t want to hear about their personal views, one way or another,\" he said, according to The Post.\u00a0\"I\u2019m not looking for forecasts about how they may vote in the future or [predictions.] I don\u2019t want any of that. I want to see on the record, as part of their record, that they have acknowledged in some forum that\u00a0Roe v. Wade, as a legal matter, is wrongly decided.\" Hawley said that he doesn't \"care who nominates\" a judge --\u00a0Trump or otherwise -- he will not vote for a judge who has not said Roe is wrongly decided. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch participates in taking a new \"family\" photo with his fellow justices at the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. Gorsuch has earned criticism from the right for his decision on a case involving Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which incorporated gay and transgender individuals into the law's protections against employment discrimination \"because of sex.\" SUPREME COURT DENIES NEVADA CHIRCH'S APPEAL OF ATTENDANCE RESTRICTION AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Hawley's comments express genuine disillusionment\u00a0that many conservatives feel -- that they've been burned multiple times by Supreme Court justices who are billed as conservatives when they are nominated and confirmed but then drift to the left as time goes on. Former Justice Anthony\u00a0Kennedy, previously a common swing vote, was the embodiment of this concern. Now, much of conservatives' ire is directed at the Bush-appointed Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and a suspicious eye is being cast toward Gorsuch. But Hawley's comments also risk creating a fracture in the Republican Party, and some GOP court watchers came out against his standard on Monday. Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas and one of the people involved in putting together Trump's new Supreme Court list, slated to be released before the end of the summer, spoke out on Twitter. \"I understand Senator Hawley\u2019s frustration, but his test would have excluded Justice Thomas and Justice Alito while allowing Justice Souter and Justice Kennedy,\" she said. With precedent and other factors, it's often been difficult to predict how justices will vote on abortion cases. Kennedy,\u00a0one of the authors of the Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling that in the early 1990s reaffirmed Roe, has been the subject of derision from conservatives over that case for years. But according to a\u00a0Los Angeles Times story from the time, he had previously called Roe the \"Dred Scott of our time.\" The Supreme Court in Dred Scott v. Sandford said\u00a0that Black people could not be American citizens, a ruling that contributed to the beginning of the Civil War. Newsweek opinion editor and legal commentator Josh Hammer, however,\u00a0argued that Severino was incorrect in saying that Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito had not condemned Roe before their appointments. IMPACT OF SUPREME COURT ON 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Hammer referenced a Southern California Law Review article which cited a working group Thomas was a part of\u00a0saying Roe was among \"'fatally flawed' rulings that should be 'corrected.'\"\u00a0On Alito, he cited a 2005 NPR story that dug up a memo Alito wrote while working in the Justice Department in 1985, saying that the Reagan administration \"should make clear that we disagree with Roe v. Wade.\" Hammer was previously a clerk for Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Trump-appointed Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge James Ho. But Mike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project, an organization that says it takes a\u00a0\"brass knuckles\" approach to supporting Trump judicial nominees, warned of the danger of conservatives wading into \"judicial-activism.\" JOHN YOO: DACA RULING GAVE TRUMP LICENSE TO ISSUE NEW POLICIES WITHOUT CONGRESS \"Parties before the court must get a fair shake \u2014 and not have their case decision precooked in a smoke-filled room in the Senate. If conservatives legitimize the judicial-activism game, we will lose that game much more often than not \u2014 as many of these liberal results are oftentimes politically popular,\" Davis said. \"It\u2019s certainly fair game for senators to question judicial nominees about their past decisions, speeches, and writings. And it\u2019s also fair game\u00a0for senators to ask judicial nominees how they\u2019ll go about deciding future cases \u2014 so long as they don\u2019t commit to the ultimate outcome of a case.\" Davis also pointed out that pro-choice swing-vote Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, would almost certainly not vote to confirm a nominee that has openly condemned Roe. But a spokesperson for Hawley said the senator is more concerned with ensuring the \"conservative movement\" accomplishes its goals. \"We\u2019ve all heard that argument for years,\" the spokesperson said. \"It\u2019s an excuse to nominate judges who don\u2019t have guts and who are secret judicial imperialists. If we cannot nominate someone to the Supreme Court who will acknowledge\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0was wrongly decided as a matter of constitutional law, then the conservative movement has not accomplished much.\" Additionally, Democrats have not been shy about applying litmus tests to judges -- according to a New York Times survey of Democratic presidential candidates, nearly every candidate in the 2020 primary, including presumptive nominee Joe Biden, said they would \"[r]equire judicial nominees to support Roe as settled law.\" Those close to the Trump Supreme Court list had previously criticized Hawley over his comments calling into question the Trump vetting process, which brought about Gorsuch -- a judge Hawley praised in a CNN op-ed at the time of his appointment -- and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Do you want the secretive process that brought us David Souter and John Roberts, or do you want the process President Trump has employed, a transparent accountable list that conservatives of all stripes can look at, comment on, and assess?\" one person involved in the vetting process, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about its inner workings, said. Severino said that \"anyone who doubts the transformation should consider the majorities of previous decades and ask themselves how many cases originalists were winning back then.\" There are no currently vacant seats on the Supreme Court, and despite rumors that\u00a0Alito or Thomas may retire, a person close to the court told Fox News this month that \"I would not bet a lot of money on either of those possibilities.\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is also in ill health, and has been undergoing chemotherapy for a \"recurrence of cancer,\" she said in a statement\u00a0this month. But the justice, who has beaten cancer on several other occasions, said that her current treatment is proving effective and\u00a0said\u00a0that she is still able to \"do the job full steam,\" quashing any rumors of her possible retirement for health reasons.",

More than 63 million people tuned in to watch the second and final presidential debate Thursday, a significant drop from the over 73 million who tuned in for the first debate, according to Nielsen Media Research. The decline in viewership could be due to the fact that many Americans have already made up their minds on their candidate of choice as more than 52.7 million people have already cast their votes, according to the U.S. Election Project. The U.S. has already recorded over 38 percent of the total ballots returned during the 2016 race, with the election still\u00a011 days out. A reduction in viewership for the final debate is not an unusual trend, though the drop in viewership from the last presidential cycle is significant. President Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had 71.6 million viewers tune into their final debate \u2013 an increase from the previous presidential debate between President Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s 67 million. The third and final debate during the 2008 presidential race between Obama and former Sen. John McCain only saw 56 million viewers. Fox News saw the highest rating Thursday night\u00a0with preliminary numbers showing 14.7 million viewers tuning in. ABC finished second with 10.8 million viewers, followed by NBC with 10.2 million. CNN finished fourth with 7.2 million viewers, MSNBC had 6.7 million people tune in and CBS finished bottom with 5.5 million viewers for the debate, reported The Hill\u00a0Friday. The final debate drew significantly more viewership than the dueling town halls the candidates held in lieu of the previously planned second presidential debate in mid-October. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Biden drew 14.1 million viewers during his town hall hosted by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, in comparison to Trump\u2019s town hall hosted by NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie, which brought in 13.5 million viewers. Biden currently is leading in the polls over Trump by 7.9 percent, though he is only projected to be leading in battleground states by 3.8 percent \u2013 a figure well within the margin of error.

            "article_content": "Democratic strategist Robert Patillo and analyst for Young Americans for Liberty Kristin Tate join the debate. America was treated to two different town halls Thursday night featuring Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Trump on different networks. Why weren't the two candidates appearing on stage together, you ask, just 19 days before the election? Because the Commission on Presidential Debates decided last week it wasn\u2019t safe to debate in person. Apparently, nobody told NBC's Town Hall moderator Savannah Guthrie, who couldn\u2019t have fought President Trump any harder on Thursday night if she were at the top of the Democratic ticket. Guthrie\u2019s constant interruptions stood in stark contrast to the spa treatment Joe Biden received from ABC moderator George Stephanopolous, who couldn\u2019t have made the Biden family feel more comfortable if he gave him a hot towel and spoke Ukrainian. (I hope you enjoyed that line because I\u2019ll probably get banned from Twitter for it.) DAN GAINOR: TRUMP\u2019S NBC TOWN HALL TURNS INTO DEBATE WITH MODERATOR \u2014 AND TRUMP WINS Let the record show that on a night when President Trump was asked about QAnon, an internet conspiracy many people have heard of but few can explain, his rival didn\u2019t face a single question about his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, which happens to be one of the biggest stories in the country despite the efforts of the big tech oligarchs to suppress it. I\u2019m not saying the Hunter Biden emails are true because I have no way of knowing at this juncture. But show me a man who thinks the candidates received equal treatment and I\u2019ll show you a way to take away his car keys for everyone\u2019s safety. Much can be said about the contrasting style of the moderators on Thursday night but what really jumped out at me was the contrasting leadership styles of the candidates and their dueling visions for our country. Trump comes off as a street fighter, whose nose for conflict has been hardened by four years of incessant attacks from a media hellbent on stopping his presidency at all costs. Biden has the auto-pilot charm of a lifelong politician. He campaigns like he\u2019s not interested in fighting for anything other than the TV remote when he\u2019s home on the plastic-covered couch with Jill. Trump pushes American excellence at every turn, as he did again Thursday night in touting the record-breaking unemployment numbers we enjoyed pre-pandemic for people of every socio economic background. Biden pushes systemic racism and class warfare, as he did in calling out America\u2019s troubled history with race and vowing to increase taxes on the rich yet again. In short, these Town Hall\u00a0events made it abundantly clear that 2020 is a choice between VICTOR-HOOD or VICTIM-HOOD. The Republicans unapologetically call this the greatest country the world has ever known. They rightfully point out that we live in an age where everyone can flourish through hard work thanks to the spectacular upward mobility in our society. No, we\u2019re not perfect. Yes we\u2019ve made immense progress in the last 50 years we should continue to build on. The Democrats devoted their entire presidential election cycle to telling us the rich have stacked the deck against us and the whole country is racist. If you believe this is true, you have to wonder why it took their candidate 47 years to realize it. But any way you slice it, the left is constantly scolding us for the America we were instead of giving us credit for all the work we\u2019ve done to become the America we are. For all the hysterical claims that President Trump poses an existential threat to our country, a Gallup poll released last week shows that 56% of Americans consider themselves better off now than they were four years ago, compared to 45% of American who felt that way at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s first term. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER When confronted with these findings during a campaign stop in Cincinnati, Biden said voters who feel that way \u201cshould probably vote for Trump\u201d adding, \u201cwell, their memory is not very good, quite frankly.\u201d Now to be fair, if anybody knows about having a bad memory, it\u2019s a presidential nominee who\u2019s told people he\u2019s running for Senate on multiple occasions. But Biden\u2019s dismissive attitude towards the facts is emblematic of the left\u2019s entire approach to fighting this president: push his rhetoric over his record. They continue to run this exhausted play because while the president throws tons of wild rhetorical pitches, he\u2019s had no problem finding the strike zone with his pro-growth agenda. Not only did he slash regulations at a staggering pace to get the bureaucratic boot off the neck of small businesses, but he cut taxes for 80% of Americans, with the biggest benefits being felt by women and minorities at the lowest end of the economic scale. Recently released Data from the Census Bureau shows that real median household income increased by $4,400 in 2019, which represents a 6.8% one-year increase - the largest one year increase on record! Those those gains have been highest for minority groups with real median income growing by 7.9 percent for Black Americans, 7.1 percent for Hispanic Americans, and 10.6 percent for Asian Americans. The pandemic induced lockdowns have driven down economic data in 2020. Even so, our unemployment rate has already dropped from 14.7% in April to the current rate of 7.9%, which is where it stood at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s second term. They\u2019ll be plenty of character assassinations and bombshell reports between now and November 3. Some of them will even be allowed to run on Twitter. But the real contrast facing voters as America picks itself up off the mat after a vicious right hook from the coronavirus is this: Do we want a president who campaigns relentlessly and never stops pushing an empowering message of American greatness? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Or do we want a president who\u2019s spent the vast majority of this campaign letting the media fight his defeatist, race-baiting \u201cbattle for the soul of our nation.\u201d I, for one , think the choice couldn\u2019t be clearer because if Thursday night\u2019s town halls showed us anything it\u2019s that the media can\u2019t be counted on to do its job, let alone a president\u2019s.

            "article_content": " Here's why a second Trump term is so important. 2016 was a populist revolution and ever since the establishment have\u00a0been desperate to get their power back. BOLTON, IN INTERVIEW, SAYS DEMOCRATS 'ALMOST AS BAD AND SOMEWHAT EQUIVALENT TO TRUMP' Russia, Mueller, impeachment -- the bureaucracy, the establishment media, the Democrats, never-Trump Republicans, John Bolton with his book -- they are desperate to show that Trump was a one-off, short-term event, a historical aberration. Joe Biden, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee: \"We can turn four years of Donald Trump into a historical aberration.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Amazing he could string two words together consistently. We have to show that Trump's election was not a short-term aberration, but the start of a long-term change to right the wrongs of the establishment's 50 years of failure. Their ideology of open borders, globalism and endless war devastated working people and the American dream. We can't go back to the Democrats or the establishment GOP. We must show that this is a new, enduring conservative populism -- pro-business on tax and regulation, and pro-worker on trade and immigration, pro-America on defense and pro-family on paid leave and tax credits. Conservative judges and criminal justice reform -- law and order and justice. We can't go back to the Democrats or the establishment GOP. We must show that this is a new, enduring conservative populism The need for this conservative populism was obvious before coronavirus, the shutdown and George Floyd. But now, the stakes in this election are even higher. The shutdown has destroyed the economy. The only way to rebuild it is with an aggressive, pro-growth agenda. The Democrats, they are off on Planet Pelosi with a mad pro-government agenda. We'd see sclerosis and slump that would make the 1970s look like the Reagan boom. The Black Lives Matter protests have highlighted the evil of racial inequality. The only way to reverse historical injustice is with a pro-opportunity agenda on education, housing, jobs, family, community and more. A Democrat win in 2020 would be a tragic setback for African-Americans. On top of that, we now know what kind of a leader Joe Biden would be. He wouldn't be a leader at all. He is a follower -- a weak, corrupt, mentally malfunctioning cipher, being pulled further to the left every week. Look at some of the people running his policy groups: AOC on climate change, Pramila Jayapal on health care, Marcia Fudge on education. The loony left will be the puppet masters of a Biden presidency. Here's the establishment scheme for November: Keep the House, take the Senate, take the White House and\u00a0then use unconstrained power not just to defeat Trump, but to crush the populist revolution. They will abolish the legislative filibuster so they only need a simple majority in the Senate. They'll use that to give statehood to D.C. and Puerto Rico for a permanent Senate majority. They'll gerrymander\u00a0districts in 2021 to shut Republicans out of power in Washington and state capitals. And they will pack the Supreme Court to gain permanent control of the judicial branch, destroying the Constitution and giving unlimited power to the administrative state. You think this kind of establishment fascism couldn't happen here? President Trump has driven them all crazy. It will happen here\u00a0unless he wins. To do that, the Trump campaign needs a new message and a clear plan for the second term. In 2016, Donald Trump promised change for the victims of establishment failure. He did that with historically low unemployment and high earnings growth for the lowest-paid workers and especially for African-Americans, for whom he also delivered criminal justice reform, opportunity zones and record investment in HBCUs. President Trump can meet this moment and win over the voters he needs in 2020 with a new message of change for people who've been left behind -- equal opportunity for Americans of every race. Make America great again for all. To support that message, the president needs clear, simple policy ideas on the four big issues that will swing votes in November. On jobs, the economy and immigration, American workers first. On China, time to bring manufacturing home and decouple our economies.

Sign up\u00a0here.**On the roster: Where it\u2019s at - Trump tries to kneecap Fauci as corona woes worsen - Trump builds behemoth campaign - Senate Republicans face fundraising panic - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles strike againWHERE IT\u2019S ATThe 2016 election was the biggest upset in presidential politics in generations \u2013 truly one for the history books.So it's not surprising that such a remarkable event would profoundly change the way we perceive the current partisan struggle. In fact, may in politics and public life have over-learned the lessons of 2016 and used them to reach unusual conclusions.\nEditors dispatched so many reporters to Appalachian and Rust Belt destinations, no diner or coffee shop could have been considered safe for the peaceful enjoyment of either biscuit or bear claw. It would be enough to make one forget that it was his success with suburban voters \u2013 about half of the electorate \u2013 that did more to make\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0president than with any other group.Twitter frothed and foamed so much over the rise of Democratic Socialism that it seemed like the Green New Deal would have been just for openers. It was hard to remember that\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a0success in 2016 said a lot more about\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0than it did about him.But, as we prepare to start the final 16 weeks of the 2020 contest, it will be helpful to check our progress this time against that of four years ago.Given how much has transpired since then and with the pressures of another presidential campaign at midpoint, we are apt to forget how things shaped up in 2016 \u2013 before civil unrest, before the pandemic, before impeachment\u2026So, let\u2019s refresh a bit.At this point four years ago, the Republican convention was just getting underway in Cleveland. The delegates supporting Sen.\u00a0Ted Cruz\u00a0and others trying to pry the nomination away from\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0tried an opening-night revolt. Tensions on the convention floor ran high as Team Trump, led by\u00a0Paul Manafort, looked to crack down on dissent. Just 38 percent of Republicans surveyed in a pre-convention poll for the Wall Street Journal said they were satisfied with Trump as their nominee.Democrats were getting ready for their own convention headaches. Sanders had given his endorsement to presumptive Democratic nominee Clinton only\u00a0a few days before and had done so in grudging fashion. The question wasn\u2019t whether Sanders and his crew would make the following week in Philadelphia unhappy, but how bad it would be. And the same poll showed that half of all voters said her email abuses showed she didn\u2019t have the right judgment to be president.It was a race like pollsters had never seen. Both candidates were broadly unpopular and enjoyed little public trust. The race had already settled into a rut from which it would never really emerge.In an average of the five most recent properly conducted national polls at this point in 2016, Clinton led by 3.8 points \u2013 44.8 percent to 41 percent. Less than 4 points is not a very big lead, especially in July. Of all the public polls taken in June and July of that year, Trump was ahead or tied with Clinton in half of them.The narrowness of the race was even more obvious by looking at swing-state polls. In Florida, the largest battleground state, Clinton led by a small but steady margin similar to her national advantage. In Ohio, which has picked the winner of every presidential contest since 1960, the race was dead even in an average of good polls.Both parties were divided and both candidates were viewed unfavorably, but Democrats believed that their small edge would prove durable enough to deliver a third term for the party. With a favorable Senate map and a strong cash advantage, it had the makings of a good year for the blue team.Republicans, though, looked to both the surprisingly stout victory in Britain for leaving the European Union as well as Trump\u2019s unlikely nomination victory itself as evidence that there was populist revolt taking place among working-class white voters that would carry Trump to victory.So where are we now?As for conventions, it\u2019s still not clear what\u2019s going to happen. The quadrennial mega rallies were first postponed because of coronavirus concerns. Now, with a month before the Democrats are supposed to kick off in Milwaukee, things are still in flux.While the Dems seem to have settled on a mostly-virtual event,\u00a0Republicans have already switched cities once \u2013 from Charlotte to Jacksonville \u2013 in search of a venue that will allow a large-scale indoor gathering. As Florida succumbs to a massive coronavirus outbreak, though, the red team may yet change its plans again.The good news for both parties is that they are substantially more unified than they were four years ago.Onetime Republican dissidents like Cruz are among the most abject in their support for Trump, who enjoyed an 87 percent job approval rate among Republicans in the most recent Fox News poll. Trump is now about as popular among members of his party as the previous Republican president,\u00a0George W. Bush, was at this point in his re-election bid.As for Sanders and the Democrats, despite the Vermont socialist\u2019s far better showing in key primaries this cycle than four years ago, he has abandoned even token resistance. After presumptive nominee\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0smashed him in a series of contests starting in South Carolina, Sanders quit the race early and instructed his delegates to make no trouble. A recent poll conducted for the New York Times found that 87 percent of battleground state voters who backed Sanders in the primary are all in for Biden with just 4 percent defecting to Trump \u2013 a far cry from the mass defections of 2016.One place where the 2016 and 2020 do seem very much alike at this point is in their consistency.In an average of the five most recent properly conducted national polls, Biden leads Trump by an average of 9.6 points, 51 percent to 41.4 percent. While Biden has added a bit to his lead in recent weeks, he had long enjoyed an advantage of about double what Clinton did in 2016. And steadily so.In nearly 100 national public opinion surveys of all types taken this year, Trump led in only one. He hasn\u2019t been ahead in a kosher poll since mid-December.The most important swing states tell a somewhat better story for Trump, albeit with scant data \u2013 due to limited polling in a year of coronavirus coverage. In two recent sound polls conducted in Florida, Biden has an average lead of 6.5 points while Ohio looks a lot like July 2016 with a 1-point race.Democrats believe that Republicans are on the verge of an epic wipeout and have pressed their advantage by not just targeting states that have been solidly red for years like Arizona, Texas and Georgia but by making a play for the Senate. Despite being snake bit by their unexpected 2016 loss, Democrats are starting to think big.Republicans now acknowledge that their current situation is grim, but rightly point out that 16 weeks is still a long time in political terms. What they can\u2019t figure out is how to start climbing out of the hole. While Trump is focused on the same kind of culture war struggles that energize his base, he has yet to find a way to drag Biden down to a point where Trump could pull off another upset.That\u2019s why you can bet that things will get much, much nastier from here on.THE RULEBOOK: LOOK AROUND, LOOK AROUND\u201cThe door ought to be equally open to all; and I trust, for the credit of human nature, that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of State legislation\u2026\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 36TIME OUT: TODAY IN GEN X HISTORYHistory: \u201cOn July 13, 1985, at Wembley Stadium in London,\u00a0Prince Charles\u00a0and\u00a0Princess Diana\u00a0officially open Live Aid, a worldwide rock concert organized to raise money for the relief of famine-stricken Africans.

Fauci, over the weekend, anonymously providing details to various news outlets about statements he had made early in the coronavirus outbreak that they said were inaccurate. The move to treat Dr. Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for decades, as if he were a warring political rival came as he has grown increasingly vocal in his concerns about the national surge in coronavirus cases, as well as his lack of access to Mr. Trump over the past several weeks. \u2026 And it came just days after the White House called school reopening guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overly restrictive, part of a pattern of the administration trying to sideline recommendations that could slow the reopening of the economy, which Mr. Trump views as vital to his flailing re-election effort.\u201dFellow task force member takes potshot -\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201cOne of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force members said Sunday that infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci doesn\u2019t necessarily \u2018have the whole national interest in mind\u2019 in suggesting responses to the pandemic. Fauci, who\u2019s also on the task force, \u2018looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,\u2019 Admiral\u00a0Brett Giroir, assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, said on NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 \u2018He admits that.\u2019 The comments reflected tension in the administration between the goal of tamping down transmission of Covid-19 as much as possible and Trump\u2019s desire to boost the economy, now in recession, before the November election. Giroir spoke as the U.S. continues to post record daily cases, especially in Sun Belt states. Florida on Sunday reported more than 15,000 new cases, the highest for any state -- including New York when it was the epicenter of the pandemic in the spring.\u201dMore big school districts opt out of in-person classes -\u00a0NYT: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s two largest public school districts said Monday that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enroll some 825,000 students, are the largest so far in the country to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. More than a third of California\u2019s coronavirus cases are in Los Angeles County, and San Diego County has had 18 community outbreaks over the past week, more than double the state\u2019s acceptable threshold.\u00a0 The joint announcement came as Education Secretary\u00a0Betsy DeVos\u00a0continued to press the Trump administration\u2019s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students\u2019 social and emotional development, but also to allow parents to return to work fully.\u201dPrice tag for school reopening could be astronomical -\u00a0The Hill: \u201cCongress is under growing pressure to provide billions of dollars to help schools reopen as part of the next coronavirus aid package while debate rages nationwide over whether it\u2019s safe to send students and teachers back to classrooms. Democrats and Republicans are increasingly in agreement that education funding will be a key part of the negotiations this month for a trillion-plus aid package. But divisions are emerging over how the funds should be allocated directly to K-12 public schools or through special vouchers for parents. Without the funding, education groups warn that schools won\u2019t have adequate protective gear, cleaning and ventilation systems needed to keep students, teachers and staff safe in line with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\u201dAs Congress debates new aid to states, a fight over previous package -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cA $150 billion federal program designed to help states, cities and counties respond to the coronavirus pandemic has pit some governments against each other, forcing them to scrap over the fast-dwindling, limited aid. The fight has intensified as Congress and the White House near deadlines to decide the scope of the next round of coronavirus relief. State and local leaders have demanded between $500 billion and $1 trillion in new assistance, but the vast uncertainty surrounding the initial tranche of funding has fueled accusations that money is being misspent or hoarded. The funds were supposed to help local governments purchase personal protective equipment, pay first responders and cover other public-health costs related to the pandemic. But restrictions in how the aid can be used, and confusion around how it is supposed to be doled out, mean that many have struggled to take full advantage of the so-called Coronavirus Relief Fund four months after Democrats and Republicans authorized it.\u201dTRUMP BUILDS BEHEMOTH CAMPAIGNAP: \u201cThe Republican National Committee and President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign say they have now hired 1,500 field staffers, aiming to convert their financial advantage over Democrats into votes in November. Trump Victory, the joint field effort of the two organizations, announced Monday the hiring of an additional 300 staffers set to hit 20 target states by Wednesday in the largest field operation ever mounted by a Republican. The goal is to turn out votes on behalf of Republicans up and down the ticket this fall. The Trump team says it is on pace to eclipse the 2.2 million volunteer total that helped reelect President Barack Obama in 2012. The announcement comes as public and private polls show Trump trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden across key battleground states and nationally. The president\u2019s team argues that polls also showed Trump down in 2016 but he nonetheless pulled off a win.\u201dTrump super PAC spends big in Ariz., N.C., Pa., and Wisc. -\u00a0Axios: \u201cAmerica First Action, a leading pro-Trump super PAC, will focus on Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in a $23 million anti-Biden summer ad campaign beginning next week. The ad buy signals which swing states the groups sees as most vulnerable for President Trump. Arizona and Wisconsin were not included earlier this year in the core battleground strategy. One PAC official tells Axios North Carolina and Arizona may be the tightest of these. The ads, to begin July 24 and continue through Labor Day, will serve as a bridge before the Trump campaign's planned $100 million advertising blitzkrieg that will begin in September and run through the election. The majority will be spent on broadcast (52%) and cable television (17%). Digital (14%) and mail resources (14%) also will be deployed.\u201dWith convention options dwindling, it\u2019s up to Trump -\u00a0AP: \u201cAfter months of insisting that the Republican National Convention go off as scheduled despite the pandemic, President Donald Trump is slowly coming to accept that the late August event will not be the four-night infomercial for his reelection that he had anticipated. After a venue change, spiking coronavirus cases and a sharp recession, Trump aides and allies are increasingly questioning whether it\u2019s worth the trouble, and some are advocating that the convention be scrapped altogether. \u2026 Ultimately, the decision on whether to move forward will be Trump\u2019s alone. \u2026 Still, Trump and his aides had pinned their hopes on creating the pageantry of a formal acceptance speech in Jacksonville, envisioning an arena of packed with supporters, without face masks. Outwardly, the White House and the RNC have said they\u2019re full-steam ahead with the revised plan.\u201dMishkin: Trump needs more than his base -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cRather than trying to appeal to centrist voters \u2014 moderate Republicans, independents and moderate Democrats \u2014 to widen his base of support, Trump is doubling down on his most extreme positions in an effort to boost turnout by his most fervent supporters in November. \u2026 While these hardline positions may be pleasing to many voters in Trump\u2019s base, the president\u2019s base alone is not big enough to reelect him. As a result, Trump is giving Biden a wide swath of the ideological landscape to harvest \u2014 from the far left to some parts of the center-right. November is still a long time from now in politics, but at this point polls suggest Trump\u2019s strategy will result in Biden\u2019s election in a landslide that could also give Democrats control of the Senate as well as the House. The Democrats have thus far successfully made the campaign into a referendum on Trump \u2014 and Trump has fallen into the trap of giving them plenty of arguments to use against him.\u201dSENATE REPUBLICANS FACE FUNDRAISING PANICPolitico: \u201cLast month, the National Republican Senatorial Committee prepared a slideshow for Senate chiefs of staff full of bleak numbers about the party's failure to compete with Democrats on digital fundraising. \u2026 The slideshow, obtained by POLITICO, painted a grim picture of the GOP\u2019s long-running problem. Republican senators and challengers lagged behind Democrats by a collective $30 million in the first quarter of 2020, a deficit stemming from Democrats\u2019 superior online fundraising machine. Since then, Democrats' fundraising pace accelerated further, with the party\u2019s challengers announcing huge second-quarter hauls last week, largely driven by online donors giving through ActBlue, the party\u2019s preferred fundraising platform. The money guarantees Democrats nothing heading into November 2020. But with President Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers sagging and more GOP-held Senate races looking competitive, the intensity of Democrats\u2019 online fundraising is close to erasing the financial advantage incumbent senators usually enjoy. That\u2019s making it harder to bend their campaigns away from the national trend lines \u2014 and helping Democrats\u2019 odds of flipping the Senate.\u201dGRAHAM READIES MUELLER SHOWDOWNBloomberg: \u201cSenator\u00a0Lindsey Graham\u00a0is preparing to invite former Special Counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller\u00a0to testify before a Senate panel about the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to a spokesperson for the panel\u2019s Republican majority. Graham of South Carolina, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted earlier that he would grant a prior request by Democrats on the panel -- made in 2019 -- for Mueller to appear. He\u2019s been hinting at such a move for some time as a way to grill Mueller about the origins of the Russian probe and what many Republicans see as bias against President Donald Trump by the nation\u2019s law enforcement agencies. Two days earlier Graham described the Mueller investigation as having been \u2018biased and corrupt.\u2019 Graham finally acted after the publication on Saturday of an opinion piece in the Washington Post, in which Mueller defended his efforts against \u2018broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper.\u2019\u201dMueller outlines Stone crimes -\u00a0AP: \u201cFormer special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of \u2018paramount importance\u2019 and asserting that a Trump ally,\u00a0Roger Stone, \u2018remains a convicted felon, and rightly so\u2019 despite the president\u2019s decision to commute his prison sentence. The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller\u2019s first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defense of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president\u2019s extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.\u201dJudge wants to know if Trump wants Stone to skip fine, probation -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cA federal judge on Monday ordered the government to explain the \u2018scope\u2019 of President Trump\u2019s commutation of longtime GOP operative Roger Stone, including whether the move only involved the sentence of incarceration, or also the period of supervised release. U.S. District Judge\u00a0Amy Berman Jackson\u00a0ordered the government to provide the court by Tuesday, July 14, \u2018a copy of the Executive Order commuting the defendant\u2019s sentence and to address the question of the scope of the commutation, in particular, whether it involves the sentence of incarceration alone or also the period of supervised release.\u2019 In February, Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison, along with 24 months of supervised release and a $20,000 fine.\u201dRomney, Toomey denounce Trump's commutation of Stone -\u00a0Politico: \u201cSens.\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0and\u00a0Pat Toomey\u00a0condemned Donald Trump\u2019s decision to commute the prison sentence of his longtime confidant Roger Stone \u2014 the first elected Republicans to denounce the president\u2019s Friday night move. \u2018Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,\u2019 Romney (R-Utah) wrote on Twitter Saturday. GOP lawmakers have been mostly silent about the commutation\u2026 In a statement, Toomey (R-Pa.) noted that the president \u2018clearly has the legal and constitutional authority to grant clemency for federal crimes,\u2019 but said commuting Stone\u2019s sentence was a \u2018mistake\u2019 due in part to the severity of the charges against him.\u201dWHAT TO WATCH IN TUESDAY\u2019S PRIMARIESRoll Call: \u201cVoters in three states will head to the polls Tuesday to decide the matchups in a trio of competitive Senate races and a slew of House contests. Primaries in Maine, and primary runoffs in Texas and Alabama, were initially delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Campaigns in Texas and Alabama have also had to navigate a recent spike in COVID-19 cases. Tuesday\u2019s primaries may follow a common theme in 2020: waiting on results. In Maine, not only will more voters cast their ballots by mail, but the state uses ranked-choice voting, which could further delay results in the competitive three-way Republican primary in the 2nd District. Under the ranked-choice system, voters order candidates from most to least favorite. If no one gets over 50 percent outright, then the last-place finisher is eliminated, with his or her votes reallocated to the other candidates based on the voters\u2019 second choices. This repeats until someone crosses 50 percent. Counting in a race that requires ranked-choice voting would extend beyond election night.\u201dSessions faces judgment day -\u00a0NYT: \u201cFor a moment, the whole room was on his side. \u2026 But then, as Mr. [Jeff]\u00a0Sessions\u00a0turned to his brief tenure as\u00a0President Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2026 his momentum, as it so often did at this juncture of his stump speech, sputtered. \u2026 It was the kind of abrupt tonal shift in crowd reaction that Mr. Sessions has faced time and again in his long-shot bid to reclaim his old Senate seat, which will be decided Tuesday in a runoff election between Mr. Sessions and his Republican opponent,\u00a0Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach. \u2026 The runoff seems destined to be a final word of sorts on the yearslong Sessions-Trump melodrama, with Alabama Republicans refereeing between a native son and a president they admire. \u2026 With polls showing Mr. Tuberville ahead of Mr. Sessions, who won four Senate elections and served from 1997 to 2017, Tuesday\u2019s runoff will also serve as a preview of voter attitudes in a deeply Republican state ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid in November.\u201dThe high price of virus voting -\u00a0AP: \u201cThe demand for mail-in ballots is surging. Election workers need training. And polling booths might have to be outfitted with protective shields during the COVID-19 pandemic. As officials prepare for the Nov. 3 election, one certainty is clear: It\u2019s coming with a big price tag. \u2018Election officials don\u2019t have nearly the resources to make the preparations and changes they need to make to run an election in a pandemic,\u2019 said\u00a0Wendy Weiser, head of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s democracy program. \u2018We are seeing this all over the place.\u2019 The pandemic has sent state and local officials scrambling to prepare for an election like few others, an extraordinary endeavor during a presidential contest, as virus cases rise across much of the U.S. COVID-19-related worries are bringing demands for steps to make sure elections just four months away are safe. But long-promised federal aid to help cash-starved states cope is stalled on Capitol Hill.\u201dThousands of mail-in ballots rejected for tardiness -\u00a0NPR: \u201cMail-in voting, which tens of millions of Americans are expected to use this November, is fraught with potential problems. Hundreds of thousands of ballots go uncounted each year because people make mistakes, such as forgetting to sign the form or sending it in too late. An NPR analysis has found that in the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they arrived past the deadline, often through no fault of the voter. While the numbers are relatively small \u2014 around 1% in most states \u2014 they could prove crucial in a close election, especially one in which many more voters are expected to cast absentee and mail-in ballots to avoid going to the polls during a pandemic.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYWho\u2019s wearing a mask and who isn\u2019t\u00a0-\u00a0GallupChina slaps Cruz, Rubio, others with sanctions for efforts to end concentration camps\u00a0-\u00a0APAUDIBLE: HELLO, 2013?

I usually vote for the more conservative candidate which is usually Republican, and I did begrudgingly vote for Trump in 2016 (couldn\u2019t vote for Hillary because I really think she was/is crooked).\u00a0 My conundrum now is what to do since I\u2019m not sure I can back what Trump has done to the presidency. I thought Obama was a narcissist, but Trump takes it to a new level.\u00a0 I guess you can count me into what people deride as the \u2018Squishy middle,\u2019 but I relish in my open mindedness to different approaches of government. I feel until we can embrace our squishiness, we can\u2019t compromise and get to a common respect for one another and move away from the disgusting rhetoric we see from both sides of the extremes. Time for the \u2018Squishy middle\u2019 to rise up against the extremes and bring some calm, common sense to government at all levels.\u00a0 Thing is, can this happen by just voting for Biden and removing Trump? Thanks in advance for your advice.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Trent Aschliman, Ossian, Ind.\n[Ed. note: In a word, no. I don\u2019t want to suggest that how you vote doesn\u2019t matter, but these bloody partisan wars in which America now finds itself trapped will not be resolved by anyone running for president this year. Trump is promising to wage this conflict with even greater intensity and promises his supporters that he will lead them to victory. But nobody \u2018wins\u2019 a culture war. What happens is that the conflict changes the battlefield, but nothing is resolved. Issue sets change but it basically comes down to the fact that we have deep divisions along economic and cultural/geographic/racial lines and the tribes will always find ways to be in combat. Fighting each other is what gives the groups real definition and Trump is promising four more years of war. Biden, on the other hand, promises to ratchet back the partisan intensity. He\u2019s striking moderate poses, reaching out to Republicans and promises something of a unity government. I doubt he could deliver any such thing. If elected, Biden will quickly find Republicans recoiling from his hand given the pressure of primary elections. That would leave him hostage to a Democratic Party that is increasingly radical and make more likely a resumption of the conflict at least at the Obama-era levels. You should feel free to vote for whomever you like, or not to vote or to write in\u00a0Philo T. Farnsworth\u00a0with confidence that none of the candidates can solve the problem. What will help solve the problem is an attitudinal shift in which voters line up for institutional reforms for the way we select nominees and conduct the business of government. I am reminded of the old joke. Two guys open up their lunch pails and one guy says, \u201cUgh. Tuna salad again.\u201d His friend says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell your wife to stop packing you tuna?\u201d He retorts \u201cHey, I pack my own lunch!\u201d We keep making our own meals but still act surprised at how they turn out. Until Americans are ready for real reform, no individual will end the fight.]\n\u201cI love the Halftime Report and I\u2019ll Tell You What is my favorite podcast. Your Roquefort dressing recipe is out of the world good! I was hoping to get your take on\u00a0Corey Gardner's chances of winning reelection?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tyler Swirka, Buena Vista, Colo.\n[Ed. note: I cannot offer Senator Gardner very much in the way of hope at this point. In 2016 for the first time ever there were no states that elected senators of a different party than their presidential preference. The Senate elections were thoroughly nationalized, continuing a trend that has been with us for a couple of decades. Joe Biden is right now on track to win Colorado by something more than 15 points. While I expect Gardner to outperform Trump in Colorado, that\u2019s a delta so wide that few freshman senators could ever dream of closing. Unless Trump gets back in the game, Gardner looks like a down-ballot casualty. The good news is that he can enjoy a tangy and creamy Roquefort dressing any time he likes since I\u2019m going to commit the Wheeling-style sauce to pixels here and now. INGREDIENTS: 2 tbsp sugar (or equivalent), 1 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 dashes nutmeg,\u00a04 tbsp Heinz ketchup, 2 tbsp cider vinegar, 1 cup mayonnaise (Hellman\u2019s or Dukes), \u00bc pound sharp and stinky Roquefort cheese, crumbled. TO PREPARE: Combine all ingredients except for mayo and cheese into a deep red slurry of smooth consistency. Whisk in the mayonnaise and adjust for taste and color. It should be tangy and very lightly sweet and the color of a 2-year-old flamingo -- a pale pink coral color. Fold the cheese in gently and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES STRIKE AGAINFox News: \u201cA crook looking for some dough got served up something else when trying to hold up a pizza shop in Delaware on Friday. Delaware State Police said they are searching for a man who attempted to rob Stargate Pizza in Sussex County, and only fled after the owner flung pizza at him. Officials said they received a call about the incident in Greenwood at 10:30 p.m. The owner told troopers that while he was closing his business for the night, a man with a machete approached him and demanded money. \u2018The store owner advised the suspect that he did not have any money and threw a pizza at him, causing the suspect to flee,\u2019 state police said.

            "article_content": "'Hannity' 2020 election correspondent Lawrence Jones talks to supporters of the president outside Omaha rally We are in a fight for the future of our country. Arizona is the pivotal battleground that will decide whether we continue on a path to recovery, growth, opportunity, and freedom \u2014 or careen in the opposite direction: shutting our country down, increasing job-killing taxes and regulations, and putting the government in control of our lives. This fundamental choice is what is on the ballot in Arizona and across the country. That is why I\u2019m asking my fellow Arizonans to reelect President Trump and send me back to the Senate to keep Republicans in majority control. Before the first-in-a-century coronavirus pandemic hit, our economy was in after-burner. We had record-low unemployment in nearly every demographic. Some 70% of new jobs last year went to women. BUZZ ALDRIN PICKS ARIZONA REPUBLICAN MCSALLY OVER FELLOW ASTRONAUT KELLY This didn\u2019t happen by chance. President Trump and congressional Republicans cut taxes and rolled back regulations imposed by\u00a0the Barack Obama-Joe Biden administration that stifled growth. On average, a middle-income family saved $2,000 on its annual tax bill as a result. We created Opportunity Zones that encouraged businesses to invest in underserved communities, creating job opportunities and revitalization. We incentivized businesses to bring home jobs from overseas and reshore manufacturing. When the result is more jobs and more money in the pockets of Americans working hard to achieve the American Dream, it\u2019s clear that what we did worked. As we\u2019re recovering from the devastating impact of the pandemic, we need more of these pro-growth policies to rebuild and propel our economy forward. But former Vice President Joe Biden, my Democratic opponent in my Senate race Mark Kelly, and the Democrats are calling for the exact opposite. Biden, Kelly and other Democrats want to undo our tax cuts and implement the largest tax increase in modern history. A recent study showed that the Biden economic plan would decrease household income by $6,500 and result in the loss of 5 million jobs. Those tax increases are in part attributable to the Democratic plan to have the government take over health care. Their bureaucratic plan would mean more red tape, worse care, and higher costs. Republicans and Democrats agree that we will always protect people with preexisting conditions, but when someone with a preexisting condition can\u2019t afford their health insurance, that isn\u2019t protecting them. While we are working to bring down costs and provide more choices, transparency and competition, the Biden-Kelly plan would end Medicare as we know it, kick 178 million Americans off their health insurance, and close rural hospitals. So many families and small business owners in Arizona and across the country need a better solution to this broken system. The only thing Democrats are interested in doing is using lies and scare tactics for political gain. They continue to push their failed, radical agenda, and this extremism comes at a real cost to Arizona families. Mark Kelly delivers a lot of empty platitudes about being an \u201cindependent,\u201d but his record tells a very different story. Just like Joe Biden, Kelly\u2019s weak-on-China record would make America less safe and less prosperous. Kelly personally recruited Chinese-government-tied Tencent to invest in a company he co-founded. This type of investment has been widely criticized by the national security community, yet he has doubled down on his business relationship with China. Over the last decade, Kelly also built one of the most sophisticated political organizations in the country, aimed squarely at infringing on our Second Amendment rights. He spent $57 million supporting the most radical Democrats, including Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Adam Schiff of California, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California \u2014 in addition to others. Kelly\u2019s group rated California an \u201cA\u201d for its gun control policy, while giving Arizona an \u201cF.\u201d Anyone who wants to make Arizona more like California has no business representing us in the Senate. Just this week, the Senate confirmed Amy Coney Barrett, a highly qualified mom of seven, to the Supreme Court. Kelly said he would have voted \u201cno\u201d on her confirmation \u2014 before even hearing a single word out of her mouth at the confirmation hearing. While we\u2019ve built nearly 400 new miles of a border wall system that keeps Arizona safe under the Trump administration, Kelly and the Democrats would throw open our borders. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER We are supporting and defending our brave law enforcement officers, while Kelly has embraced and tolerated the most hateful rhetoric that encourages attacks on our police. It\u2019s no surprise that the National Border Patrol Council and the Arizona Police Association have endorsed me and President Trump, because they know we have their backs. The contrast in this race couldn\u2019t be clearer and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Implementing the disastrous Democratic agenda while shutting down the country again would be a devastating combination for the millions of Arizonans who have poured their life savings into building their own small businesses. It would be devastating to the working moms who are forced to stay home longer because Democrats would keep schools and day care centers closed.

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence joins 'Fox &amp; Friends' to share his reaction to the Democratic National Convention. Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0in a Friday interview\u00a0framed the upcoming presidential election as a choice on the issues, drawing a contrast between what he said is President Trump's \"law and order\" and pro-economy agenda versus a\u00a0\"radical left\" agenda he said is supported by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris. Pence's message after the final night of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and ahead of the Republican National Convention (RNC) was the exact opposite of\u00a0how Democrats portrayed the election this week -- as a choice about the character of the two candidates.\u00a0Pence acknowledged as much in his Friday comments, which came in an interview with \"Fox & Friends.\" \"Joe Biden said last night ... democracy is on the ballot, character is on the ballot,\" Pence told the morning show's hosts, before laying out what he said the election was all about. \"The economy is on the ballot. Law and order is on the ballot. And the American people know it.... the contrast with what Joe Biden and the Democrats are offering is astonishing.\" Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, Thursday, Aug. 20, 2020, at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) BIDEN'S POLICY AGENDA TAKES BACKSEAT AS DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION SPEAKERS HAMMER TRUMP ON CHARACTER Pence said that Biden would \"raise taxes on the American people by $4 trillion, to advance a $2 trillion version fo the 'Green New Deal.'\" He continued to say\u00a0that the Democratic nominee's policies, which he said were \"overtaken by the radical left\" would \"simply invite more violence and more mayhem in our streets.\" He added that \"there was so much negativity, nothing but ad hominem attacks\" and \"a very negative view of America\" at the DNC. Policy certainly took a back seat for much of the DNC. A Fox News analysis of the first two nights of the convention found that\u00a0speakers referenced Biden's character (overwhelmingly favorably)\u00a0294\u00a0times and Trump's character (overwhelmingly unfavorably) 96 times. Meanwhile, convention speakers referenced Biden's policies 120 times and Trump's 56 times. Biden has repeatedly said the election as \"a battle for the soul of America,\" and Democrats' focus on character during the convention furthered that message. But Republicans, including Pence Friday morning, have accused Democrats of trying to obscure just how far left their platform is by putting such an emphasis on the morality, or lack thereof, of the two candidates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Senator\u00a0Kamala Harris is a California liberal who had the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate in 2019,\" Pence said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"And her selection as Joe Biden's running mate just confirmed everything President Trump and I have been saying all along -- that Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left.\" Pence added that he is \"looking forward to\" his upcoming debate against Harris \"more than I can tell you.\" With 74 days remaining until the presidential election, the Trump campaign will get its time in the spotlight with a four-day convention next week before the campaign enters its final mad dash to the finish, with three debates between Trump and Biden, and one between Pence and Harris.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence shares his thoughts on the Biden-Harris ticket. This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" August 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And tonight, as we speak, fake news outlets all over the country, they are drooling over Kamala Harris. They are singing her praises. They are writing what are cringe-worthy fluff pieces to, of course, please their far-left editors. But while they lie to your face, again, we will bring you the truth. We will, as usual, do the job, the state run propaganda hate-Trump media mob called refers us to do. Buckle up, because tonight, we are vetting Kamala Harris and it continues. In just moments, we will call out her phony praise of Joe Biden. Wow. Amazing what a day can do and it can change everything. We'll also show you her very and most radical socialist positions from police, to fracking, the consumption of red meat and even the elimination of straws and all private health care plans, they would be outlawed and her support of gun bans by executive fiat. Also, Vice President Mike Pence will weigh in, straight ahead. But we'll start in Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden somehow managed to travel a few miles away from his basement bunker to introduce his new running mate after, what, a three-hour delay and extremely long, meandering speech, delivered with the help of his trusty teleprompter in an almost empty gymnasium, Joe Biden finally made it official. And during the joint event, didn't take questions after trashing President Trump, predictively. Of course, both Biden and Harris heaped scripted praise all over each other. It was so fake, so blatantly phony that you couldn't help but kind of cringe when you know the truth. There was only a few months ago that Kamala Harris was heavily suggesting that Joe Biden was a racist and a sexist. Oh, amazing how things change in election years, isn't that? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: You also worked with them to oppose busing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. His empathy, his compassion, his sense of duty to care for others. It's why I am so proud to be on this ticket. JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's mischaracterization of my opposition across the board. I did not praise racists. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She is ready to do this job on day one. HARRIS: Praising and coddling individuals who made it their life's work and built their reputation off of segregation of the races in the United States. That's the problem. His empathy, his compassion, his sense of duty to care for others is why I am so proud to be on this ticket. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Well, Kamala Harris back then was right, because Joe Biden praised the guy that actually filibuster the Civil Rights Act and opposed the Voting Rights Act. That historic -- both historic legislation, and worked with the former Klansman on the issue of stopping the integration of schools and saying he didn't want his kids going to school in a, quote, racial jungle. So why would Joe Biden pick a running mate who all but pretty much called him racist over and over again? Why would he pick someone who said \"I believe Biden's sexual misconduct accusers\"? Well, the answer is simple. Senator Harris is a favorite of the radical far left establishment. New York toilet paper Times, though, they called her a pragmatic moderate. No way, shape, or form. That's just another outright lie by The New York Times. 2019, she had the most liberal voting record of any other U.S. senator. She was actually to the left of Bolshevik Bernie Sanders. She was the cosponsor of that insane Green New Deal and maybe they are just trying to cover up his crazy socialist agenda by giving Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez a whopping 60 seconds, we found out tonight, to speak at the Democratic Convention. Unfortunately, for Kamala Harris, she is now on tape promising to ban all fracking. Pennsylvania, are you paying attention? On day one in office, take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Will you commit to implement in a federal ban on fracking your first day in office? Adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice. HARRIS: There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. So, yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. That one radical move that would cost a half a million high-paying jobs in Pennsylvania. Yeah, 100,000 plus jobs in Ohio, millions of other jobs across the country. It would send the price of oil and gas, the lifeblood of our economy, through the roof. And there's a lot more. As part of her radical socialist agenda, Harris would even ban plastic straws and limit your consumption of red meat. I just love when the government is there to tell me how to live. And if you like your doctor, if you like your health insurance plan, well, you're going to want to listen very closely to this next insane radical socialist clip. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: I believe the solution and I actually feel very strongly about this, we need to have Medicare for all. That's just the bottom line. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? HARRIS: Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. Who of us that does not have that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this. Let's eliminate all of that, let's move on. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Eliminate it, move on. Wow. Then you're stuck with Obamacare. How did those promises workout? Now, if Harris gets her way, over 200 million Americans would have their health insurance stripped away, no choice, no options. I thought liberals were pro-choice. Apparently not on this issue. And, of course, your taxes, they will go through the roof. She's already plotting major tax hikes. So, let's keep track of this minor part of her radical agenda, Senator Harris would confiscate your private health insurance, your income, yep, it even says by executive fiat we are going to take away some of your guns, your plastic straws, your red meat and that list goes on. She wants the government to complete would dictate every aspect of your life. That's because like many of the radical socialist left, well, Senator Harris believes that the American people actually says it about one particular voting bloc and demographic are just stupid. Well, you don't believe me, let's go to the videotape. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: What else do we know about this population 18 to 24? They are stupid. That is why we put them in dormitories and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions. HANNITY: Well, we just lock them all up until they are 25? Now, if you watch the other so-called news networks or read almost any paper in the country, you will never get the truth about Senator Harris. You will never see these clips, you will never hear about her radical positions and her radical record. They will lie to you day in and day out for the next 83 days and they will continue to push the line that she has a pragmatic moderate. At this point, the mob, the media has absolutely zero self-respect and they don't concern themselves with anything that recognizes truth. They are now hard-core, statist, partisan Democrats that will say and do anything to beat Donald Trump. It's a cult of hatred, a psychosis, kind of hard to explain actually. Let's take a look at their vetting of Kamala Harris. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just being told we have a pick and its Kamala Harris of California. Just told in my ear at the second. For the record, those of applause were from Claire McCaskill. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that Kamala Harris adds a layer of energy to the Biden campaign. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People wanted to be around her. There was a charisma, fascination, for lack of a better word, Anderson, a bit of celebrity surrounding Kamala Harris. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden could have chosen someone else, but he couldn't have chosen anyone better. She is clearly a great campaigner, but she's also good at governing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats have thought since she stepped onto the stage that she had an incredibly bright future. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think if you think about Kamala Harris, she herself a fighter, right? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's an energetic campaigner. Women's vote, younger people's vote. All of this brings enormous energy. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: One, pretty much anybody would have more energy than, well, the ever forgetful Joe. It seems like he needs a nap very often and she only had 2 percent or less. The coverage was so bad, so abusively biased, one of these fake journalists and lunatic at fake news CNN complained that we were throwing everything but the kitchen sink at Kamala Harris. That's actually called vetting the candidate. Fake news CNN might want to try it out sometime on a Democratic candidate. Just the candidate's record, just the exact things which they have set in the positions they've taken with the accompanying proof, the video and audio tapes. Especially now, all of the obvious concerns about Biden's, frankly, mental alertness, acuity from fitness for office, his strength and stamina. Now, get this: the media raised those questions about 71-year-old John McCain and his age in 2008. They raised questions about 73-year-old Ronald Reagan during his reelection bid in 1984. By the way, for the record, Biden would be older on his first day of office than Reagan was on his last day of office. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT: I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Checkmate, Ronald Reagan won 49 states. Now, all of a sudden, the mob and the media, they are asked a question about 77-year-old Biden's mental acuity. I'm not a doctor, but he looks kind of fragile, tired, weak to me. These constant embarrassments, they are beginning to raise a lot of serious questions. And people in the country are talking about it, whether the mob wants to cover it up or not. The confusion, the bouts of anger. Are you a junkie? Did you get tested for cocaine? Come on, man. Almost no one outside of this network even seems willing to seriously broach the subject. We will do our job. In fact, they are actively trying to cover up his apparent issues. Over there at state-run conspiracy television MSDNC -- well, they seemingly actually cropped out what appeared to be a written script of Biden and having a casual video conversation with Kamala Harris. And by the way, you can actually see Biden in that picture, he's holding the phone upside down. And ultimately the Biden campaign is hoping that Kamala Harris will bring a much-needed boost of energy, charisma, alertness, that Biden clearly lacks. That was those are fundamentals I think for the hardest job in the world and is one problem with that theory. Kamala -- well, she doesn't connect with voters. Her presidential bid was a massive failure, a flop. She dropped out in December before any primary or any caucus. She was pulling at a meager 2 percent or less, especially after Tulsi Gabbard's takedown. Even in her home state of California, she was pulling in single digits. They know her best. But fear not, the media mob, the cult that they are, that hates Trump 24/7, all they will do and say anything they can to help lift her up. Just take a look at today's front page, New York toilet paper \"Times\", it's worthless. Basically, it's as good as toilet paper. Compare it to their coverage in 2016 of Vice President Pence. Donald Trump's choice for a running mate. As we have said many times on the show, back in 2007 forward, journalism is dead, it is gone, it is buried. Here with reaction, the man himself, Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thank you for being with us. MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: Good to be with you, Sean. HANNITY: OK. \u00a0Well, I can imagine that you got a little bit different treatment than Kamala Harris. \u00a0(LAUGHTER) \u00a0But let's stick to substance and the issues here. I think that's important. \u00a0I argue this will be the biggest-choice election, tipping-point election even, in history. Your initial reaction? PENCE: Well, the stakes in this election have never been higher. \u00a0But following Joe Biden's decision to name a California liberal like Kamala Harris to the ticket, the choice has never been clearer. \u00a0Look, four years ago, when President Trump called and asked me to join this ticket, I said yes in a heartbeat because I believed in his vision, to rebuild our military, to revive our economy by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, fighting for free, fair trade, unleashing American energy, standing up for life and liberty, and appointing conservatives to our courts, and standing with law enforcement at every level. \u00a0And Joe Biden's decision to add Kamala Harris to the ticket confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying. And that is that Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left. \u00a0Kamala Harris, like Joe Biden, supports higher taxes, socialized medicine, open borders, abortion on demand. And where Joe Biden said he would be willing to cut funding to police, she said recently that she thought that we should reimagine the police in this country. \u00a0And I just have to tell you, I -- you know, I like the matchup. You know, it's on, Sean. I can't wait to get back out there. I will be in Iowa tomorrow, telling the story of what this president has done, how we made this country stronger, more prosperous in our first three years, how President Trump has seen us through the worst pandemic in 100 years, and how we have already created more jobs in the last three months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama created in their eight years in office. \u00a0I'm excited to tell the story. I think Kamala Harris being added to the ticket just confirms what President Trump and I have been saying all along. HANNITY: You know, Mr. Vice President, four years ago, I -- look, I'm now 33 years in radio, if you can believe it. I know I look so much younger, my 25th year at FOX. (LAUGHTER) And, you know, I said to this audience -- and I have to always be honest -- I said Donald Trump, I have known him for about 25 years now. I said, he will govern as a conservative. \u00a0Every issue you just mentioned is -- it is transformational, in as much as he kept every promise, every single one of them. PENCE: He did. HANNITY: There's not one thing he said that he wanted to get done that really has not gotten done. PENCE: Right. HANNITY: And I look at it, and then I look at the results. And results matter to me. \u00a0I can't think of a single accomplishment of Joe Biden in 50 years of the swamp that helped benefit the American people. Can you? \u00a0And I know Kamala Harris is going to be out there attacking the president daily. If I was him, I would ignore every word she says and focus on what he's done and what he plans to do. PENCE: Well, I think it's the reason why you see the support all across the country that you see for this president and for our administration. \u00a0And that's that President Trump has done exactly what he told the American people he would do. We rebuilt our military, restored the arsenal of democracy. And now, America's military is stronger than ever before. \u00a0But this president, by cutting taxes, by rolling back more regulations than any president in American history, by fighting for the kind of free and fair trade like the USMCA that was a win for American manufacturing, a win for American farmers, a trade deal that Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against, and you see his commitment to follow through on appointing conservatives to our courts at every level. \u00a0Contrast that with now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They actually want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They want to do their own version of the Green New Deal, of a $2 trillion massive environmental agenda. They are going to appoint activists to our court. They're going to support taxpayer funding of abortion. \u00a0They support open borders. And the truth of the matter is, beyond all of that, with everything that's happening in Chicago and New York and Portland and Seattle, you have in President Trump a leader who is standing without apology with the men and women of law enforcement. \u00a0And in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party and the radical left, you have people talking about cutting funding to law enforcement, a party that's advocating defunding law enforcement. The choice could not be clearer. \u00a0And, as I said, I can't wait to get out there, and get out there and tell that story. And I think the American people are going to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. HANNITY: Mr. Vice President, I think I'm a pretty good political observer. \u00a0And if you noticed the debate, when Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden on his racial positions, which are -- you know, imagine if Donald Trump supported the guy that filibustered the Civil Rights Act and talked about not wanting his kids to be involved in integration or -- quote -- \"a racial jungle,\" I could imagine the media would have a very different reaction to Joe Biden. \u00a0And, as I look at this scene -- it's actually on the screen right now -- she, to me -- and you will be debating her -- it looked to me that that line was prepared, that line was memorized, and that line was delivered, somewhat perfectly, pretty devastating to Joe Biden, although she feels very differently now, apparently. \u00a0Did you get the same feeling I did, that that was all prepared ahead of time? PENCE: Well, look, I think -- you know, I think she is a skilled debater. \u00a0But I can't wait to get to Salt Lake City and be on the stage with her to compare Joe Biden's nearly 50 years in public life, the agenda of the radical left, the agenda that she has embraced throughout her political career, with the results of this president and this administration. \u00a0I mean, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris come from a party that's been talking about helping African-Americans for decades. This is a president who, because of the policies we advanced, we actually saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans. \u00a0We saw the creation of thousands of Opportunity Zones and creating billions of dollars of investment in our inner cities. This is a president who doubled the school choice program here in our nation's capital, has been fighting for educational opportunities for every American, especially our minority communities. \u00a0And that's a record that I'm excited to talk about. This is a president who's been out there fighting for the American dream for every American, regardless of race or creed or color. HANNITY: I -- PENCE: And while the other side does the talking, we are going to talk about what we have done for the American people and what we are going to do with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. HANNITY: I would like to -- you know, I would like to not have one vote cast until at least one debate between the president and Joe Biden. \u00a0Joe Biden says he can't wait, says he wants to do it. PENCE: Right. HANNITY: The president has offered to have one. Sixteen states will be voting before -- early voting before the first debate. \u00a0I think that has to change. Do you agree? PENCE: Oh, there's no question. And I know the campaign is reaching out, look, particularly in the times in which we live, as we continue every day to work to put the coronavirus in the past, we are seeing positive trends across the Sunbelt. We are seeing leveling trends in other states around the country. We're every day one day closer to having more medicines and more vaccines. \u00a0To your point, Sean, we're going to be -- we're going to be seeing states around the country start early voting in a matter of a month or so. And I think the American people ought to hear from this president and hear from Joe Biden on the stage to talk about their competing visions for this country -- HANNITY: Yes. PENCE: -- because they could not be more different. \u00a0I mean, I truly do believe that President Trump's vision in our first three years was proven out. I mean, we made America more prosperous than ever before. This president and his policies, with our allies in Congress, created the conditions, the most -- the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. \u00a0And when the coronavirus pandemic struck, it's that solid foundation that President Trump poured that's allowed us to add nine million jobs back as we open up this economy just in the last three months alone. HANNITY: Yes. PENCE: And, again, Joe Biden -- I mean, when people go into the voting booth on November 3, or when they participate in early voting before then, they deserve to know that here, as we -- as our country is coming back from this -- this massive pandemic that, at its height, cost 22 million American jobs, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, their prescription -- HANNITY: Yes. PENCE: -- is to raise taxes by $4 trillion and impose an avalanche of regulations, like the Green New Deal, on the American economy. HANNITY: Scary. PENCE: And, you know -- but it's no real surprise. \u00a0It's what -- it's what Joe Biden and Barack Obama did in their eight years. They tried to tax and spend and regulate us into prosperity. And they oversaw the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. \u00a0I want to say it again, Sean. HANNITY: Yes. PENCE: It's remarkable that, because of the foundation President Trump poured, we have actually seen this economy create more jobs in the last three months than Joe Biden and the last administration created in their entire eight years. HANNITY: Yes. PENCE: The American people deserve to understand those two competing visions. \u00a0And, when they do, I believe they are going to vote to reelect President Donald Trump. HANNITY: Mr. Vice President, we always thank you for your time. Thank you for being with us. PENCE: Thank you, Sean. HANNITY: Joining us now, Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer. I think the vice president laid it out clearly. Did you see what I saw in that attack and that debate when Kamala Harris -- what did Joe Biden on the issue on the race, I saw lines that were prepared, lines that were memorized and lines that were delivered. Thoughts? ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Of course she did. That's exactly what she did and you saw her fake it all. You know, when I look at this ticket, my conclusion is Biden is weak and Harris is fake. You know, her position on busing is identical to Joe Biden's. And yet she gives that impassioned, heartfelt story about what happened to a little child and then it comes out the next day that she also supported what Biden did, which is no national busing program, but it should be determined locally. That was Biden's position in the \u201870s. It's Harris' position, yet she attacked him for having her position? That's the definition of fakery in a politician. And she's delivered it her entire career. HANNITY: It's amazing the election you're converging considering what she was saying about Joe just a short time ago. You know, Karl Rove said this last night, O'Reilly said it on my radio show and I agree, I think that Kamala Harris is going to be attacking the president, that is going to be her full-time vocation. She only had 2 percent in the Democratic primary. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but my strategy would be to completely ignore the attacks and point out the truth on the record that the media will never talk about. FLEISCHER: Look, race has always come down to presidential candidates and there's typically a minor blip when someone gets named, but voters vote for the president. That's going to be especially the case on the Republican side with Donald Trump. With all due respect to Vice President Pence and I think the vice president knows that. But also, it's a little different on the Democrat side because of Biden's frailty. People do worry and wonder who are they voting for, are they voting for Biden or they voting for Harris? And in the case of Harris, because of this fakery, another, Sean, as California's attorney general, acted tough, tough prosecutor. What does she say now? She compared ICE agents to the KKK at a Senate hearing this year. She asked, was asked a question about somebody in a crowd who talked about police are there to protect the rich and harass the poor, she nodded her head, and said, right, right. That's the problem with her. She's a fake and her positions are going to hurt her in the vice president is going to drive that home. HANNITY: All right. Ari Fleischer, always great to have you. Great analysis as always. When we come back, we continue to do what the mob, the media, the cult that hates Trump won't do, and that is we will vet the Biden-Harris ticket. Up next, we'll expose Kamala Harris and her radical antipolice views that Ari just mentioned, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Believe it or not, Kamala Harris tonight is even facing ire from the progressive left over her, well, ever evolving, phony, constantly changing views on policing and prosecutions. Don't forget, it was Kamala Harris troubling record as a prosecutor in California that became a serious liability during her failed presidential run. Remember, we showed you Tulsi Gabbard ripping her record in a debate last night and as attorney general -- district attorney, rather, in San Francisco and is California attorney general, Harris' office was plagued by incompetence and efficiency, even claims of last night and as attorney general -- district attorney, rather, in San Francisco and is California attorney general, her office was plagued by incompetence and efficiency, even claims of outright corruption. Sidney Powell pointed that out back in 2015. Harris was scorched by a federal judge after, quote, Harris and her staff defended the indefensible after it was revealed that a state prosecutor falsified a transcript of a confession. So ever since, Harris has, well, set foot on Capitol Hill, she's been working overtime to pander to the far left and pretend like none of that ever happen. Remember the Michael Brown case, Ferguson, Missouri? Just last year, quote, tweeted: Michael Brown's murder forever changed Ferguson and America. His tragic death sparked a desperately need conversation and a nationwide movement. We must fight for stronger accountability of racial equality in our justice system. And, by the way, even the Justice Department of Obama said he was innocent. Remember, she promoted the Jessie Smollett hate crime hoax, saying: This was an attempted modern day lynching. Wrong again. Now more recently, Harris actually appeared to endorse the idea of less cops on the street. This wouldn't end well, take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: We have confused the idea that to achieve safety you put more cops on the street. We really do need to understand and re-imagine what and how we can actually make and help make communities safe. You know, in many cities in America, over one-third of their city budget goes to police. So, we have to have this conversation. What are we doing? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: She filed those remarks, praise for the L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, his plan to slash the LAPD budget, saying, I applaud Mayor Garcetti for what is doing and done. But even more disturbing, that Harris recently promoted the Minnesota freedom fund, which posted bail for alleged violent rioters and criminals, including an alleged murder and previously convicted rapist. So you see what's going on here? Just like Hillary Clinton, just like the rest of the unhinged Democratic socialist cabal, well, Kamala Harris is willing to say and do anything to pander to the extreme left in this country who already rejected her once during the Democratic primary. Yeah, she was below 2 percent. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox News contributor, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell. Leo, OK. You were warning, you know her well, you live in California. This is pretty atrocious comments about law enforcement and positions. LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Just give me a minute on this. Joe Biden needs a do over. You know why, you're talking about that script that she did about I'm the little girl. She gives lawyers a bad name. She will say and do anything to win that is why you cannot believe anything out of her mouth. You saw different Kamala Harris today at the press conference and this was the Kamala Harris who wanted to destroy Joe Biden. Let me be very clear about her. She will say things about Black Lives Matter. She said that today. Well, Kamala, is it Black Lives Matter like David Dorn, the black officer, is a black lives like the ones in Chicago? When you say black lives matter, is that all black lives or are you just saying that to appease the extremist group? That's a situation that she has explained. The other thing about it is, if she is such a pro-law and order moderate Democrat, where's all the police unions supporting her? They are supporting Donald Trump. One last thing, she's a nasty person. She's mean. Look what you try to do with Justice Kavanaugh. And when you talk about what she's planned to do, if I was Joe Biden, I would sleep with one eye open, because she is looking to take over the White House. She's only in it for herself, period. HANNITY: Wow. Dan Bongino, Secret Service, former NYPD. I hate the way police have been treated, the 99 percent of brave cops that put their lives at risk to protect and serve others. DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah. Well, you know, Sean, nobody likes Kamala Harris, can we just be clear on that? I mean, she competed in a Democrat primary and didn't even make it to Iowa. It's not a Republican. I had nothing to do with it, I'm a registered Republican. So the Democrats apparently don't like her either. I'm just giving you the numbers. If you believe in science stuff, liberals claim they believe in science and everything. Let's not forget as well, the two most memorable moments of Kamala Harris' campaign was when she implied that Joe Biden was a racist, number one. That was her star is born moment in the second one is that she believed Joe Biden's accusers, that he was all gropey, you know, and hansy and stuff, you know, things -- putting hands on people he probably shouldn't have been doing. Kamala Harris is -- she's the Beto O'Rourke and John Kerry, you know? Two candidates who would change -- remember John Kerry? I was before it before I was against it. You know, and Beto who would lick his finger and change his position based on the political winds -- well, Kamala Harris is even worse. You know, I use this analogy once talking about Beto, but I think it applies better to Kamala Harris. She's like -- a member Ghostbusters? You know, Gozer the Gozerian, you know, Gozer is whatever you think he is. You know, If you think of the stay puffed marshmallow man, that's what he -- that's Kamala Harris. She'll be whatever she wants. She's been on the opposite side, Sean, of every position. She was for the cops and against the cops. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Yeah. BONGINO: Yeah, she has to defend -- \u00a0you know what, you should do that on your radio show. When I guess hosted for you once, I did that with Obama. Ask Linda. I'm not kidding. I did it on Obama versus Obama debate. Do a Kamala versus Kamala debate. It will be a huge hit on your radio show. HANNITY: I'm going to on that and I will even take credit. Real quick, exit question. OK. Should the president ever mention her name or talk about her? Because she is the VP. It's Biden he's running against. Thoughts, real quick, Leo. TERRELL: Let me answer. Yes, because she is disingenuous and she needs to be exposed. She is basically a Biden surrogate. He needs to attack her. HANNITY: I disagree. Dan Bongino? You know, let her go out there and flail in the wind as far as I'm concerned and, you know, nobody cares. BONGINO: Yeah -- Sean, I hate -- I'm with Leo on this one. (LAUGHTER) BONGINO: Who would've thought the day I would be on your show agreeing with Leo and disagreeing with Sean Hannity? TERRELL: Yeah! (CROSSTALK) BONGINO: What is going on here? TERRELL: Sean -- I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I know how she plays. I know the game. HANNITY: You want to drive the media crazy and the Democrats crazy? Ignore them -- Biden is the candidate. VPs don't win elections. All right, love you both anyway. I still think I'm right. When we come back, the undercover antiabortion journalist who is suing Kamala Harris, well, he claims that she pursued a politically-driven investigation against him. We've got videotape you won't see anywhere else, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: A combination of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris authoritarian instincts, hers is California's A.G., well, determined defense of Planned Parenthood, well, that led to trouble in the past for her as her 2016 Senate campaign accepted donations from an boasted strong support for Planned Parenthood, even asking supporters to sign a petition to defend the organization. Kamala's, well, California's top prosecutor at the time ordered a raid on the residence of David Daleiden, remember him, who produced the undercover videos to expose highly controversial activities within Planned Parenthood. And then again in 2016, Kamala Harris accepted campaign donations from the very same Planned Parenthood and also ordered a raid on a journalist investigating Planned Parenthood. That's pretty corrupt. Daleiden is now suing Kamala Harris, alleging that she conspired to violate his civil rights. Here with more is, well, pro-life activist David Daleiden and Trump 2020 director of press communications, Erin Perrine is back with us. Thank you both for being with us. I understand you gave our team some video too regarding this? DAVID DALEIDEN, THE CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS FOUNDER: Definitely. Kamala Harris in my experience, I've been on the receiving end of her abuse of power and her pattern of targeting Americans who have viewpoints that disagree with her own, targeting them and using her powers of office to try and punish them for viewpoints that disagree with hers. HANNITY: Yeah. Well, I mean, they raided your home, then you see the money flow back to her and her campaign. And I'm thinking, well, that's a very, very convenient relationship they have going on there. DALEIDEN: It's outrageous. When Kamala Harris was the attorney general of the state of California, if you were an animal rights activist, you could do undercover video to expose how animals were being treated and Kamala Harris praised those activists and used that video for her agenda as attorney general. But if you are an undercover journalist investigating Planned Parenthood, investigating the abortion industry, trafficking baby body parts, then, Kamala Harris wanted to silence you, wanted to intimidate you and wanted to make sure that your message was punished and didn't get out there to the public. HANNITY: I wish you a lot of luck in this lawsuit, I really do. Erin, you know, one of the things -- we talk about taxpayer dollars to fund Planned Parenthood. OK, we know the racist, eugenic views of Margaret Sanger rarely gets talk about. Why is that? ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: Well, this is just another cover by the media. But it's clear that Kamala Harris has a distinct record of putting politics before justice. You see that in this Planned Parenthood case. You've seen it when she decided to not pursue the death penalty against an MS-13 gang member who murdered a father and his son, or a cop killer. She supports sanctuary cities. She is an extreme California liberal who is more concerned about being a puppet for Planned Parenthood and the extreme left in the United States than she is actually about pursuing justice or the law or the Constitution in the United States. It's absolutely disgusting and it really shows you what Joe Biden thinks where the Democrat Party is going at this point. HANNITY: By the way, I said Erin Perrine, I got your name wrong -- I apologize, as always. You know, it does -- and this is -- lawsuit -- there's never been, David, a more pro-life president. Everyone has gone to speak at the annual Right to Life march ever. Never been a candidate more pro-religious freedom -- I'm sorry, president, not a candidate -- there's never been a president that's been more friendly to our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. Donald Trump is all of them. DALEIDEN: I hope that all Americans, Sean, are going to be able to come together to oppose the kind of radical disrespect and contempt for the First Amendment and for first amendment civil liberties that Kamala Harris has demonstrated throughout her career. HANNITY: Yes. And, you know, Erin, so much is at stake here and when you look at -- we really could have Kamala debating Kamala, right? Let's be honest here. And what she said about Joe Biden then, and what she's saying about him now, pretty amazing election-year conversion. PERRINE: Well, anything to get herself on the ticket, right? She certainly is willing to change her views. I mean, does she believe that Joe Biden supported segregationist policies or does she not? Was that just a convenient narrative to try and score political points on the stage against her political adversaries? You're going to see her flip and flop. Does she still support the Green New Deal? Does she still support Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-All when she rushed to the Senate floor to sign on to that bill first? HANNITY: Of course, she does. PERRINE: Well, what is it for Kamala, because she certainly wants to waffle and waver as she tries to raise taxes on Americans, but let's be clear, she is a California liberal. The Biden-Harris ticket is dangerous for America. HANNITY: All right. Erin, thank you. And, David, thank you for being with us. Good luck with your lawsuit. When we come back, we do have a surprise, big announcement at the end of the show. Up next, Susan Rice wasn't picked to be Joe Biden's running mate, but today, she hinted at a -- well, big position in a possible Biden administration. I can't wait for those next Sunday shows of lies. Anyway, Ric Grenell, Gregg Jarrett, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: There were some -- many people actually that thought Susan Rice would be crushed (ph) -- not selected as Biden's VP candidate. Today, well, Rice strongly hinted, well, she may be given a role in any potential Biden administration and she'd welcome it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSAN RICE, FORMER OBAMA NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I'm glad that I'm going to be able to support them and do my utmost to help elect Biden- Harris and help them govern when the time comes. I'll do everything I possibly can to help Joe Biden become the next president of the United States and to help them succeed in governing in whatever form or fashion he wants. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Here with reaction, former acting DNI director, Ric Grenell, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Ric, let me go to you. Remember, she went on a five Sunday shows and she said this violence was sparked in Benghazi by a very offensive video that began spontaneously? Well, she lied on five Sunday shows. I've interviewed the Benghazi guys and I never heard of a spontaneous demonstration. We just happen to have RPGs in your back pocket. Oh, let me spontaneously pulled this out and fire at the embassy. RIC GRENELL, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yeah. Look, she -- Susan Rice was passed over for secretary of state by the Obama-Biden team. She's got more baggage than LAX. Here's the fact of the matter is -- she has been in the front row seat for two genocides, one in Rwanda when she was the assistant secretary of state for Africa, and two, in Syria when she was the national security advisor. So while she was there with a front row seat, she never got up out of her chair, Sean. HANNITY: I never heard of the spontaneous demonstration, as I mentioned, Gregg Jarrett, just happen to have an RPG in your back pocket. It was Donald J. Trump that beat the caliphate in Syria because he took off the handcuffs that the Obama administration put on our military if I recall correctly. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, you're right. Look, Susan Rice's deceptions, lies, abuse of power and malfeasance are legendary in Washington, D.C. She had to withdraw her name from consideration a secretary of state to succeed Hillary Clinton in 2012 because of the five lies on five Sunday talk shows. But it's worse than that, Sean. It appears she lied to Congress. She said she knew nothing about the FBI collusion investigation or the sub investigation of Michael Flynn. In fact, she knew all about it and was involved in it. She attended the White House meeting in which it was discussed with Comey and Obama. And, of course, there are documents that show she knew about the investigation shortly after it was launched in the summer of 2016. She lied about unmasking, claiming she knew nothing about it. When confronted with evidence, she admitted it was a lie because she was complicit in the unmasking. But worse than that, she was reading and analyzing secret intelligence summaries of Trump officials. That was political espionage, because the summaries had nothing to do with national security and everything to do with politics. But I'll make this prediction. If Biden wins in November and the Senate flips, she'll be nominated and confirmed as secretary of state. HANNITY: Wow. JARRETT: It should be frightening to many Americans. HANNITY: Last word, Ric Grenell. GRENELL: Yeah, look, I think that she was passed over because the Obama- Biden team and now the Biden-Harris team are going to see that she just is problematic from the get-go. I think that she's going to need to have if they win, and I don't think that they will, I think that she's going to have to have an appointment because she can't get through the Senate. She's been lying and spying for too long. And don't forget that when you read her under oath transcripts when she was under oath with penalty of perjury, she says, I didn't see any Russian collusion, and that's quite a different story when she was on TV spouting that she knew and saw a whole bunch more. HANNITY: And thanks to you we know a lot more than we did and they all said they never saw any collusion. There's nobody that said they did see it. Thank you both. A big announcement when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: I want us to end tonight's program with a thank you and a great appreciation. My new book, \"Live Free or Die\" America and the world on the brink will debut number one on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list. I can't thank you enough. It's not about being number one, it's about keeping America number one. This is the most radical, extreme agenda. It'll destroy -- if these policies are implemented, it'll destroy liberty and freedom, and these promises will never be fulfilled. I'm hosting a live virtual event 7:00 Eastern tomorrow. Information, just go to Hannity.com and 40 percent off today on the book. Let not your heart be troubled. Governor Huckabee in for Laura tonight. Governor, how are you? It's great to see you.

            "article_content": "Fox News senior political analyst weighs on suspicions over Amy Coney Barrett's faith This is a rush transcript from \u201cThe Story with Martha MacCallum\" September 22, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening,\u00a0everybody. I am Martha MacCallum in New York and this is THE STORY.President Trump is about to hold a rally into in Moon Township,\u00a0Pennsylvania. He has campaigned in Pennsylvania four times this year. Biden\u00a0has visited the home of 20 electoral votes ten times since becoming the\u00a0nominee. Several of those were during the DNC. We are watching and we're\u00a0going to take you there shortly.Meanwhile though back on Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court prepares to\u00a0remember Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She will lie in repose there tomorrow\u00a0and Thursday, and then on Friday she will become the first woman in history\u00a0to lie in state in the United States state capital.As the battle over for her replacement rages on tonight with President\u00a0Trump announcing that he reveal his nominee on Saturday evening. We expect\u00a0that around 5:00 pm. listen to this statement though that was written by 11\u00a0U.S. Senators.\"Not since 1932 has the Senate confirmed in a presidential election year a\u00a0Supreme Court nominee to a vacancy arising that year. And it is necessary\u00a0to go back even further to 1888 in order to find an election-year nominee\u00a0who was nominated and confirmed under divided government as we have now\".Now that letter was not written by today's Senate Democrats but these\u00a0Republican Senators back in 2016 when President Obama nominated Judge\u00a0Merrick Garland. The key phrase in that letter is this one \"Under divided\u00a0government\" in that case meaning a Democrat who was in the White House,\u00a0President Obama, and the Republican Senate at that time.Senator Mike Lee is one of the Senators who signed that letter and we will\u00a0hear from him on his thoughts on the current state and just a moment. Brit\u00a0Hume is going to join us as well to tackle how the messaging from some in\u00a0both parties shifted on this issue. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The job first and foremost is for the president\u00a0to nominate and for the Senate to hold hearings.American people don't want Republicans to move forward with the\u00a0confirmation. They know this is wrong.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): It is the Senate's constitutional right to act\u00a0as a check on the president and withhold its consent. Moving ahead with a\u00a0vote on the forthcoming Supreme Court nomination will be consistent with\u00a0both history and precedent.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So we begin tonight with Utah Senator Mike Lee who sits on the\u00a0Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator, good to have you with us tonight\u00a0obviously there's a lot of barbs flying back and forth and a lot of tape\u00a0that gets replayed on both sides on this issue. But this was live earlier\u00a0today. This is Senator Chuck Schumer. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCHUMER: They are proving right now that their speeches mean nothing the\u00a0moment that she was on the other foot. Senate Republicans should heed\u00a0leader McConnell's own words from 2013. He said \"You will regret this and\u00a0you may regret this a lot sooner than you think.\"\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: I would add, here just the Reuters poll, 62 percent say wait for\u00a0the next president. The poll found 62 percent of American adults agreed\u00a0that the vacancy should be filled by the winner on November 3rd. 23 percent\u00a0disagreed and the rest were not sure. So your thoughts on all of that\u00a0Senator. Welcome.SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): Thank you, Martha. My first thought is as to the\u00a0poll, the one poll that matters is among U.S. Senators. You're going to\u00a0have a majority of U.S. Senators who believes that we need to fill this\u00a0vacancy. Look we've had 29 Supreme Court vacancies arise during\u00a0Presidential Election years in the history of our republic.On ten of those occasions we had divided government. The president in\u00a0charge of one party in the Senate under another, nine out of those ten\u00a0cases, the candidate the nominee was rejected. 19 times of those 29, there\u00a0was no divided government. 18 out of 19 of those times the vacancy was\u00a0filled.We're following precedent that has been set and adhered to in most cases\u00a0where vacancy arises in a Presidential Election year. We chose not to\u00a0confirm Merrick Garland as was our prerogative it was a divided government.We had a Democratic President and Republican Senate. It was surprising to\u00a0no one that we do it that way and Democrats would have done exactly the\u00a0same way have a shoe been on the other foot.MACCALLUM: So not to go back too much but is there any wish that at that\u00a0point would have at least gone to the hearing stage so that you Senate\u00a0Republicans could now say we put into the process of the vote failed.LEE: No, not at all Martha. In fact, quite to the contrary what I said in\u00a02016 was that it would be pointless. It would be a waste of everyone's time\u00a0including Merrick Garland, to put him through a hearing when we knew that\u00a0we weren't going to confirm him.We gave our advice and consent. We performed our advice and consent\u00a0function by rejecting Merrick Garland. We just chose to not run him through\u00a0hearing process when we knew the outcome at the outset.The person isn't confirmed unless the Senate votes to confirm. We chose not\u00a0to do that. There's nothing in the constitution that requires us to hold\u00a0that vote or even to hold that hearing. It would've been cruel to do so\u00a0knowing that we were going to reject him.MACCALLUM: That raises an interesting point in the present. Is there an\u00a0intention to hold a hearing? Will we see hearings in this nomination?LEE: Yes. We will see hearings. They will happen within the next few weeks,\u00a0I hope, I expect. I will argue vehemently for completing those hearings and\u00a0completing developer for Election Day. I think it's imperative that we do\u00a0so and I think that's what will happen.MACCALLUM: So obviously there are a few names at the top the list. Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett is among them. Barbara Lagoa of the 11th District Court in\u00a0Atlanta also Judge Rushing is on that list, Judge Larson, whose name we've\u00a0also seen in the mix. Who would you like to see the president pick?LEE: I expect that we are going to see Amy Coney Barrett being picked by\u00a0the president. I would support that nomination wholeheartedly. She's got a\u00a0proven track record. She is someone who understands the difference between\u00a0judging and lawmaking.She understands that she is there to interpret the law based on what the\u00a0word say rather than on the basis of what some social scientist or lawyer\u00a0might wish it said. That's exactly the kind of person we need on the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court and I think it will and should be her.\u00a0MACCALLUM: We are told the president will meet with Barbara Lagoa in\u00a0Florida on Friday. We heard from him just a short time ago that he will\u00a0announce his decision on Saturday. We expect that to happen around 5:00.\u00a0Why would you say that Judge Barrett is a better choice than Judge Lagoa?LEE: Judge Barrett is someone who throughout her entire lifetime has\u00a0devoted herself to conservative principles, including and especially the\u00a0principles of textualism and originalism. She served as a law clerk to\u00a0Justice Scalia.It is in the mold of Justice Scalia and Justice Alito and Justice Thomas\u00a0that we want President Trump to be naming replacements to vacancies that\u00a0occur within the Supreme Court. Amy Coney Barrett is exactly that kind of\u00a0nominee and that's why I hope and expect that it will be her.\u00a0MACCALLUM: All right. Mike Lee, Senator, thank you very much. Good to have\u00a0you with us tonight.LEE: Thank you Martha.MACCALLUM: Also joining me now, Fox News Senior Political Analyst Brit\u00a0Hume. Brit, great to have you with us tonight.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you, Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So I actually want to stay on the subject of Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0here for a minute and to replay a moment with Senator Dianne Feinstein, who\u00a0is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and who had an\u00a0opportunity to question her in the past. On the subject of her faith, here\u00a0is what Senator Feinstein had to say at that point.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): In your case, professor, when you read your\u00a0speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within\u00a0you. That is of concern.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Talk to me about that moment Brit and some of what we are\u00a0already seeing bubble up that may become front and center again if Judge\u00a0Barrett is chosen.HUME: I fear we haven't heard the last of such comments and viewpoints.\u00a0With that to me meant when in the time it was pretty clear was that, Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett is a Catholic and she is serious about it. She's devoted to\u00a0her faith.To Dianne Feinstein, that's dogma living loud within a nominee. I think the\u00a0most ordinary people, being Christian and serious about it is not only\u00a0permissible but in many cases a highly desirable quality in anybody. We are\u00a0in for a battle here, Martha.It could be worse than anything we've seen so far. I hope not but I fear it\u00a0may be so and this is a very kind of claim that she has some sort of\u00a0religious extremist that I'm afraid we are going to hear.MACCALLUM: You think back, whether other people of different religions have\u00a0been sort of questioned in the same manner about having a faith which Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett certainly has and she made it quite clear in her response to\u00a0Senator Feinstein that it would not come into play with regard to her\u00a0interpretation of the constitution and cases that might come before her.And I expect we're going to hear a lot of that back and back-and-forth.\u00a0With regard to the prior statements that have been made and here's one of\u00a0them back in 2016 by Senator Lindsey Graham. Let's listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I want you to use my words against me. If there\u00a0is a Republican President in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of\u00a0the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let's let the next\u00a0president, whoever it might be, make that nomination. You can use my words\u00a0against me and you'd be absolutely right.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: There are similar comments from Joni Ernst but your response to\u00a0what was said then and sort of the twisting that's happening right now to\u00a0kind of overcome those statements.HUME: Oh yes. Martha, there's an epidemic of shoe on the other foot disease\u00a0here. Republicans have staked out a position that this shouldn't happen in\u00a0an election year. They never reversed themselves. Democrats who are good\u00a0otherwise now have reversed themselves.So there is plenty of that to go around. The reason for that is this; it's\u00a0not that politicians like to change their position so much. It is that\u00a0Supreme Court nominations have become such prized developments such\u00a0important developments. The aftermath of Roe versus Wade in particular\u00a0which I think is driving most of the intensity we are seeing here and in\u00a0previous nominations.No one wants to do anything but keep the judges they don't want off the\u00a0bench and get the judges they do want on the bench. The fear on the\u00a0American left and among many women is that a conservative jurist that's\u00a0distinct from a political conservative.A judicial conservative might well vote and provide a deciding vote to\u00a0reverse Roe versus Wade. That's something, that outcome is something that\u00a0is looked upon as intolerable. That's why we are seeing what we are seeing\u00a0and are about to see again.MACCALLUM: So with regard to this issue of how Democrats might retaliate,\u00a0if this is successful in getting a judge on the court before the election\u00a0or even in the lame duck session, Joe Biden, who in the past has said that\u00a0he would not consider packing the court, that he didn't think that was a\u00a0wise thing to do.He said one side puts three judges on and then in the next round the other\u00a0side puts three judges on. But here's what he said when he was asked about\u00a0the other day in Wisconsin. He wouldn't answer the question. He said it's a\u00a0legitimate question but let me tell you why I'm not going to answer that\u00a0question because it will shift the focus. What do you say about that\u00a0answer?HUME: Well, the Biden Campaign wants the election to be and the campaign to\u00a0be about Donald Trump especially his record on COVID-19. The Trump Campaign\u00a0obviously thinks there is a defensible record on COVID-19 but it thanks Joe\u00a0Biden, his positions, his condition should be the bigger issue.So there is a struggle over that. But right now there's no way around it.\u00a0Right now today the big issue is the court and the opening and the\u00a0opportunity the Republicans have to fill it and the desire of Democrats to\u00a0block it. That's where we are.I don't know that Joe Biden can duck questions on this perpetually. My\u00a0sense about his instinct is that he recognizes that the idea of court\u00a0packing starts a lot of people as liberal, the overwhelmingly popular\u00a0Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried it they back fired. It has a kind of bad\u00a0name court packing it just sounds bad.And so I think he may be want to shy away from that reason and I don't\u00a0think it's totally about the feeling that keeps the focus on Trump.\u00a0Although not answering that question doesn't really do that.MACCALLUM: Yes. And I would imagine in the coming debate cycle, we are not\u00a0privy to the questions that Chris Wallace will ask but I would imagine that\u00a0this is going to come up and that is going to be a little more difficult to\u00a0not give a decisive answer to. It's going to either open the door to that\u00a0idea or close the door to that idea for Democrats as a retaliatory move if\u00a0they lose the seat.HUME: Well, Martha I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves here\u00a0in the sense that the threats the Democrats are making are in an effort to\u00a0get the Republicans to back off. Republicans don't do that the next\u00a0question will be not what they are going to do after the election or\u00a0whether they will try to pack the court, although that could come up in\u00a0time.The next question will be in the thing we need to concern ourselves with,\u00a0what they will do to try to stop the nomination once it comes before the\u00a0Senate. We have seen the most reckless kind of unsubstantiated allegations\u00a0used in the past.The most recent example being with the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and I\u00a0think there's every chance that such a thing can happen again. It won't be\u00a0pretty. It won't be inspiring. It will be the next thing.MACCALLUM: It takes some strong spine to be at that table as a judge who\u00a0wants to become a Justice of the Supreme Court these days. We will see who\u00a0is in that seat and we're going to learn Saturday. Brit, thank you so much\u00a0great talking with you tonight.HUME: You bet Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So President Trump blasting China for the spread of the so-called China virus as he referred to it today in his UNGA address. He\u00a0called on the world to take notice. We are going to get reaction from H.R.\u00a0McMaster, his Former National Security Advisor, coming up next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: You saw my United\u00a0Nations speech. China should have stopped at their border. They should've\u00a0never let it spread all over the world and it's a terrible thing. Had we\u00a0not closed our country down and reopened and now we are doing well in\u00a0reopening, the stock market is up. All of those things but I think it's a\u00a0horrible thing.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: President Trump now wheels down in Pennsylvania. We're going to\u00a0take you there live in just a moment. But earlier today he went after China\u00a0on the world stage in his address to the United Nations General Assembly\u00a0drilling down on Beijing's failure to stop the spread of COVID-19, as the\u00a0U.S. today passes the death toll of 200,000 Americans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy, the China\u00a0virus. The Chinese government and the World Health Organization, which is\u00a0virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence\u00a0of human to human transmission. Later they falsely said people without\u00a0symptoms would not spread the disease. The United Nations must hold China\u00a0accountable for their actions.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Joining me now, President Trump's Former National Security\u00a0Advisor, Retired Three-Star General H.R. McMaster and Author of the new\u00a0book out today \"Battleground: The Fight To Defend The Free World\" General\u00a0McMaster good to have you with us and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0on the book sir.\u00a0H.R. MCMASTER, AUTHOR, \"BATTLEGROUNDS\": Hey thank you Martha, it's a\u00a0pleasure to be with you.MACCALLUM: So do you agree with the president when he calls at the China\u00a0virus and do you agree when he lays the blame for this virus and the havoc\u00a0that it's wreaked on our country at their feet?H.R. MCMASTER: Well, it's accurate to call it the China virus. I think\u00a0what's important to know is that the best way to deal with a pandemic is to\u00a0stop it before outcomes of pandemic at its source. And thanks to the\u00a0Chinese Communist Party, we couldn't do that.And so this is a virus that has been inflicted on the world by the Chinese\u00a0Communist Party's repression of the truth, repression of doctors who are\u00a0trying to warn about it the news of human to human transmission shutting\u00a0down domestic travel before they shut down international travel.\u00a0And so the Chinese Communist Party revealed I think it's irresponsibility\u00a0and of course the danger associated with its closed authoritarian system.MACCALLUM: All right. So we are now six weeks away from the United States\u00a0election. And \"The Washington Post\" reported today what it called a top\u00a0secret CIA assessment and cited two sources who reviewed that secret CIA\u00a0assessment that say we assessed that President Vladimir Putin in the senior\u00a0most Russian officials are aware of and probably directing Russia's\u00a0influence operations aimed at denigrating the former U.S. Vice President,\u00a0supporting the U.S. President, and fueling public discord ahead of the U.S.\u00a0election in November, says the first line of the document according to the\u00a0sources. What's your reaction to that finding and that report?H.R. MCMASTER: Well, we shouldn't be surprised at all. What Russia wants to\u00a0do first and foremost is shake our confidence, shake our confidence in our\u00a0democratic principles, our institutions, and our processes.I don't really think Vladimir Putin cares who wins the election as long as\u00a0Americans are torn apart by the result. And so you saw this in 2016. I\u00a0think they had it teed up to sow disinformation and propaganda about\u00a0Hillary Clinton winning the election because the election was rigged, you\u00a0know.But then of course when President Trump won, they had to adjust and then\u00a0they changed the story to well President Trump would have won the popular\u00a0vote if the election hadn't been rigged. So what they really want to do is\u00a0they want to decrease our confidence in who we are and they want to tear us\u00a0apart.MACCALLUM: So here is the president the other day talking about Vladimir\u00a0Putin at a rally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have been very rough but at the same time we get along. I like\u00a0Putin. He likes me. We get along. It's smart to get along. It's smart.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So a lot of people hear that he says I like Putin. He likes me.\u00a0It's off to the races with conspiracy theories. What's your reaction to\u00a0that first of all, do you see anything wrong in saying that? What message\u00a0does it send a Putin?H.R. MCMASTER: I don't understand it. I think it does play into Putin's\u00a0hands in large measure because Putin is the best liar in the world.\u00a0President Trump is the third of three presidents and he will eventually\u00a0figure this out. It came late to other presidents as well.You might remember President George W. Bush looking into Putin's soul or\u00a0President Obama leaning over to President Medvedev if he was keeping the\u00a0seat warm for President Putin to come back and saying hey I can work with\u00a0you more after the election or Secretary Clinton bringing the reset button.These are stories that I tell in \"Battlegrounds\" and it's the real argument\u00a0I'm making, is Vladimir Putin is not going to change? He is driven by\u00a0anger, a sense of honor lost during the collapse of the Soviet Union.He is determined since the time he took over in the year 2000 and now\u00a0extending his rule we think until at least 2036, he is determined to\u00a0restore Russia's national greatness. But you know what? Russia is not that\u00a0strong these days. They have a lot of problems.So the way Putin is going about it is he wants to drag everybody else down,\u00a0especially in Europe and especially the United States.MACCALLUM: So you say that you don't favor that kind of language, saying I\u00a0like Putin and he likes me. I know that you also in an interview that you\u00a0did a little while ago said he thought it would make Putin happy to hear\u00a0the president's response to a question about whether or not he thought that\u00a0Putin was sort of behind the poisoning of Alexey Navalny, the Opposition\u00a0Leader there, activist there.So why do you think that the president says these things so publicly if it\u00a0gives Vladimir Putin solace?H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know but I think what's important to recognize about\u00a0the Russian threat is that they want to disrupt us, right? They want to\u00a0shake our confidence and at the same time, deny it even their most obvious\u00a0and egregious actions.Remember this is a regime that shot down an airliner and murdered hundreds\u00a0of people and then just kept denying it even though there was\u00a0incontrovertible evidence. So I think it's important to pull the curtain\u00a0back on Russian activity and to be quite clear about it.I think for President Trump, sometimes he tries to separate the\u00a0relationship from issues at hand. You see that with other leaders that he\u00a0approaches where we have real big problems as well.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So you don't and there's anything nefarious and it?H.R. MCMASTER: No, I'm sorry go ahead.MACCALLUM: You don't think there's anything nefarious in it? Is that what\u00a0you're saying? I'm not putting words in your mouth.H.R. MCMASTER: Well, I don't know. I wish the president would be tougher on\u00a0Putin publicly because I think what Putin will do is he will push as much\u00a0as he can until there are costs imposed on him that are beyond those that\u00a0he factors in at the beginning of his decisions.I think this is backfiring on him. You mentioned the Navalny poisoning\u00a0using a military grade nerve agent like he did against Sergei Skripal in\u00a0March of 2018. If you remember, President Trump took very strong action.He closed the San Francisco Consulate which was a big intelligence\u00a0collection platform for the Russians. He kicked out 60 undeclared Russian\u00a0intelligence agents. And so I think those kinds of actions should speak\u00a0louder than words I hope. But the word sometimes, I don't understand.\u00a0MACCALLUM: OK. H.R. McMaster, the book is \"Battlegrounds\" thank you very\u00a0much and\u00a0congratulations\u00a0on the book. Good to have you with us. Hope you\u00a0join us again soon.H.R. MCASTER: Thank you so much, Martha.MACCALLUM: You bet. So we're going to you live to President Trump's remarks\u00a0at the rally in Pittsburgh coming up next. We also have some breaking news\u00a0that we will share with you right after the break. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:\u00a0 A bit of breaking news here. This is WMUR that is reporting\u00a0that Air Force 2 carrying the Vice President Mike Pence just returned to\u00a0the Manchester Boston Regional Airport after takeoff due to a possible bird\u00a0strike. Reporters traveling with the vice president were told that Air\u00a0Force 2 turn around after taking off because of an issue with the plane's\u00a0engine.\u00a0Pence and staff are now taking a cargo plane back to Washington according\u00a0to that reporting from WMUR in New Hampshire. So, we'll keep a close eye on\u00a0that.\u00a0As you see President Trump taking the stage in Moon Township in western\u00a0Pennsylvania tonight. Pennsylvania, of course, has 20 electoral votes at\u00a0stake. The president's opponent Joe Biden called an early lead today on\u00a0public events. That happened this morning. We have not seen him today\u00a0although he did do some virtual fund-raisers that were on his schedule. He\u00a0is currently up almost four points in the polling average in the Keystone\u00a0state.\u00a0President Trump hoping to turn that around and repeat 2016 where he eked\u00a0out a victory over Hillary Clinton by less than one point in the end. This\u00a0event is, like so many we have seen over the course of this campaign so\u00a0far, at Pittsburgh International Airport this time which is in Allegheny\u00a0County, one of the county -- one of the areas that Clinton outperformed\u00a0Trump in 2016. So, he is trying to make up some ground there and pick up a\u00a0few extra votes with this stop tonight.\u00a0Marc Thiessen is co-host of the American Enterprise Institute podcast What\u00a0the Hell is Going On, which is the question on all our lips these days as\u00a0every day gets more and more intense. Marc, great to see you.\u00a0MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Good to see you, Martha.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 As we watch the president about to take the podium here, your\u00a0thoughts on Pennsylvania, on the Supreme Court, what's on your mind\u00a0tonight?\u00a0THIESSEN:\u00a0 Yes. You know, Donald Trump in 2016, he won the presidency\u00a0because of 78,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. If it\u00a0hadn't been for that, he wouldn't be president right now. A large\u00a0percentage of those voters were voting on the Supreme Court.\u00a0The Supreme Court was the, if go back and look at the exit polls in 2016.\u00a0Donald -- Donald Trump won voters who for whom the Supreme Court was the\u00a0number one issue by 15 points. Twenty-six percent of his voters, that's\u00a0fifth -- that's almost 16 million people, said that was the number one\u00a0issue for them.This year it wasn't -- it was shaping up to not be as much of an issue\u00a0because he was so successful because he put two great justices on the\u00a0Supreme Court, he secured 200 judges on the lower courts. He seemed to have\u00a0succeed, he saved the conservative majority on the court and now all of a\u00a0sudden, the Supreme Court back front and center in the minds of a lot of\u00a0voters and especially with reluctant Trump voters.\u00a0There are lots of reluctant Trump voters who aren't big fans of Donald\u00a0Trump but care about the Supreme Court. This is going to drive those voters\u00a0back into Donald Trump's arms.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 We will see. Marc, standby. We're going to go to President\u00a0Trump --THIESSEN:\u00a0 OK.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 -- begin speaking right now in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.\u00a0DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\u00a0 How about the\u00a0Pittsburgh Steelers.\u00a0Congratulations.(CROWD CHEERING)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations. Good team. Great quarterback. Don't you think? I\u00a0think he's great. It's Big Ben, right? Big Ben. He's a good man. He is a\u00a0good man.Forty-two days from now we are going to win Pennsylvania.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 And we are going to win four more years in the White House. And we\u00a0are all entitled to it, I will tell you that. With your vote, we are going\u00a0to lift our nation to extraordinary new heights. We are going to turn the\u00a0page forever on the failed political class and that's exactly what we've\u00a0been doing.\u00a0And we're going to defend our jobs, our families, our borders and our\u00a0treasured way of life.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 And remember we now put America first. We do it. It's been a long\u00a0time.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 It's been a long time. This is the most important election in the\u00a0history of our country. I believe that. This election is a matter of\u00a0economic survival for Pennsylvania. You had the greatest year you've ever\u00a0had last year and you're really on your way. We were very, very sadly\u00a0disturbed by what happened with China. They left the plague out. They\u00a0shouldn't have done it.(CROWD BOOING)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0 But you are now underway. We closed it up. We save millions of\u00a0lives. That's the bottom line. We closed it up. We save millions of lives.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 And I will tell you see what's happening. You see the numbers as\u00a0well as I do. You are on your way to I think may be economically the best\u00a0year. This next year will be the best year we've had and the third quarter,\u00a0wait till you look at the third quarter. Look at the numbers. They will be\u00a0out before the election. But I predict they'll be very good.\u00a0By the way, if they are not, I deny ever said it. I deny it. But I'm pretty\u00a0confident they're going to be incredible, probably the best ever. Under my\u00a0administration, we proudly achieved energy independence.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Don't forget, I am not the candidate, two candidates that said we\u00a0are not going to have fracking. We're going to ban fracking and he said\u00a0that for a year.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Then all of a sudden, he said well maybe we'll have some fracking.\u00a0By the way, you know that's not going to last because the radical left\u00a0won't let him get away with it. And I'm all for fracking. You know, I was\u00a0in Texas.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, it's a big part of your economy. It's energy. It's a\u00a0tremendous part. But I was in Texas two few weeks ago and my opponent is\u00a0against oil, guns, and God.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 And I just spoke to the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, a great\u00a0guy. He said I think you're up 15, sir. I said well the fake news says I'm\u00a0up four. He said you're not up four. And I won by a lot last time. Remember\u00a0last time with you, with Texas, with many states. It's too close to call.\u00a0We don't know and then boom, the polls closed and they say Trump won, Trump\u00a0won, Trump. We won a lot. And --(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 And I won Pennsylvania. Because of you I won Pennsylvania and you\u00a0had your best year. So, I mean, that's the way it's supposed to work. And I\u00a0think we're going to win a lot. Last time I came in I said I was going to\u00a0give you the tax cuts, as regulation cuts. I said we're going to do big\u00a0things with energy, big things with steel.\u00a0Your steel mills, every one of them would have been closed and gone had I\u00a0not won. But I said I was going to do all these things. So, it's tougher.\u00a0Now I've done everything I said and more. I've done more. I've done more\u00a0than I said.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 So, this should be easier and I hear we are doing really well. I\u00a0know we are doing really well base in you know, we came in with a lot of\u00a0your great congressmen. I said how are we doing, they said you're going to\u00a0win by a lot. But we bet with it, we've got to go out, we've got to vote.\u00a0By powered by the incredible workers of your state, you are now really if\u00a0you look at it the number one producer. Think of it. We are as a nation,\u00a0your state, is -- you have no idea how big an energy -- do you know how big\u00a0you are in energy? People don't think of Pennsylvania that way. Do you have\u00a0any -- do you have any idea?\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 And as a nation we're the biggest in the world by far. Not even by\u00a0close. And we are energy independent. Think of that.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 But no longer is America at the mercy of these foreign suppliers\u00a0and all of the people that took advantage of us for so many years. We now\u00a0don't have to be in other parts of the world. We're there perhaps to help\u00a0allies. We're there perhaps to help good people. But we are not there\u00a0because we need their energy, because we need their oil.\u00a0Instead, we are the dominant energy producer. We are going to keep it that\u00a0way. We are always going to have it that way. This by the way, our\u00a0opponents, they don't want petroleum products. OK? They want wind. Let's\u00a0open up wind.(CROWD BOOING)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0 Let's have some wind, and every once in a while, a wind will blow\u00a0and you'll produce a couple things. And then you can -- then you close down\u00a0your plant for the rest of the season. You can watch those birds fly out of\u00a0the sky. Gee, I always say, it's a bird graveyard under the windmills,\u00a0doesn't have the power. It doesn't have the staying power.\u00a0You see what's happening in California. Blackouts, rolling blackouts. How\u00a0would you like that in Pennsylvania? The commonwealth of Pennsylvania?\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Darling, what's wrong? I can't watch Trump on television tonight. I\u00a0can't watch our president. Darling, we have a rolling blackout. It'll only\u00a0be a few hours. I think we'll be on by two o'clock in the morning, darling,\u00a0and we can watch a rerun.\u00a0Now this is what's happening. You have rolling blackouts. You have, in some\u00a0cases, just blackouts. They don't even call them rolling. Not going to\u00a0happen to your state.\u00a0Last year I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County,\u00a0Pennsylvania.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 The largest investment in your state's history. And that was all\u00a0made possible by our pro-energy policies. And we've done it a lot. In\u00a0Louisiana, we are building some of the largest, the largest plants you've\u00a0ever seen, largest in the world and it's incredible. All related to energy.\u00a0But your security and your jobs are in very grave peril because the radical\u00a0left maniacs, they don't want to have anything to do with energy. They\u00a0don't want anything to do with -- they have different concepts. Right? They\u00a0have the Green New Deal where there will be no energy almost of any kind.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Now it's crazy. I thought of AOC plus three. You know AOC?\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Not a good student. Not good at anything but she has a good line of\u00a0crap, I'll tell you that.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 She's got a hell of a lot. And she's got -- you know she's radical\u00a0left but she's not as bad as some of them. How about Omar of Minnesota?\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 We're going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 She's told us how to run our country. How did you do where you came\u00a0from? How was your country doing? They're going to tell, she's going to\u00a0tell us, she's telling us how to run our country.\u00a0And you know what, the Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are\u00a0doing? Their stance on Israel, it's like a whole different world. It's like\u00a0from 10 years ago, it's like a different world. And we want to keep our\u00a0world the way it was and the way it's going to be. We've got the greatest\u00a0country on earth and we're going to keep it that way.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 We don't need socialists and we don't need communists telling us\u00a0how to run our country.\u00a0(CROWD CHANTING)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0 You know, I do this every night and a lot of times it's a waste. I\u00a0did it last night. We were -- did you see the crowd we had last night? We\u00a0were in a great place, Ohio. And we had a crowd. We had a crowd you\u00a0couldn't see the end of it and I said turn around, camera. Turn around. But\u00a0they never liked doing that. You know, they don't like spinning those\u00a0cameras. They don't want to show the crowd.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 They don't like showing it. They don't like showing. Show the\u00a0crowd. And this is, it's an honor, let me tell you.(APPLAUSE)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0 Look.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Look, you know, I used to think there was a difficulty, like it was\u00a0a new camera that can't turn. But then whenever there was like a problem,\u00a0like there would be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person,\u00a0you don't see that much. I don't want to bring it on. But you don't see it\u00a0much anymore. You know why? It's dangerous. It's dangerous.\u00a0But you know, I'd see the camera would never move but when there's a little\u00a0negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel. And I\u00a0said, it does move. But they never want to show the crowds. They never --\u00a0last night. Now I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time.\u00a0The first lady, how did you like the crowds? Sir, I didn't see it. I didn't\u00a0see it. But I didn't see it, Donald. I didn't see it. Sometimes she will\u00a0call me Mr. President but she's only kidding, believe me. She's only\u00a0kidding. Has she been a great first lady, right?(CROWD CHEERING)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0 A great first lady and very popular. She's really done a great job\u00a0and she works hard. You know, we have some great people here tonight. I\u00a0brought certain members of my family but I'm going to introduce them to\u00a0you. OK?(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Great family. They work hard, I'll tell you, they work hard. They\u00a0really work hard. But I do wish, I do wish they would show because it would\u00a0be, you know it's actually better for them if they show. It shows the\u00a0importance. The only thing you can do, it's true, I'll say how did it look?\u00a0I don't know how he looked but the sound was phenomenal. OK? It sounded\u00a0like a Penn State football game. Like a Steelers football game.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 You know, you can't disguise it. Did you ever see sleepy Joe with\u00a0little circles? And puts them very far away. So far away. And then he comes\u00a0up with a mask. He's like 100 yards from the nearest human being. He's got\u00a0a mask. He feels good about the mask.\u00a0I wonder, in the debate, it'll be him and I on the stage. Is he going to\u00a0walk in with a mask? I'll be honest. He feels good about it. He feels good\u00a0about the mask and that's OK. You know what, whatever makes you feel good.\u00a0He feels good. He feels good.\u00a0I mean, honestly. What the hell did he spend all that money on the plastic\u00a0surgery if he's going to cover it up with a mask? Seriously, the whole\u00a0deal.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 Now, I think he will come in with a mask. I don't know. You have no\u00a0-- I have no idea. Well, the question is will he leave it on during the\u00a0debate because it's a little hard. And I'm all for mask, when you need\u00a0them, I'm all for it. But when you are making a speech and the nearest\u00a0person is like where you are and you're on the stage all by yourself and\u00a0then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he is\u00a0speaking.\u00a0He feels comfortable. It makes them feel comfortable. And you know\u00a0honestly, whatever makes you feel good is OK with me. But it will be\u00a0interesting. I'm going to be -- we're going to have a big rating on that.\u00a0And you know, he's been doing it all his life. He's been doing it for 47\u00a0years and I've just started doing this stuff.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 But you know, I'm just thinking. But I did more in 47 months than\u00a0he did in 47 years. It's true. It's true.(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 You look at what we have done.\u00a0(CROWD CHANTING)TRUMP:\u00a0 No, it's true. That's actually true. He did a lot of negative stuff\u00a0too. You have to deduct that out. When asked if there would be any place\u00a0for fossil fuels, including coal, fracking, in a Biden administration, Joe\u00a0replied no. We would make sure that it's all eliminated.\u00a0All of a sudden, he gets the nomination. You know, he's been trying to get\u00a0the nomination for decades. He finally gets it. That was prime time for him\u00a0which was never great. He never got more than 1 percent. We called him,\u00a0remember I called him, his first nickname was 1 percent Joe.\u00a0And frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy which is\u00a0radical left socialism, perhaps communism. I don't know, perhaps. It's\u00a0verging on communism, right? But had she been loyal, she would've left. She\u00a0would've quit. She had no chance. She was out. Pocahontas, she was gone.\u00a0Remember, I said I have more Indian blood in me then you have and I have\u00a0none. And I'd love to have some but I don't happen to have any. And then\u00a0she choked and she went out and got a test and she announced she had 1024,\u00a0right, 1,000. That means like, I said it last night that means around 700\u00a0or 800 years ago somewhere there was a little bit of a relationship going.\u00a0That's OK.\u00a0Seven hundred or 800 years ago may be. What a phony she is. Isn't she\u00a0terrible? And now we are going to pick a great woman, any one of the five\u00a0that I told you but anyone of the women that we had.(CROWD CHEERING)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0 They are all great people, great scholars. Great, brilliant people.\u00a0(CROWD CHANTING)TRUMP:\u00a0 A lot of people. Now they're all great women. They are brilliant,\u00a0great scholars. By the way, while I'm here, would anybody prefer that I\u00a0pick a man? Is there any man that has the courage to raise your hand?\u00a0There's one right there. I've got one. We found one.\u00a0No, we are going to pick an incredible, brilliant woman. And watch the\u00a0abuse that she will take. Whoever, it's going -- the decision is going to\u00a0be announced on Saturday. Five o'clock on Saturday at the White House.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 And you see we have tremendous Republican support. Two people, you\u00a0know, it's always got to be two, always got to be the two, those two. We\u00a0have great support from the Republican Party, tremendous support. It's ever\u00a0been this unified before, ever, ever. In the fake impeachment, we had 196\u00a0to nothing Republican support. And we had 52 and a half to a half in the\u00a0Senate. Who was the half? I can't imagine? I can't. But he was very good\u00a0today, I have to tell you. He's good. Now I'm happy. Thank you, Mitt. Thank\u00a0you. Now he's very good, very positive statement.\u00a0But days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon\u00a0emissions. That's basically saying, you know what that is, there will be no\u00a0more oil, there will be no more gas, there will be no more nothing. There\u00a0will be no more industry. There will be no more country, that's what he's\u00a0saying really.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 And that would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining\u00a0immediately in Pennsylvania, sending your jobs overseas, sending your money\u00a0to somebody else, not you. And I'll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where\u00a0they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 But I can say the same because you are really big in energy and I\u00a0can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas. So, they don't want oil.\u00a0They don't want fracking. Right? They don't want the energy that we know\u00a0that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful. It's\u00a0not going to do it. It's not going to do it.\u00a0So, they don't like oil. They don't like gas. They don't like God,\u00a0religion. Churches are closed.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 How about these states? You know, they still have churches -- by\u00a0the way, your governor hasn't been so great, you know that, right?\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 Are your church is still closed? They are still closed. They are\u00a0doing it for a reason. By the way, November 4th, they will announce we've\u00a0decided to open up. OK? They are trying to make our numbers as bad as\u00a0possible so California is closed. Pennsylvania is closed, North Carolina is\u00a0closed. Michigan is closed. That's another beauty right there. Michigan is\u00a0closed.\u00a0And then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots. By\u00a0the way, when, not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your\u00a0authorities. OK? The real authorities. They are watching. And the\u00a0authorities are watching. But please report it.But when you look at it, really, it's amazing and they are trying to make\u00a0our numbers look bad but even with numerous closed states. And you notice\u00a0also law and order, right, law and order? The red states, the Republican\u00a0states, they are working great, record low crime, record low.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 But Democrat run states, you look at Chicago. You look at New York.\u00a0New York has gone through -- we have to bring back -- we should draft Rudy\u00a0Giuliani, OK?\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP:\u00a0 We want Rudy.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP:\u00a0 They -- Rudy. Rudy, I'll tell you. Rudy is amazing. But he did a\u00a0great job. New York was in great trouble. He came in and he was tough,\u00a0smart, and it became the safest big city and now we have a man where some\u00a0categories of crime were up 300 percent. He fired a thousand. He fired a\u00a0lot of police. I guess a billion dollars a year worth of police, a lot of\u00a0great police, firemen and women.\u00a0It's a terrible thing. I love that place so much and it's so sad to see\u00a0what's happening to New York. We are going to make a little bit of a play\u00a0for New York. You know, in theory, they automatically, the Democrats\u00a0automatically win New York.\u00a0But I do phenomenally in most parts and in one part it's automatic, but I\u00a0can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy so we are\u00a0going to make a play for New York.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 With Pennsylvania, I don't have to make a play. We've got\u00a0Pennsylvania.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP:\u00a0 We don't have to make a play. We don't have to. It's a great -- you\u00a0know, for years, though, Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just\u00a0didn't win. And for many years, everybody thought they were going to win.\u00a0Every Republican, we are going to win Pennsylvania. They thought they were\u00a0going to win it and they didn't. And I came along and we won it, and we won\u00a0it quite easily.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, joining me now with some reaction to what we're watching\u00a0here tonight from President Trump in Pennsylvania, Marc Thiessen, American\u00a0Enterprise Institute scholar and Fox News contributor, and Ed Rendell,\u00a0former governor of Pennsylvania and former DNC chairman.\u00a0Ed, let me start with you. The president going right to the issue of\u00a0fracking. He said that Joe Biden would eliminate fracking, all of that\u00a0would end immediately he said, it would be shut down. And just was going\u00a0through a number of comments from Joe Biden who has evolved dramatically on\u00a0this issue.\u00a0In the past he said, we would make sure that it is eliminated. And that has\u00a0sort of slowly evolving to no new fracking. So, how big of an issue is this\u00a0in Pennsylvania in front of this, a very large crowd, I would say tonight.\u00a0ED RENDELL, FORMER CHAIRMAN, DNC:\u00a0 Well, it's a big issue because fracking\u00a0has been very beneficial for Pennsylvania.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.RENDELL:\u00a0 I was a governor who allowed fracking to start and it boomed\u00a0under my last two years. But Joe Biden is against fracking. Donald Trump is\u00a0lying. He knows he's lying. He was exposed by Chris Wallace on the Sunday\u00a0show on Fox News. Chris Wallace made him say where did Joe Biden say he was\u00a0against fracking, Donald Trump couldn't come up with any evidence to Joe\u00a0Biden. He never said he was against fracking. In fact --(CROSSTALK)\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Well, no. Ed, you know, that may be the case but I'm looking at\u00a0this last year debate with Dana Bash who was asked him about fossil fuels\u00a0and his answer was we would make sure it's eliminated. And I'm just\u00a0pointing out that over time his answers have started changing and evolving.\u00a0Some might say flip-flopping on that issue.\u00a0RENDELL:\u00a0 But wait.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, he did hold that position. He may not anymore but he did.\u00a0RENDELL:\u00a0 Martha, Donald Trump when he was a New Yorker was for -- was pro-choice. He was pro-choice for years and years and years. He said --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:\u00a0 That's fine. So, you're saying it's OK to change your opinion\u00a0and I'm just pointing out that's what's happening.\u00a0RENDELL:\u00a0 But you should point out to your listeners that Joe Biden said\u00a0from the first day he announced that he will not stop fracking in\u00a0Pennsylvania. He said it on the Sunday show with Chris Wallace on Fox News.\u00a0Chris Wallace exposed Donald Trump as a liar.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. Well that, my point is that the position has changed\u00a0over time which we hear a lot from politicians. Marc, your thoughts on\u00a0this?\u00a0THIESSEN:\u00a0 Yes, he's -- in a debate with Bernie Sanders in March, Bernie\u00a0Sanders said that I will -- it will make -- I will make sure that we stop\u00a0fracking as soon as we possibly can. And Joe Biden chimed in and said no,\u00a0no, so will I.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 That's correct.THIESSEN:\u00a0 He said no new fracking. So, you know, the idea that he has been\u00a0consistent on this is wrong because he was saying it as recently as March.\u00a0And look, the reality is --\u00a0(CROSSTALK)RENDELL:\u00a0 Because he will --THIESSEN:\u00a0 The Democratic Party is hostile to fossil fuels. They want to\u00a0eliminate fossil fuels. They want to -- they want to do it through\u00a0government mandates as opposed through free-market innovation. And this\u00a0would not only devastate Pennsylvania and other states. It would harm our\u00a0national security. We are stronger --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right.THIESSEN:\u00a0 -- again, vis-a-vis China, vis-a-vis Russia, vis-a-vis Saudi\u00a0Arabia because America is an energy superpower and they want to -- they\u00a0want energy disarmament.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. Sorry to jump in. And I need a quick 30-second\u00a0answer from both of you on this.\u00a0THIESSEN:\u00a0 Yes.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 The crowd is very large there tonight. There is no mistaking\u00a0that, Ed. The president says he believes he's ahead in Pennsylvania. Joe\u00a0Biden put a lid on his campaign day today early this morning. Is that going\u00a0to be a problem for him?\u00a0RENDELL:\u00a0 No. It's going to be close in Pennsylvania. I've told you that\u00a0from the beginning when Joe Biden was up by 10 points. Donald Trump has a\u00a0strong following in Pennsylvania. And anybody who wants to defeat him\u00a0better get out and vote.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Marc, your thoughts on the polls and what we're seeing here\u00a0tonight?\u00a0THIESSEN:\u00a0 I agree with the governor, it's going to be very tight and the\u00a0Supreme Court is going to make a big, big difference with a lot of\u00a0conservative Democrats in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Ohio and\u00a0Wisconsin and other states like that who want a conservative justice on the\u00a0Supreme Court.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0(CROSSTALK)RENDELL:\u00a0 That's what they said --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Go ahead. Quick thought, Ed.RENDELL:\u00a0 That's what they said about Kavanaugh. The Kavanaugh hearings --\u00a0(CROSSTALK)THIESSEN:\u00a0 Democrats lost the (Inaudible) because of Kavanaugh.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. We'll see. Thank you very much, gentlemen, for\u00a0watching along with us. Ed Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania.THIESSEN:\u00a0 Thank you.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 And Marc Thiessen.\u00a0That is THE STORY for Tuesday, September 22nd. Glad to have you with us.\u00a0THE STORY goes on as you know. So, I'll be back here tomorrow night and I\u00a0hope you will too. Have a great night, everybody.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" September 1, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We sure will, it looks great out there. Bret. Great show tonight. Here we go, folks. 63 days until the election. So, how many news cycles does 2020 have in store for us between now and Election Day? It's anybody's guess because in January, this remember was going to be the deciding factor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CA, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: So today, we will make history. When we walked down - when the managers walked down the hall, we cross a threshold in history delivering articles of impeachment against the President of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, who can forget that procession down the hall? Remember that. But then with the economy taking off like a rocket post impeachment, it started to blur the past and made victory look very likely. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How often have we seen a president in office who has a strong economy, who has a hard time getting a second term. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: But then came the virus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have it very much under control in this country. I am officially declaring a national emergency. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Then the violence that it spawned with almost 30 million people out of work, the killing of George Floyd, all of that creating a tinderbox that then exploded across the streets of cities in America, Portland, Seattle, New York, D.C. But something shifted when it came to Kenosha, Kenosha, Wisconsin. (VIDEO PLAYING) Salena Zito, a Washington Examiner writing this, that Kenosha could change this election because it represents every men of America's mid-sized cities. When people see Kenosha, they see their hometown, their suburb, their schools, their middle America, and they wonder by the grace of God, there goes the country, she writes. President Trump spent the day there today. Joe Biden says that he hopes that he will visit soon. When you see the wide shot of that picture that was in there, it is a bunch of burned out buildings on the streets of Kenosha. We're going to pull up that in just a second, so you can get a real look at the president there today. In 16 days, absentee ballots are going to hit the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, where President Trump trails right now by over three points. Hogan Gidley is the Trump Campaign's National Press Secretary. Hogan, good to see you tonight, as always. So, you have that that image today, which we're going to put up of the president standing before the people whose businesses are burned out. It looks like he's standing in the middle of Beirut. But as Salena Zito writes, this is unbelievably happening in Kenosha, Wisconsin. It's also true that according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, the president is down there by 3.5. HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Again, we take issue with the polling for sure. But I would tell you that the politics of this has really shifted things for the Democrats and the Biden campaign. It's not about politics for this president. It's about the American people. Donald Trump cares about their safety and security. 90 days, this has been going on, Martha. Death, destruction, looting, rioting, assaults on innocent Americans. The Democrats had a convention for four days, said nothing about it. Democrat convention, Democrat controlled cities, not a word. Joe Biden called them peaceful protests again this weekend. And then that politics started to shift. Turns out the American people don't like it when their cities are set ablaze by rioters and protesters and looters and all the like. And what happened? Biden had to come out and say there was a little violence sprinkled in with all the mostly peaceful protesters. And then the media jumped right in with them and said, yes, not only is there violence, it's Donald Trump's fault. Who do they think they're kidding? You're playing video right now-- MACCALLUM: Let me plat that. I want to play that video, Hogan. GIDLEY: There's not a single Donald Trump T-shirt in any of the video you're playing. It's all pro-Biden supporters are doing this to our America. MACCALLUM: This is Joe Biden. This is what Hogan Gidley is referring to here. This is Joe Biden in Pittsburgh. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This is a sitting president of the United States of America. He's supposed to be protecting his country, but instead he's rooting for chaos and violence. The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So, now he's trying to scare America. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, in Kenosha, one of the things that set this off obviously was the death of Jacob Blake. His uncle came out today. He said, we don't want to hear anything from - he called him the orange man. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't have any words for the orange man. All I ask is that he keep his disrespect, his foul language, far away from my family. We need a president that's going to unite our country and take us in a different direction. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, what do you say to both of those, Hogan? GIDLEY: Look, Joe Biden has been in office for half of a century and nothing has improved. He has nothing to point to as any type of substantial victory for the American people at all. And to hear him talk right now, I mean, who does he think he's fooling, for that matter? He hasn't said a word about this for this entire time period, 90 days, three months this has been going on. He pops up out of the hidey hole every once in a while, to say, let's defund the police and blame the police, calling them the instigators of some of this violence. And what did they think was going to happen? Democrats now for years, Maxine Waters, saying if you see someone in the administration get in their face, tell them they're not welcome here, cause a scene. You had Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential nominee, the pick by Joe Biden, saying this is not going to stop. It shouldn't stop. It should keep going. They want the chaos. They are rooting for chaos because they think it falls back on the president. But again, this vice presidential, this Vice President Joe Biden is completely oblivious to where the American people are on this. They want safety, security. They demand it. The government is supposed to provide safety and security for those who can't provide it themselves. And by the way, when you're talking about these cities, the president has offered help at every turn to try and squash this violence-- MACCALLUM: Yes, he's made that very clear-- (CROSSTALK) GIDLEY: And then when he doesn't come in, they say it's all his fault. You can't have it both ways. MACCALLUM: What's your response to Jacob Blake's uncle? GIDLEY: Which part? MACCALLUM: He said he doesn't want to hear anything from President Trump and to keep his divisiveness where it is, that's what he just said. GIDLEY: Look, the President of the United States is the only one trying to unify people behind an uplifting, patriotic message. This country is a great place. It's Democrats who say it's inherently evil, that it's the cause of the world's problems. And we fundamentally disagree. Of course, this country has challenges, but what's unique about America is that we get through them together. We come out stronger. After all, all of the issues we face. The president is not only the consoler in chief, which you saw today in Wisconsin, but he also understands the American people deserve law and order. They deserve safety and security. He's been for that his entire time in office. He'll be there for the American people for the next one as well. MACCALLUM: I want to try to get in two quick questions if I can. Kyle Rittenhouse, a couple of pieces written today that by Republican supporters who say that they're concerned that the president opening the door to being supportive of that young man walking down the street with his rifle and how things ended up. And we don't know. We're waiting for the investigation. But the president sort of opened up the door to that, to being supportive to him. Was that a mistake? Some Republicans saying today that they concerned that it might have been a mistake in Wisconsin to voters there. GIDLEY: Well, a couple of things. And you hit on one of them. Look, we want to wait for the investigation. The president was very clear about that. He also said that citizens should not take matters into their own hands. He wants the brave men and women of the law enforcement to handle this. The problem is these Democrat mayors, Democrat governors have said, don't do your job. You can't use non-lethal means; you can't use lethal means. And the police are standing down. We saw a blue out in Atlanta where everyone just didn't show up for work. That's unacceptable. So, the president wants just-- MACCALLUM: So, the president does not want people, does not want civilians to take this into their own hands, is what I'm hearing you say today. I'm not sure he said it as clearly as you did just there. GIDLEY: He said it last night on Laura. He sure did. He said he wants the law enforcement to handle this. Absolutely. MACCALLUM: OK. Last question. The Walter Reed visit that has been written about in this new book, you were there in the White House at the time. Why did the president go to Walter Reed that day? GIDLEY: I'm not sure which instance you're talking about, the one where they tried to claim that he had some type of ailment? MACCALLUM: Yes, that's what I'm referring to. GIDLEY: Well, I'm with the president a lot. He's the healthiest man I know. And you saw the doctor, Sean Conley come out. He's one of the best physicians on the planet say that this is absolutely ludicrous. For someone in the media to make such a dangerous, ridiculous, irresponsible claim and see no ramification at all. No fallout from CNN. Joe Lockhart, what a despicable human being to try and float this out there. A rumor about the president's health. You see him every single day. He's out for hours at a time. Joe Biden is sitting down in a basement somewhere, pops up every so often to say a couple of words here and there, takes no questions. If anyone has an issue, it's obviously Joe Biden because he won't face the music with the media. But for someone to make that type of allegation against this president I think is quite frankly disgusting. He owes the president, this country an apology. And quite frankly, he should be fired. MACCALLUM: And I would direct people to Sean Conley's statement, which was pretty emphatic. Hogan Gidley, thank you very much. Always good to have you here. GIDLEY: Absolutely. MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, President Trump's push to put power into the hands of parents when it comes to their children's education. We're going to speak with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos exclusively tonight when \u201cThe Story\u201d continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: It is September 1st. Can you believe it? It's back to school time, and this year it's fraught with a huge desire to get back to normal, to have kids in school and a battle with some teacher's unions that are pushing back. In an open letter to America's parents, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos writes, no one is suggesting that every single child must be behind a desk in a classroom or that health realities on the ground won't cause temporary disruptions. We do, however, believe as the rule, schools must be open for in-person learning as an option for the families who want it or who need it, your child, your school, your way. Education Secretary Betsy Davos joins me now. Secretary, good to have you with us this evening. Thank you for being here. BETSY DEVOS, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, school choice is getting a lot of attention right now for a number of reasons, I think because COVID-19 has made people aware of the choices that they could potentially have to go to different schools. And I know that you and the president want to make those dollars portable. Joe Biden does not want those dollars to be portable. Here is what he had to say about your program. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: If I'm president, Betsy DeVos' whole notion from charter schools to this are gone. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, what do you say to him about that? And are you in favor of letting people use their tax dollars that they've paid into education to go to private school or to go to religious school? DEVOS: Well, Martha, Joe Biden probably doesn't remember it, but in 1997, he gave an impassioned speech on the Senate floor in favor of school choice. Today, he's turned his back on the kids that we're talking about and he's turned his face in favor of the teacher's union and what they have to say and what they have to demand. And it's really shameful. Parents are demanding more choices today as their schools across the country are not serving them and the needs of their students. And we're seeing parents forming learning pods, micro schools, doing home schooling, trying to access schools for which they have to pay tuition in small faith- based schools and other things, other schools. And so, the demand for school choice and giving parents the control about their - for their kids' future is continuing to grow. And it's a really important point in time. MACCALLUM: Yes, I think a lot of people are waking up to all of this and wanting more options. The 1997 speech that you talked about. He said, you know, I'm only asking if public education is still the only answer when he talked about what the other options might be out there. But here's Randi Weingarten. New York City, they've just delayed the opening for 10 days to prevent a strike. I don't know what 10 more days is going to do in terms of the education of the kids here in New York City or them getting what they want, the teachers, but they're going to get 10 more days. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDI WEINGARTEN, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: The Democrats actually came to the table with the 400 billion that was needed. They didn't - the president walked away from doing schools in his executive order. He didn't do anything about schools. MACCALLUM: All right. WEINGARTEN: We know that schools need the money and we know that kids need it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: They can help, and they need the money, Betsy. DEVOS: Well, the president and this administration have been in favor of the resources needed to ensure kids can get back to school, and the reality is that there were $13 billion in the CARES Act that have gone primarily, largely unspent so far. And that can certainly be applied to getting kids back to school. It's an excuse for the most part. And again, the reality is that parents and their kids are being held hostage and captive in too many places by the teacher's unions fears and their own agendas. MACCALLUM: So, the other big issue is content that people are becoming more aware of what their kids are learning in school and what they're not learning in school, because a lot of times they're teaching them themselves and getting an up close look at the curriculum. We put this up yesterday, but it really struck me in the Wall Street Journal editorial and a teacher in Philadelphia said that he tweeted out his concern that conservative parents listening in are my chief concern to his lessons. Here's what the president had to say about something that is kind of a new idea. I mean, in a way, he's coining it patriotic education. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our nation's schools where they're trying to change everything that we have learned. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: How are you going to do that, Secretary DeVos? DEVOS: Again, giving parents the control over where their kids learn and what they're learning. It's been revealed to more and more parents today what kids are - what's actually going on in their schools or in many cases not going on. And its even greater argument for giving parents those choices and for promoting and advancing school choice in a meaningful way today. MACCALLUM: So, I mean, right now it looks like school choice is impossible. A lot of efforts have been put forth. So, it looks like the only way to achieve that would be to get some different - for people to vote for people who are in favor of that, I would imagine. Right. DEVOS: Well, we're very hopeful that all of those members of Congress are going to see the need for parents to have the choices and the control for their kids' education. And I'm very hopeful that when they come back to the table, they're going to do what's right for parents and kids and ensure that we're investing in the future of all of the kids in this country and allowing them to learn in the places, in the ways that are going to work for them. MACCALLUM: I think parents have seen a lot of new options out there and a lot of ways to craft their education the way that they see fit. We will see where this goes. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, thank you very much. September 1st. DEVOS: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: Back to school time. All right. So, Joe Biden lays into President Trump for unrest in America, calling for peace, but he doesn't mention Black Lives Matter or ANTIFA who are largely responsible for the violence that we have seen on the streets so far. There are other groups, but they are the main groups out there. Deroy Murdock and Juan Williams debate coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Joe Biden changed his tune considerably on violence when he spoke in Pittsburgh, when he talked about the United States cities that are on fire, but his comments did draw some scrutiny for what the former vice president failed to mention. The Wall Street Journal editorial board today writes this. Surely Mr. Biden knows that the protests and riots this Memorial Day are overwhelmingly led by Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA. Mr. Biden didn't mention those groups in his prepared remarks, and he never used the words Left-wing to describe those who are burning businesses and attacking police precincts. Here's some of what Mr. Biden did say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: He's got no problem with Right-wing militia, white supremacists, and vigilantes with assault weapons often better armed than the police, often in the middle of the violence. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now, Deroy Murdock, contributing editor to National Review Online and a Fox News Contributor and Juan Williams, co-host of The Five and a Fox News political analyst. Deroy, let me start with you. What did you make of what was in his statement and what was left out? DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I was struck by the fact that he blamed this, I didn't point any blame at Black Lives Matter, at Antifa, any of these Left-wing groups. They claim that these are Right-wing groups doing it. Are these Right-wing groups burning the American flag? Maybe the American Legion doing so. We've seen churches attack. We've seen statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ decapitated. Is that the focus of the family doing this? This is absolute sort of bizarre. I mean, it's one thing for him not to speak up over these last three months, but then finally to speak up as he has yesterday, and then turn around and blame it on President Trump and his supporters. I think it's astonishing. And one of the things he completely forgot to mention is how President Trump repeatedly has said things that are designed to try to soothe the situation and calm people down. For example, May 30th, just after these riots started, he said in Cape Canaveral, I quote, the memory of George Floyd being dishonored by rioters, looters, and anarchists. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos is the mission at hand. And he's repeatedly said things like this, trying to lower the temperature and get people to be unified. Unfortunately, most of the media don't cover this. They do cover, of course, the riots on the other side will claim that they're peaceful or mostly peaceful, even though so many of these incidents end up with graffiti, broken windows, burned buildings. And just a couple of nights ago in Portland, with the Trump supporter being shot dead in the streets by Antifa activist, by the way. MACCALLUM: Juan, he said in that same speech, Joe Biden, I'm not a radical socialist. Do I look like a radical socialist? He said. So then why would it be difficult to talk about these groups? It ought to be natural for someone who portrays himself that way to be able to say, I am not the radical formers of Black Lives Matter and I am not Antifa, and these people are burning down buildings and ruining people's lives and they need to stop. Why not just say it? JUAN WILLIAMS, \u201cTHE FIVE\u201d CO-HOST: Well, first of all, he did say that looting, rioting, setting buildings on fire is wrong and it's a crime, and the people who do it ought to be not only arrested, but prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. He said that quite plainly. But I think that what you're saying is curious to me, because I read in the newspaper today that the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that it's like 90 percent, 90 percent, Martha, of the incidence of crime and the rioting, the violence are responsibility of Right-wing militia groups in this country. And it's just to me astonishing that President Trump is the one who is quick to say, oh-- MACCALLUM: Those numbers are not referring to what's happening in the cities. Yes, there's numbers are not referring to these incidents on what we're watching and what we're covering for the last three months. WILLIAMS: I'm telling you this country is really experiencing a wave of Right-wing violence. We saw two men killed, two men killed in Kenosha by a young man, 17, who identified himself as part of a militia pro police. MACCALLUM: And he's under investigation - that's a heinous situation. And nobody is-- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Martha, has President Trump once said that that young man did something wrong? He's been given every opportunity-- MACCALLUM: He said, it's under investigation. I just questioned Hogan Gidley about exactly that question, but I do want to get to one of the thing with both of you, because I think these comments are interesting, because during the RNC, we heard from Nikki Haley, we heard from Tim Scott, we heard from Jack Brewer saying that there is not systemic racism in the United States, but that notion has become overblown, that it is not true of this country on the whole. And now, there's some pushback on that idea. And one of the - a piece of it comes from a podcast that was just a casual conversation between Michelle Obama and her friends and another one from Kamala Harris that we have for you to listen to and respond to. Let's play those. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY: What white folks don't understand is that -- that is so telling of how white America views people who are not like them. You know, we don't exist. And when we do exist, we exist as a threat. That, that's exhausting. KAMALA HARRIS, DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human. And we have yet to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Never been treated as fully human, and Michelle Obama was referred to -- referred to -- you know, she and her friends being -- someone cut in front of them in line at an ice cream score, and that was what prompted that comment. Deroy? DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I just find it astonishing that this woman was the first lady of the United States, as deeply racist, bigoted country, elected her husband president of the United States in 2008 and reelected in 2012 comfortably, the same racist nation elected Kamala Harris, the attorney general of California and now the U.S. senator from California, now she's the V.P. nominee. So somehow despite this racism they make it, I wish they would encourage other folks who are black, that there are possibilities you can make in this country, rather than whine and moan about systemic racism that they pick, that they dent. MACCALLUM: Quick comment, Juan, before we go. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I mean, we live in a troubled time here, obviously, if we think about George Floyd, if you think about Jacob Blake, if you think about Breonna Taylor, these people were killed, and it's shocking to me. This -- I just saw a baseball player for the Mets, and he said it feels like they are hunting us. You know, LeBron James, the famous basketball player, said this is -- this racism in this country is out of control. Why won't white people acknowledge it? MACCALLUM: All right. You know, I think that people are seeing things in very different ways, and I think that's part of what is going on in the country, and we all have to really listen to each other here. I'm going to have to leave it there, but we'll pick it up next time. Juan Williams and Deroy Murdock, gentlemen, thank you very much for being here today. Coming up, Portland police reportedly investigating a person of interest who self-described as 100 percent antifa in connection with the killing of a protester there who lost his life. DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec on the attorney general's vow to quell the violence and the new rules rolled out -- rolled out today to make it tougher for the FBI to surveil politicians and American citizens and their campaigns, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: When we are able to identify people who have committed crimes in these riots going all the way back to the beginning, whether they are burning police cars or throwing rocks at people, which are deadly, they will be prosecuted. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Attorney General Bill Barr vowing to hold these perpetrators accountable. Just last night in Portland, police declared a riot as protests stretched into the 96th night there. Rioters gathered outside the mayor's home, Ted Wheeler, who basically had supported them since day one. They were calling for his resignation, and it was a birthday party, of sorts. The rioters also set fires two bundles of newspapers, they threw them into the ground floor of a residential building, in the act, they torched a minority owned business called Pearl District Dental. They broke the windows, they looted the stores in the area, so what started out as a peaceful protest became something quite different in the evening there. Meanwhile, police are reportedly investigating this man, an antifa supporter, Michael Reinoehl, as a person of interest in the killing of Patriot Prayer member Aaron Danielson this weekend. DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec joins us now. Kerri, good to have you here tonight. KERRI KUPEC, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: Good to be with you. MACCALLUM: You know, what can you tell us about these ongoing investigations into the murders, the Kyle Rittenhouse situation is also under investigation, as well, and the efforts to figure out who is behind all of this? KUPEC: The Department of Justice is assisting in those investigations and we are investigating coordinated criminal activity related to riots, destruction of federal property, assault of federal law enforcement officers. We obviously don't prosecute ideology or groups, but we certainly prosecute and certainly investigate criminal activity. And, Martha, part of this is following the money. So, what does that mean? That means examining the financial transactions related to this coordinated criminal activity. For instance, some of the materials that have been used in these riots, how are they purchased? Where is this money coming from? Who is behind that? And working our way up. And the Department of Justice is aggressively pursuing all of the avenues with respect to these investigations. MACCALLUM: So, the president talked about people dressed in black that were seen on airplanes traveling from one location to the other. What is the DOJ know about that? And do you think that there are, sort of, you know, nationwide funding organizations behind these groups? KUPEC: We're certainly, as I said, tracing the money and following the money as an integral part of examining coordinated criminal activity, the likes of which we've seen in Portland, and we've made over 100 arrests in Portland. We've charge 76 individuals. More charges are coming this week. This is part of 300 arrests, over 300 arrests nationally, over 300 defendants charged, as well, and so the Department of Justice, the FBI, ATF, and all of our components are committed to aggressively pursuing, investigating -- MACCALLUM: Yes. KUPEC: -- and prosecuting this violence, because it's unacceptable. MACCALLUM: So, if you find out that somebody is buying them tickets and paying for their hotel rooms and all of that kind of thing, is there criminal charges that can be brought against the person who is doing that, though? KUPEC: Well, yes, and we look at crimes and the federal crimes is being committed, and federal crimes include, you know, assault in federal law enforcement officers, arson. We have a number of arson investigations, particularly in Kenosha, and so that's something that we look at. But again, the materials, and you show these videos on your show, Martha, as have other networks as well, we've seen some of these materials that have been used in these riots, and it's not just that a pallet of bricks magically appear on a street corner, right? Somebody has had to purchase those. MACCALLUM: Right. KUPEC: It indicates coordinated activity, and so the FBI continues to watch video footage of what has happened in Portland and other places in order to thoroughly investigate what's going on and who is behind it. MACCALLUM: A lot of questions out there about who is behind it, exactly. Before I let you go, the FBI came out today with sort of new guidelines in terms of FISA applications and the like. And, you know, tightening the ability to surveil American citizens, members of campaigns. Any thoughts on that, that guidance, and does that in any way indicate that the Durham report is going to be close behind? KUPEC: Yes. So, a couple thoughts on that. So in addition to the inspector general's review, in addition to the 40 plus reforms that Director Wray has already enacted and is implementing, in addition to John Durham's investigation, the attorney general determined it was necessary to implement additional reforms at the FBI to make sure that what happened to President Trump and his campaign never happens again. This includes the creation of an audit office within the FBI, and what that office will be doing is conducting oversight of national security activities, FISA applications, and the like. The inspector general will be reviewing the activities of that office after eight months to make sure it's properly functioning. And in addition, on the FISA piece of things, if the FBI seeks a FISA warrant on an elected official on member of a campaign or a candidate, they will need to get permission from the attorney general to do so. MACCALLUM: Kerri Kupec, thank you. Always good to see you, Kerri. KUPEC: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Officer Tamaris Bohanon, 29 years old, shot in the head and killed in the line of duty this week. He left behind a wife and three young children. So where is the protest for T., as he was known to his family? Former St. Louis County Police Chief, Ron Battelle on the legacy that Officer Bohanon leaves behind, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: St. Louis Police Officer Tamaris Bohanon was responding to a call of a shooting on Saturday evening when he was shot in the head and killed. Twenty-year-old officer leaves behind a grieving family who shared a handwritten message, reading in part, he is a hero to many, but most importantly, to his loving wife and three incredible children. They are under the age of 10. A suspect with a lengthy criminal record believed to be on the run from Florida has been charged with his murder. Here now former St. Louis County Police Chief, Ron Battelle, executive director of The Backstoppers, a non-profit working to help Officer Bohanon's family. Chief Patel, good to have you here this evening. Your thoughts on this perpetrator and what happened here? RON BATTELLE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE BACKSTOPPERS INC.: Well, the perpetrator should never have been out there to begin with, that's my number one thought, and my second thought is he killed one of our St. Louis police officers. And Officer Bohannon, he was called T by his family, he was called Bo by his fellow officers, but he was a committed officer who was dedicated to the community and tried to make it better, loved his family, three kids, just a tragic deal. MACCALLUM: Beautiful family. We're just looking at pictures of them now, it's unbelievable. BATTELLE: Yes. MACCALLUM: This is Steve Haag who owns the home that this perpetrator ran into you and these homeowners ran out the back. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE HAAG, HOMEOWNER TARGETED BY GUNMAN: He left us alone. I can only say he wanted to draw the police's attention. And once the police came, then he went after the main agenda, which was the officers. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The police association says that he was a difference maker, he was a serve -- a public servant who will be mourned by all, because his life mattered. Just a final thought, sir, on, you know, what you see happening out there with blue lives matter and black lives matter, what do you think about all of this? BATTELLE: Well, my focus is on the Backstoppers and having resources to take care of police fire, and these officers are killed in the line of duty. But certainly, it's a dangerous era out there. Where it's going to end up, I don't know. It's very dangerous. You've got to give credit to these first responders. They put their life on the line every day, they are brave, they have a lot of courage, and Officer Bohannon performed with honor and courage here, and we lost him. MACCALLUM: He certainly did. And Backstoppers is a wonderful organization that supports these families, I encourage everybody to check it out, donate if you can. Beautiful, beautiful family -- BATTELLE: Absolutely. MACCALLUM: -- now trying to find their way forward without their dad and husband. Thank you very much, Chief Battelle. Good to have you here tonight. BATTELLE: Yes. And Backstoppers will be working with this. MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, sir. Coming up, World War II veteran Jack Holder, a survivor of Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway, and Guadalcanal, was supposed to be in Hawaii to celebrate the victory over Japan Day, but COVID-19 had other plans. His brave story, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: We have been remembering the 75th anniversary since the Japanese boarded the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay and signed the surrender documents, ending World War II, and beginning a great period of peace in American history. Dozens of World War II veterans were set to be in Pearl Harbor to commemorate this huge event, and they will now have to remain home due to COVID concerns. That includes my next guest, 98-year-old Pearl Harbor and Battle of Midway survivor Jack Holder, who wrote to the commemoration committee saying this. Many remaining vets like me traverse our nation from New York to Pearl Harbor to meet with young people, telling our stories, promoting the importance of resilience and optimism, courage and commitment in the face of challenge and loss. We want our message and experience about the challenges we faced back then to help remind everyone today that an adversary like COVID-19 will ultimately be no match for our spirit to fight and win. Jack Holder joins me now. Sir, thank you so much for all of your service to the country and for joining me today, it's great to speak with you. JACK HOLDER, 98-YEAR-OLD PEARL HARBOR SURVIVOR: Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, tell me a little bit -- you were in some of the most major moments of World War II, at Pearl Harbor, at Midway, at Guadalcanal, give us a sense of what your military role was when you were at Midway. HOLDER: Well, I had been in Pearl Harbor six days short of one year prior to December the 7th. I had a duty that day, which means you stay aboard and stand watch. And when I fill in for our master, I heard a terrible explosion, we run outside. And seen the first bomb that fell on Pearl Harbor. Several of our aircraft were on fire. We've seen aircraft in the sky with the rising sun and say, you know, we knew immediately what had happened. And so many people have asked me what my thoughts were at that time, and I guess the thoughts were so many and it's hard to relate, but surprise, anger, everything else, but I've seen the devastation that I'll never forget, Martha. MACCALLUM: Yes HOLDER: I looked down the battleship row and seen the Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Tennessee, California, Utah, and the Oklahoma. I've seen the Oklahoma turned turtle up. I've seen a gentleman sliding from the ship with burning oil and water. Some of them died in the water, some of them died on (Inaudible), and some of them died on the beach. I've been (Inaudible) machine gun feet, along my shipmates for three days and nights, and on the fourth day, we were allowed to return to our barracks. All of the lockers had been broken open to retrieve white clothing for bandages, and at that time, we were each given a postcard with two inscriptions. The first said - excuse me -- I've been wounded, and the second said I'm OK, don't worry. And believe it or not, my mother received this card 11 days later. Everything turned back to normal after that, we've been to (Inaudible) over all around Hawaii and the surrounding islands. I was in the second aircraft to spot the Japanese fleet coming to Midway, and I actually (Inaudible) recorded the report. August 3 or July the 2nd, I was in Guadalcanal from 48 over Guadalcanal and the Solomon Islands. In early 1943, I received orders to travel to San Diego, supposedly to help commission a new (Inaudible) and return to the South Pacific. When I reached San Diego, my orders had been changed. I started training in the beach (Inaudible) liberators. MACCALLUM: And you went to Europe. Your story is so remarkable. And I encourage people to go to your web site and learn more about it. But before I let you go, Mr. Holder, I just want to ask you about your -- you had expected to be at Pearl Harbor, and then they sort of turn that off, in terms of everybody coming there. Were you concerned about going there, or did you want to go? HOLDER: Well, I desperately wanted to go. I had thoughts about it, you know, but I was willing to forego all those stuff because I wanted that trip. MACCALLUM: Well, Jack Holder, we are so grateful to you for being here and your message to young people and how much you have worked your whole life to keep these stories alive and to remember the men who were lost. You are a living testament to the history of World War II, having been in some of the most monumental battles of that war. And we are grateful to you for your time and for your service tonight, and we will think of you as we remember this 75th anniversary. Thank you so much, sir. HOLDER: Well, thank you, Martha. I certainly appreciate the conversation with you. Thank you again for the invitation to be with you. Thank you. MACCALLUM: Thank you very much. Jack Holder. All the best. A real hero, that man. Amazing. You can read more about World War II heroes like Jack Holder in my best-selling book \"Unknown Valor: Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima.\" That is \u201cThe Story\u201d of September 1st, 2020. But as always, The story continues. So, we'll be back here tomorrow night for a special celebration of victory over Japan Day tomorrow. Have a good night.

            "article_content": "Reaction from Fox News contributor Tom Homan, former acting ICE director. When filmmaker Namrata Singh Gujral set off to make\u00a0the documentary, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Forgotten,\u201d in the early summer of 2019, she thought she would be bringing to life a remarkably different film pertaining to the trials and tribulations of those trying to unlawfully cross the U.S. border. \u201cI started reading stories of tragedy, of families trying to cross the Rio Grande, and it really resonated with me. I wanted to show their persecution. I bled and bought the narrative that the media and my party, the Democrats, had sold me,\u201d Gujral told Fox News. \u201cBut then when I started making this, the things I found were eye-opening. I realized the narrative I had been sold and supported was not the real truth. Illegal immigration is a terrible practice that should not only be discouraged, but it should be stopped.\u201d Mother who lost her son, Dominic, to an illegal immigrant (America's Forgotten) Gujral\u00a0said it has shaken her political loyalties and caused her to question everything she once thought she knew about the southern border. For months, the entertainment industry veteran journeyed the globe to explore how other countries grapple with the dangers of illegal\u00a0immigration. She also purveyed her own border state of California, seeking out stories of individuals struggling with the ripple effects of unauthorized crossers \u2013 in particular, parents who lost their children by the actions of illegal immigrants. Our first son Drew was 25 years old and going to law school in San Francisco when we got a call one night that there had been a terrible accident,\u201d Don Rosenberg, says in the film of his son who was killed by an illegal immigrant. \u201cWhen we arrived in San Francisco, they told us that our son had been killed in a traffic collision. The man who hit him was in the country illegally and never made an attempt to stop.\" Then there is the raw interview with parents who lost their son \u2013 a 911 dispatcher in the process of becoming a police officer \u2013 who was slain by an illegal immigrant while riding his motorcycle to work. The mother, who wears her child\u2019s ashes around her neck, remembers how the at-fault driver refused to apologize in court and was released from prison after just 35 days \u2013 while the family is left to endure a life sentence. NINTH CIRCUIT COURT RULES TRUMP CAN\u2019T DIVERT MILITARY FUNDS FOR BORDER WALL \u201cAmerica\u2019s Forgotten\u201d also points to other trickle-down consequences of\u00a0illegal immigration. Woven throughout the narrative is the story of a homeless U.S. veteran of the Iraq War, who resides on the gray concrete slabs outside the manicured Veteran\u2019s Affairs property on the west side of Los Angeles. Battling the demons of addiction and post-traumatic stress, he claims he could not get a construction job because of his lack of Spanish speaking skills. However, on the \"other\" side of the almost 2000-mile jagged border, Gujral said she interviewed more than 150 different people purporting to step foot on U.S. soil: the injured, the poor, the vulnerable. However, the reasons for fleeing their homes \u2013 she said \u2013 were very rarely on the basis of seeking asylum. \u201cI would say that at least 95 percent I spoke to had no asylum basis to come here other than to seek a better life,\u201d she surmised. \u201cRemember, that is not to be confused with refugees and those fleeing war zones who have little choice.\u201d Migrants get a free ride from a trucker toward the Guatemalan border after leaving San Pedro Sula, Honduras. (AP) Gujral recalled meeting one family who had three motorhomes in Central America and well-stuffed bank accounts, stressing that was just one of many examples of those who had successfully played the system and had been living in Los Angeles for seven\u00a0years. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Forgotten\u201d draws on how unscrupulous \u201ccoyotes\u201d -- human smugglers that bring migrants across the U.S. border \u2013 pad their pockets with fat wads of cash from immigrants by using talking points and debate videos to urge more people to cross over under the ruse that they will receive free health care and food stamps. Nonetheless, it is a lure that, especially for women, can be an excruciating price to pay. \u201cAs many as one in three women are raped on their journey to the U.S., whether that is being part of a migrant caravan or on their own,\u201d Gujral conjectured. FILE - In this March 18, 2020, file photo, a Border Patrol agent walks along a border wall separating Tijuana, Mexico, from San Diego, in San Diego. Vice President Mike Pence in March directed the nation\u2019s top disease control agency to use its emergency powers to effectively seal the U.S. borders, overruling the agency\u2019s scientists who said there was no evidence the action would slow the coronavirus, according to two former health officials. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) Some are sold multiple times a day to different cartels or drug fiends, raped and assaulted, left by the wayside wounded and weeping. The director also pointed to a sense of \u201cmisplaced compassion\u201d \u2013 questioning why not enough people point fingers at parents who risk the lives of their young children, knowing full well they don\u2019t have a certifiable need for asylum. GUNMEN IN MEXICO AMBUSH SECURITY FORCES, KILL 6 POLICE OFFICERS However, the number of migrants making scot-free onto U.S. soil via the southern border has significantly fallen in recent times. While spring has notoriously been a high-time for an immigration influx, the Trump administration this year touted all-time low numbers for the first portion of 2020. The number of border apprehensions did start to spike again through the summer, but numbers remained far behind the pinnacle of the 2019 migration crisis, potentially as a result of the economic slump brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the administration\u00a0issued an order\u00a0that empowered American immigration agents to halt standard processes and abruptly deport illicit border crossers, citing public health concerns. According to government figures, more than 90% of the arrests that happened in July resulted in a rapid return to\u00a0Mexico, where asylum seekers are mandated to wait to have their case reviewed. \u201cCrossings, illegal and legal, are down since the beginning of the pandemic. Government data in the spring indicated that illegal crossings were down as much as 50 percent,\" according to\u00a0DW Gibson, journalist and author of\u00a0 14 Miles: Building the Border Wall.\u201d Gibson stated\u00a0that the Trump administration stepped up border closures \"was an effort to stop the spread of the disease\" and now those closures have \"been extended to October 21.\" The pandemic, added\u00a0Gibson, has changed migratory patterns, noting they \"are down across the globe as people wrestle with fighting off sickness and death in their home communities. Legal crossings are way down as the federal government has put in place various travel restrictions at various times and also severely restricted access to visas.\u201d And while the deeply decisive issue of immigration was front and center in the\u00a0Presidential election\u00a0cycle four years ago, it has receded from the 2020 headlines \u2013 although the two candidates bestow dramatically different views on the matter. \u201cThe issue of immigration has been pushed aside like so many essential because of the Covid pandemic,\u201d Gibson explained. \u201cAs long as the nation is gripped by a deadly pandemic, it\u2019ll make it hard to get to all of the other pressing issues.\u201d Should Biden be triumphant at the ballot box, he has vowed to swiftly undo and re-shape the Trump team\u2019s hardline stance. As per the Biden campaign website, the Democratic hopeful lashed out at the reigning president\u2019s \u201cmisguided policies,\u201d and promised to \u201cimmediately reverse the Trump Administration\u2019s cruel and senseless policies that separate parents from their children at our border,\u201d \u201csurge humanitarian resources to the border,\u201d as well as \u201cend prolonged detention.\u201d An Honduran migrant and her daughter sit at a roadblock set by security forces in Poptun, Guatemala, Friday, Oct. 2, 2020.

(AP Photo/Moises Castillo) In contrast, Trump\u2019s reelection to a second term would enable a continued clampdown on illicit immigrants and sustain the push to deter those from trying through an array of stringent policies \u2013 some of which have stalled in federal courts \u2013 and continue construction of the storied \u201cborder wall,\u201d of which more than 300 miles have already been erected or repaired, according to the Customs and Border Patrol. While analysts have pointed out that Trump has also sharply curtailed much legal immigration to the United States too \u2013 of which he often positions as putting the interests of Americans first \u2013 his administration also endeavored at the Republican National Convention that it stands behind lawful means of coming to the country, escaping government persecution, and becoming U.S. citizens. Yet given the sensitivity and fraught emotion that often encircles the issue of immigration, especially in the typically left-leaning enclave of Hollywood, Gujral is bracing for a backlash as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Forgotten\u201d becomes\u00a0available for streaming\u00a0on Friday.

            "article_content": "Aimee Buccellato, a friend of Amy Coney Barrett, reacts to the judge\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Thursday to confirm President Trump\u2019s nomination of 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, followed by a full Senate vote expected Monday. At Judge Barrett\u2019s Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing we learned a great deal about her approach to the law, but even more about how willing Senate Democrats are to sacrifice the foundations of the republic on the altar of big government. We watched and listened as the Democrats used their time at the hearing to rail about COVID-19 spending bills and their terror of a world without the Affordable Care Act. Never mind that two weeks ago every one of them chose to vote against much-needed legislation that would have provided relief to individuals, businesses, and schools impacted by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 along with funding for vaccines and testing. They don\u2019t want a solution; they want a campaign issue. JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN LINDSEY GRAHAM BRUSHES OFF REPORTS COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS MAY BOYCOTT ACB VOTE Over the course of four days, the liberal wing of the Judiciary Committee threw all the mud they had against the hearing room walls, taking full advantage of the chaotic news cycle in a last-ditch effort to portray Judge Barrett as a corrupt tool of the Trump administration. At every turn, they conflated the issue at hand \u2014 which was, believe it or not, the examination of Barrett\u2019s prodigious record \u2014 with a panicked defense of their own disastrous policies. Throughout the whole disgusting performance \u2014 the fake emotion, the condescending displays of disapproval, the blatant suggestions that Judge Barrett was far too simpleminded to deserve her appointment \u2014 Barrett sat quietly, composed. Democrats did not ruffle or anger her. She kept control of the debate, and quickly made it clear that underestimating her abilities was a terrible mistake. What the left obviously does not appreciate is that women on the political right are on to them. We live with the bias and prejudice thrown at us every day by the left and the liberal media. If you want to meet someone who is rock-solid in her conservative principles, take some initiative and meet a conservative woman. This is the reason I wrote my book, \u201cThe Mind of a Conservative Woman.\u201d We have come to expect that our pro-life, family, religion, business, and military views have painted a target on our backs, welcoming accusations from the left that we are somehow not fully female. For years, liberals in Washington have relied on the courts to massage constitutionally suspect legislation into something resembling respectable policy. So it\u2019s no surprise that Judiciary Committee Democrats squandered the vast majority of their time trying to trick and manipulate Judge Barrett into guaranteeing she would use her vote to rubber stamp a party platform \u2014 a tactic that failed them miserably. Undeterred, they threw down their pens and ridiculous charts and declared that if /Judge Barrett couldn\u2019t guarantee progressive outcomes, she had no choice but to recuse herself from any number of a vaguely defined set of cases. Of course, Judge Barrett could no more guarantee the safety and prosperity of blue state constituents than she could a world free from abortion and socialized health care. Everyone in the room knew this. Sensing their own unraveling, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s left wing turned the dais into a stump and launched a mind-numbing volley of accusations of rank corruption, backroom deals and outright conspiracy. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Here\u2019s the important distinction between the two sides of that dais: while one Democratic senator stated that he feared Barrett would usher in an era of conservative activism, he accidentally revealed that what Democrats want is an era of liberal activism. The Democrats, in their zeal to \u201cpack the court,\u201d or at least \u201cbalance\u201d it \u2014 as they kept insisting was key to delivering justice \u2014 are looking for activists who will do the party\u2019s bidding. That\u2019s what they expect. Conservatives, on the other hand want constitutionalists who will call balls and strikes. If a law needs changing, that\u2019s our job in Congress, not the business of the judiciary. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This is our commitment to the American people: that no election, high-stakes appointment, or policy battle will cut the mooring lines that keep us grounded in the Constitution and the founding freedoms that make America so special. I understand how important that connection is, as do millions of conservative women and, most crucially, as does Judge Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 and that\u2019s why this conservative woman will be more than happy to stand on her behalf and support her confirmation on the Senate floor when the time comes.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0 Sign up here. EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0Thirty-seven Planned Parenthood affiliates applied for and received a total of $80 million in loans\u00a0from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" has learned -- and now the federal government wants the money back, saying the affiliates should have known they weren't eligible for the coronavirus stimulus payouts. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is reaching out to each involved\u00a0Planned Parenthood affiliate explaining that affiliates of larger organizations with more than 500 employees aren't eligible for PPP distributions, Fox News is told. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PFFA) alone has had more than 600\u00a0employees. A Planned Parenthood affiliate in Metropolitan Washington (PPMW), for example, will receive a letter stating that although self-certified that it was eligible for a $1,328,000 PPP loan in accordance with the SBA's affiliation rules, it will need to return the money. PPMW's request for money from the Trump administration came just\u00a0months after the affiliate's president and CEO, Laura Meyers, promised to turn down federal funds. \"Planned Parenthood is never going to allow the Trump-Pence administration to bully us into withholding critical health information from our patients,\" Meyers said last August, after the White House banned Planned Parenthood clinics from making abortion referrals if they wanted to continue receiving federal funds. At the time, Planned Parenthood vowed to give up federal funds entirely, rather than comply with the order. HHS REVEALS WHERE\u00a0TITLE X $$ GOING AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD ABANDONS GRANTS Pro-life activists outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File) The SBA warned more \"severe penalties\" were possible, beyond mandatory repayment. In particular, incorrect\u00a0or false eligibility\u00a0certifications by PPP recipients could result in criminal or civil sanctions if the SBA determined borrowers made knowingly false statements, the SBA letter read. The letter\u00a0explained that PPFA affiliates clearly were covered by the PPP affiliate rules. \"PPFA's bylaws, a version of which is publicly available, reveal that becoming a PPFA affiliate requires a certification by the PPFA board,\" the document continued. \"Once certified, \"[e]ach Affiliate shall be governed by written bylaws, which conform to PPFA policies.\" The largest\u00a0single government loan was a $7.5 million allotment to the Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California. One Planned Parenthood affiliate received a loan but declined it. After this report was published, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called for an investigation and said the money needed to be returned, warning that criminal prosecution may be appropriate.\u00a0Rick Scott, R-Fla., and James Lankford, R-Okla., also demanded Planned Parenthood return the funds. Rubio, who has served as\u00a0chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said Planned Parenthood's violation of PPP rules was \"clear.\" \u201cThere is no ambiguity in the legislation that passed or public record around its passage that organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whose parent organization has close to half a billion dollars in assets, is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program,\u201d Rubio said.\u00a0\u201cThose funds must be returned immediately. Furthermore, the SBA should open an investigation into how these loans were made in clear violation of the applicable affiliation rules and if Planned Parenthood, the banks, or staff at the SBA knowingly violated the law, all appropriate legal options should be pursued.\u201d Later Tuesday evening, Hawley tweeted: \"The money needs to be recovered and if anybody knowingly falsified applications, they need to be prosecuted.\" Added Scott:\u00a0\"Yet another example of the #PPP program being misused. Florida\u2019s taxpayers should not be footing to bail out a huge organization like Planned Parenthood. This money should be returned immediately.\" Lankford, meanwhile, wrote that \"every dollar Planned Parenthood took from PPP was a dollar that did not get to legitimate small businesses.\" \"With an annual budget of over one billion dollars and the explicit Small Business Administration affiliation rules made it clear that Planned Parenthood was not and is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program,\" Lankford wrote. \"Like other large organizations that returned monies they were not eligible for, Planned Parenthood should immediately repay the American people the money they took from deserving small businesses and non-profits.\" The Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life nonprofit, separately highlighted Planned Parenthood's role as an abortion provider. COULD ROE V. WADE BE OVERTURNED? \u201cAcross the country, Planned Parenthood refused to cease its abortion operation in wake of the pandemic, hoarding personal protective equipment and putting its staff and women at risk,\" a spokesperson for the SBA List told Fox News. \"It is rich that they, in turn, feel entitled to taxpayer dollars meant to help businesses in need,\" the spokesperson continued.\u00a0\"After decades of feeding at the taxpayer\u2019s trough while running the nation\u2019s largest abortion operation, they have over a billion dollars in net assets. They should return this funding immediately. We thank President Trump for his strong commitment to stop taxpayer funding of abortion and abortionists like Planned Parenthood.\u201d This past January,\u00a0Planned Parenthood reported a record-high number of abortions\u00a0and government funding.\u00a0Planned Parenthood affiliates claimed to have performed 345,672 abortions from Oct. 1, 2017\u00a0to Sept. 30, 2018. The 46th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., in January 2019. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg via Getty Images, File) At the same time, Planned Parenthood claimed abortion constituted just a small percentage \u2013\u00a04\u00a0percent in 2018-2019 \u2013\u00a0of its services, and that federal funds didn't go directly to abortions. Some 98 percent\u00a0of PPP loans have been less than $1 million; the program has\u00a0provided\u00a0an average loan of\u00a0$118,000. Canceled or returned funds can be used during future PPP rounds. Republicans have strongly resisted reported efforts from some Democrats to push abortion-related spending amid the pandemic. In March, The Daily Caller reported House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tried to include federal funding for abortion in the coronavirus stimulus bill. Multiple senior White House officials told the outlet that\u00a0speaking to\u00a0Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi sought a provision for up to\u00a0$1 billion to \"reimburse laboratory claims.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That might set a precedent for health-related spending without the protections of the Hyde Amendment, a compromise restricting federal funds for abortion in most cases. \"A new mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented,\" a White House official said. \"Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion \u2014 which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms.\"",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) \u2014 Former President George W. Bush on Friday backed Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in his first public endorsement of\u00a0the 2020 election cycle. Bush has largely stayed out of the political fray since he left the White House in 2009, and his endorsement is a welcome boost for Collins, who is waging her most difficult campaign yet as she seeks a fifth term. The centrist senator has become a top target for Democrats, who cast her as an enabler of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, even though she said she votes against him more than any other GOP senator and\u00a0distances herself\u00a0from his more controversial statements and policies. \u201cShe's honest. She's forthright. She brings dignity into a world that has gotten really ugly. The political world is uglier than I can ever remember it,\u201d Bush said after he and his wife, Laura, had lunch with Collins at the family's summer home overlooking the ocean. Bush called her \u201csmart and capable,\" \"very influential\" and \"pretty darned independent.\" SEN. COLLINS REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR TRUMP, SIGNALS SHE WON'T CAMPAIGN AGAINST BIDEN Laura Bush said she has been \u201cshocked\u201d by attack ads targeting Collins. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way the ads are portraying her because I know they\u2019re not correct, and I also just don't like that kind of campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it gave me really an extra reason to stand up and speak for Susan Collins.\u201d Collins said she was happy \u201con a personal level\u201d for the backing. \u201cI have great admiration for President Bush and Laura Bush. To have their support means the world to me,\u201d she said afterward. National attention on the race has helped Collins' opponent, Democrat Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, amass a sizable cash advantage. The nod from the former president, whose politics appear centrist by Trump-era standards, may nudge some traditional Republicans into Collins\u2019 corner. Trump has not endorsed the Maine senator, whose race is among a handful critical to Republicans' hopes of keeping control of the Senate, where they have a 53-47 advantage. Collins, meanwhile, has not said whether she intends to vote for Trump. The endorsement is a rare move for Bush. While he has done some private fundraisers for candidates since leaving office, this is his first show of public support for a candidate this year, his office said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Collins worked with Bush when he was president and served as the first chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Back then, Collins served alongside another Republican from Maine, Olympia Snowe, who has since retired from the Senate. Collins is now the only Republican member of Congress from New England. Collins has been popular in Maine, but Democrats were incensed when she voted for\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0for the Supreme Court and for\u00a0Trump's tax breaks. Democrats view unseating Collins this fall as a key to retaking control of the Senate, and Gideon drew early support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Gideon already has raised more than $24 million, compared with more than $16 million for Collins. That doesn't include $3.8 million for Gideon that was crowdsourced by critics of Collins during the Kavanaugh debate. Gideon also has picked up a number of endorsements from groups that previously backed Collins: the Human Rights Campaign and the Maine State Council of Machinists, for example. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which was neutral in Collins' 2014 race, is backing Gideon. Bush\u2019s family has long had a compound in Kennebunkport, where his father, former President George H.W. Bush, spent much of the year in a stone-and-shingle house until his death in 2018. George and Laura Bush now reside in the main house. This is their second time spending the summer there, Laura Bush said. \u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show that the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, not the Planned Parenthood Victory Fund, endorsed Gideon.",

            "article_content": "A look at the day's trending stories on FoxNews.com. Democrats say they want more \u201cinclusive\u201d voting practices. They fail to mention just how inclusive their plans are: sending ballots to dead voters. Nevada is a case study of the lengths Democrats will go to secure a voting edge. First Marc Elias and Perkins Coie\u00a0sued\u00a0the state on behalf of Democrat groups, demanding election officials break laws against ballot harvesting, ignore signature verification requirements and send ballots to inactive voters the state believes moved away. They demanded more in-person voting locations while arguing voting in person was too dangerous for the June 9 mail-in vote primary. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: CORONAVIRUS DEEPENS DIVISIONS\u00a0\u2014 EXCEPT MAYBE THIS ONE BIT OF COMMON GROUND The message was sent, and Democrats in Clark County got in line. A new voting plan was reached \u201cshrouded in mystery,\u201d according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Officials would now increase the number of in-person voting locations in the Democrat-heavy region, mail ballots to all \u201cvoters\u201d and allow \u201cfield registrars,\u201d commonly known as ballot harvesters, to pick them up. All at the expense of taxpayers of $323,000, and the rule of law. The result has made Clark County look more like Tammany Hall.\u00a0What is unfolding should concern every American. Weeks before the election, live ballots are piling up at apartment complexes. Others are found in the trash. The\u00a0Review-Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0one postal worker has already found thousands of ballots that are \u201cno good,\u201d just \u201csitting in crates with no additional safeguards.\u201d Jenny\u00a0Trobiani, who has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for over three decades, said the ballots were for residents who \u201chad all moved or died.\u201d She even received one in the mail for her deceased mother. Dozens of ballots are being found pinned to community bulletin boards. \u201cFrom Friday to Monday, I could have voted 20 times,\u201d said one resident of an apartment complex in Las Vegas. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so concerning about all this.\u201d Who is to stop a Democrat \u201cfield registrar\u201d from picking them up, signing them and dropping them off? That sounds outrageous. But it is what Democrat groups are seeking in their lawsuit. Trained poll officials would no longer be able to throw out fraudulent ballots that do not match their signature on file. Instead, the lawsuit would prohibit what it calls the \u201cdubious art of signature matching\u201d and circumvent Nevada\u2019s ballot harvesting ban. Signature matching is so \u201cdubious\u201d it has been required for every new voter registration in Nevada and used to verify every voter who shows up at the polls\u00a0for years. This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons. Democrats are welcoming voter fraud in Nevada. And they are not even hiding it. The Elias\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0is explicit. It states the statewide ban on ballot harvesting \u201chamstrings\u201d the ability of Democrat groups, including the Democratic National Committee, the Nevada State Democratic Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Priorities USA, to \u201cassist voters in making the transition to vote by mail.\u201d Democrats are happy to \u201cassist,\u201d\u00a0as long as\u00a0you vote Democrat. This is not unique to Nevada. Democrats are attacking the integrity of our elections across the country and circling the wagons. From\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0to the\u00a0Center for American Progress, left-wing\u00a0activist groups are pushing the same false talking points that while we flatten the curve we must upend our elections. Voting must be more \u201cinclusive\u201d (by adopting liberal policies). Nancy Pelosi\u2019s $3 trillion bill would launch a federal takeover of our elections, all in line with Elias\u2019 lawsuits in 29 states. Their mission is to nationalize ballot harvesting, gut signature verification and voter ID laws and send millions of ballots to voters who have died or moved away, before November.

There are over\u00a0200,000\u00a0inactive voters in Clark County alone. Inactive voters are given the opportunity to update their registrations and can still request a ballot in the upcoming election. Individuals are only deemed inactive after the state receives evidence from the Postal Service that they have moved. \u201cKnowingly mailing a ballot to a wrong address is bad enough,\u201d a\u00a0Review-Journal\u00a0editorial recently\u00a0argued. \u201cCombining that with the elimination of signature verification is an open invitation to shenanigans and makes absolutely no sense.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That\u2019s why this week I sent a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford requesting an investigation into Clark County\u2019s backroom deal, and potential violations of state election and\u00a0open meeting\u00a0laws. Democrat officials in Clark County did not allow any public input before unilaterally upending its election procedures. Our elections must be free, fair and secure.

            "article_content": "Reaction from California RNC committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon. Newly obtained testimony from Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) officials has raised questions about the organization\u2019s initial response to journalist David Daleiden\u2019s undercover videos, and refocused attention on whether the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider violated federal law regarding fetal tissue donations. PPFA previously accused Daleiden of \u201cheavily\u201d editing his footage, which showed high-ranking officials discussing how they performed abortions in order to provide suitable fetal tissue to procurement companies like StemExpress. Daleiden argues, however, that sworn depositions from his civil case confirm what\u2019s been seen as the more troubling aspects of his videos. Fox News has obtained footage of officials\u2019 testimonies, in addition to a video Daleiden is releasing Tuesday in an attempt to discredit PPFA\u2019s initial narrative. Perhaps most controversial were Daleiden\u2019s first undercover videos, which showed Drs. Deborah Nucatola and Mary Gatter \u2013\u00a0both senior management at PPFA \u2013\u00a0discussing how they perform abortions differently, or use a \u201cless crunchy\u201d technique, when a patient has elected to donate fetal tissue. 27 GOP SENATORS ASK AG BARR TO INVESTIGATE PLANNED PARENTHOOD GETTING PPP FUNDS Both doctors confirmed, in testimony obtained by Fox News, that they altered abortions but maintained that their \u201cprocedure\u201d never changed. Nucatola, for example, was asked about her previous comment regarding crushing a fetus above and below its thorax to obtain intact tissue. \u201cYou would do that as a general matter?\u201d one of Daleiden\u2019s attorneys asked. \u201cIf I was aware that it was a donation case, yes.\u201d She added that doing so was \u201cnot a change in the procedure.\u201d Gatter specifically testified that she would alter\u00a0her \u201ctechniques.\u201d While discussing her \u201cevolution\u201d in thinking on the issue, Gatter said: \u201cBy the time I was at PP [Planned Parenthood] Pasadena, many of us were moving in the direction of making this distinction between method and procedure, method and technique. And so I was very comfortable at that time that the difference in technique did not \u2013\u00a0doing different techniques:\u00a0manual aspiration versus electronic aspiration \u2013\u00a0did not really affect the procedure or the method; so it was, therefore, permissible in terms of fetal tissue donation.\u201d Catherine Glenn Foster, an attorney who leads Americans United for Life, told Fox News that PPFA's distinction \"doesn't matter legally. They are changing the procedure in order to sell ... the bodies of abortion victims.\" Dr. Forrest Smith, an OBGYN who\u2019s performed thousands of abortions, told Fox News that the \u201ctechniques\u201d phrasing was just one of several \u201csemantic sleight-of-hand trick[s]\u201d PPFA has employed to shoehorn compliance with federal law \u2014\u00a0which prohibits the \u201calteration of the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate a pregnancy.\u201d One of those \u201ctricks,\u201d he said, included PPFA\u2019s decision to add \u201csubstantively\u201d as a modifier to \u201caltering\u201d in its policies \u2014\u00a0phrasing that Cecile Richards, then-PPFA president, used in a 2015 letter to congressional leaders. UNSEALED DOCS SHOW PLANNED PARENTHOOD CHARGED $25G FOR BODY PARTS, BLOOD SAMPLES WITHIN MONTHS Gatter\u2019s and Nucatola\u2019s testimonies, the video suggests, are important to understanding PPFA\u2019s efforts to ensure affiliates comply with federal law. Under oath, Nucatola said\u00a0she didn\u2019t follow up with Gatter\u2019s affiliate after PPFA reissued a 10-year-old guidance on the matter. Gatter, who served as medical director for the Los Angeles affiliate, famously joked on-camera that she wanted a Lamborghini while negotiating rates for fetal tissue. PPFA did not specifically respond to Fox News\u2019 question about the techniques versus procedure distinction. However, it emphatically denied any illegal activity while attempting to discredit Daleiden. \u201cThese claims are baseless, and coming from a group that\u2019s been discredited time and time again,\u201d Erica Sackin, the senior director of communications and culture at PPFA, told Fox News on Monday. She added: \u201cThe truth is that the Center for Medical Progress broke the law to try and prevent Planned Parenthood from serving the patients who depend on us, and to shut down a provider of critical sexual and reproductive health care, including cancer screenings, STI testing, birth control\u00a0and abortion care. They still face criminal charges, and were ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages\u00a0as a result.\u201d The group has similarly pointed out that Nucatola said\u00a0on camera that she isn\u2019t interested in profiting off tissue and that Gatter also said,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not in it for the money.\u201d Daleiden has been successfully sued by PPFA \u2013\u00a0earning them $2 million in damages \u2013\u00a0and is currently undergoing a related criminal prosecution that he and his lawyers describe as a gross abuse of power. UNDERCOVER JOURNALIST SUING KAMALA HARRIS FOR CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE HIS CIVIL RIGHTS THROUGH PROSECUTION Daleiden asserts that his work is protected speech and that PPFA is using bogus talking points to hide what he says is clear evidence of malfeasance. In her letter to Congress, Richards argued that the key to federal compliance was ensuring changes to abortions don\u2019t \u201cimpact the safety or well-being of the patient.\u201d But according to Daleiden, PPFA\u2019s medical alterations essentially turn the tissue itself into a commodity that can be marketed in the way federal law expressly prohibits. The issue received renewed attention\u00a0earlier this year,\u00a0when media outlets reported on unsealed invoices showing a per diem fee for each product of conception (POC), a medical term for fetal body parts. Three invoices from 2012 showed a PP affiliate charging $24,940, along with more than 200 POC's to StemExpress, a tissue procurement company. Planned Parenthood has defended itself by claiming that the charges are related to transportation and time spent by staff. The invoices don't mention either of those, however, nor do they contain the word \"reimbursement.\" Instead, they assign a fee per body part. Specifically, the previously released contract between those organizations showed that the exchanges were based on \"POC determined in the clinic to be usable\u201d \u2014\u00a0a key distinction in Daleiden\u2019s argument that PPFA is commodifying human remains. \"The federal law against selling aborted fetal organs and tissues in exchange for 'valuable consideration' was enacted to prevent monetary incentives to turn children in the womb into a commodity,\u201d Daleiden previously told Fox News. \u201cThe law lays out the unmistakable difference between a researcher reimbursing a clinic for used up PPE, versus StemExpress paying solely for the number of 'usable' body parts it could collect and then sell from Planned Parenthood's abortions.\u201d 'JANE ROE' IN ROE V. WADE SUPREME COURT CASE SAYS SHE WAS PAID TO SUPPORT PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT StemExpress, which promises \"financial profits\" in its\u00a0brochure, handled all of the services for which Planned Parenthood might legitimately seek reimbursement under the law, Daleiden has also argued. He pointed to a House Select Panel report suggesting that Planned Parenthood was engaging in \"double counting\" costs like transportation. Instead, it indicated that the group's costs were \"more properly assigned to the middleman procurer or the end user researcher.\" In Daleiden\u2019s latest video, officials offer sworn testimony confirming the contents of internal communications that he says suggest a financial interest in providing fetal tissue specimens. For example, one email shows Tram Nguyen, an administrator at PPFA Gulf Coast, saying she wants to \u201cmove forward\u201d with an offer from Daleiden\u2019s fake company, Biomax, which included high-dollar compensation for fetal tissue ($700 for fetal liver and $1,600 for a liver, thymus pair). Besides indicating a financial interest, Nguyen\u2019s testimony, Daleiden alleges, also contradicts Planned Parenthood\u2019s previous claim that it declined Biomax\u2019s offer. Daleiden told Fox News he never heard back from PPFA, and the abortion provider declined to comment further when contacted by Fox News. PAVLICH DECRIES PLANNED PARENTHOOD CORONAVIRUS AID: 'THEY GET $500 MILLION-PLUS FROM TAXPAYERS EVERY YEAR' Daleiden\u2019s video also highlights an email in which Dr. Dorothy Fergerson, the chief medical officer for PPFA\u2019s largest affiliate, purportedly says she\u2019s switching procurement companies after hearing that StemExpress would collect samples more frequently than their current provider. In reference to StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer, the unnamed employee tells Fergerson: \u201cHer business is starting to take off which is good for her and us as well.\u201d When asked under oath about whether the switch was based on frequency of pick-up, Fergerson indicated it was. \u201cI think that that\u2019s true that it seemed that StemExpress was working with more researchers perhaps than ABR [Advanced Bioscience Resources] was.\u201d Fergerson also confirmed that her affiliate wouldn\u2019t receive a reimbursement from StemExpress if its tissue sample wasn\u2019t determined to be \u201cusable.\u201d PPFA has denied \"selling\" fetal tissue and it's unclear how the group planned for revenue from those transfers.\u00a0Daleiden's video shows ABR's founder, Linda Tracy,\u00a0repeatedly being directed\u00a0by her attorney not to answer questions regarding potential conversations about PPFA's revenue projections. Daleiden's latest video came at a critical time when Planned Parenthood faced a potential investigation over its misuse of coronavirus relief funds. While the Department of Justice\u00a0already opened a probe into its fetal tissue practices, it's unclear how it progressed since 2017 when it first made headlines. The DOJ did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., alleging that as her state's attorney general, she conspired to violate his civil rights through a purportedly bogus prosecution. Daleiden, an anti-abortion activist,\u00a0famously released undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials engaging in highly controversial discussions about fetal tissue procurement. In response, California sued him through an unprecedented application of the state's eavesdropping law -- a move that Daleiden alleges was intended to suppress journalism. \u201cThis complaint seeks justice for a brazen, unprecedented, and ongoing conspiracy to selectively use California\u2019s video recording laws as a political weapon to silence disfavored speech,\" reads Wednesday's lawsuit, brought by both Daleiden and his Center for Medical Progress.\u00a0The suit also names Xavier Becerra, the state's current attorney general, in addition to Harris. \"David Daleiden became the first journalist ever to be criminally prosecuted under California\u2019s recording law, not because of the method of video recording he utilized in his investigation\u2014which is common in investigative journalism in this state\u2014but because his investigation revealed and he published 'shock[ing]' content that California\u2019s Attorney General and the private party co-conspirators wanted to cover up,\u201d it says.

Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos issued a directive in late July that Vermont in 2020 will hold a universal mail-in election, meaning that all\u00a0active voters will be sent mail-in ballots without needing to request them. This was done after the state legislature in June passed a law permitting universal mail-in balloting. \"Voting by mail is simple, safe\u00a0and secure,\" Condos said at the time. \"Planning for the 2020 elections, as we collectively respond to the COVID-19 health crisis, has meant accepting that for some of us, the elections process may look or feel a little different this year.\" WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABSENTEE VOTING AND UNIVERSAL VOTE-BY-MAIL? According to the directive, ballots were mailed to voters between Sept. 21 and Oct. 1. It recommends that voters mail their ballots no later than Oct. 24 to ensure that they are counted. Vermont will only count ballots received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. There are also in-person voting options. There are drop boxes for mail ballots set up around the state, and the deadline to vote there is 7 p.m. on Election Day. Voters wishing to vote in person are told to bring their mail ballot with them, but if they do not they can still sign an affidavit saying they have not already voted to cast an in-person ballot. If voters receive a ballot for a person who is dead or has moved they are told to contact their town so it can update the voter rolls.

            "article_content": "Pelosi unveils $3 trillion relief bill; Chad Pergram reports. House Democrats' latest\u00a0coronavirus relief proposal unveiled Tuesday includes more than $3 trillion in new spending, amounting to\u00a0the biggest and most expensive aid package yet to deal with the global pandemic, Fox News has learned. Of the more than\u00a0$3 trillion package, about $1 trillion would go to state, local and tribal governments, according to three\u00a0sources briefed on the proposal. STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL Another round of $1,200 stimulus payments also would go out to most Americans under the plan, with a maximum of $6,000 per household. Then a flurry of aid\u00a0would be allocated to struggling Americans:\u00a0extending the $600 extra in weekly unemployment insurance through January, pausing student loan payments through September and creating a new $175 billion benefit that would subsidize rent and mortgage payments for Americans. House Democrats called the legislation the HEROES Act. The text\u00a0of\u00a0the sprawling plan was circulated Tuesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the historic package\u00a0in a televised address from the Capitol Tuesday where she ticked off the grave statistics of the pandemic: more than 80,000 deaths in America and 33 million Americans losing\u00a0their jobs and filing for unemployment. \"We face the biggest catastrophe\u00a0in our nation's history,\" Pelosi said. \u201cThis is a moment when many millions of our fellow Americans are in deep suffering,\" Pelosi said. \"We\u00a0must have empathy for our heroes.\" Pelosi continued: \"We must also empathize with the pain of families who do not\u00a0know where their next meals are\u00a0coming from and how to pay next month's\u00a0rent.\" The plan calls for a new $200 billion Heroes' Fund to ensure essential workers who have put their health and safety on the line receive hazard pay during the pandemic. The legislation also directs the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00a0(OSHA) to create new worker safety standards for employers. But the price tag shows that Democrats have gone big -- rather, huge -- for the fifth round of coronavirus legislation. And it's a figure sure to face deep skepticism from cost-conscious lawmakers growing uncomfortable with the historic pace of massive spending legislation.\u00a0The U.S. Treasury already had to borrow $3 trillion to fund the first four coronavirus spending packages that passed with bipartisan support. Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's comfortable borrowing that much money because of historically low interest rates, some Republicans are now cool to more spending -- especially another $3 trillion worth. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately, but that time could develop, but I don't think it has yet,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday. House Republicans are deeply skeptical of the bill, in a sign Democrats may have to go it alone on this round of legislation -- and that it faces long odds in the GOP-led Senate. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., blasted Pelosi for drafting a \"liberal wish list\" while Congress is still on recess. \"Now she wants to write a $3 trillion bill, with no one able to see, no accountability, and no input,\" McCarthy told Fox News on Monday. \"I mean, this is not how democracy works. This is a real concern to all of us this won't ever become law, but it'll be the wishlist of the liberals, to try to change election law, fund Planned Parenthood, and make sure sanctuary cities get the chunk of the money.\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., alerted House members who have been away on recess to return to Washington Friday. The House is scheduled to vote on\u00a0the massive coronavirus legislation and a\u00a0proposal to allow lawmakers to work remotely. House leadership didn't involve the White House or Senate Republicans in drafting this legislation which signals the bill isn't going far. Liberal Democrats were upset that the earlier four relief bills didn't go far enough on direct payments, housing help,\u00a0immigrant inclusion and more. This plan seeks to ease some liberal concerns in the caucus and serve as an opening marker for potential negotiations with Republicans. House leadership argues the legislation needed to be \"big\" to meet\u00a0the needs of the American people reeling from\u00a0forced economic shutdowns and widespread illness and death. \"This is an unprecedented time in our history,\" Hoyer said. \"...And as a result, we need to respond in unprecedented ways with unprecedented resources.\" The centerpiece of the legislation will be assistance for state, local and tribal governments to help plug budget holes from coronavirus crisis\u00a0spending and declining tax revenues. Democrats billed this as help for the \"heroes\" in the public service workforce, such as first responders, teachers and transportation workers, who are at risk for layoffs. In a nod to progressive demands, the legislation includes\u00a0rent and mortgage assistance and more direct payments, but falls short of\u00a0the demands they wanted, such\u00a0as $2,000 in monthly reoccurring payments. Federal student loan payments would also be suspended through Sept. 30, 2021, with no interest accrual during that time. House Democrats will provide $75 billion for testing and contact tracing\u00a0as well as support for hospitals and health care providers. The legislation will provide expanded food assistance to struggling families through a 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits. The legislation also funds mail-in voting, election assistance and $25 billion for the\u00a0U.S. Postal Service. The legislation extends the provisions in the forgivable loan program for small businesses known as the\u00a0Paycheck Protection Program from eight weeks to 24 weeks. There's no new money for the PPP program, but $10 billion more in emergency disaster grants for small businesses. PELOSI SAYS DEMOCRATS ARE THINKING 'BIG' FOR NEXT ROUND OF CORONAVIRUS AID, DESPITE DEBT CONCERNS FROM GOP Hoyer alerted the House\u00a0members, which have been away on recess, to return to Washington for votes on Friday on the fifth round of coronavirus legislation as well as a resolution to allow for proxy voting or virtual meetings \u2014\u00a0though Hoyer said no bipartisan agreement has been reached yet. The House Rules Committee will meet Thursday to prepare for the Friday floor debate on the coronavirus legislation and the proxy proposal. If the House passes this legislation it's poised to be the largest stimulus package ever. The previous record was held by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act that President Trump signed into law March 27 that included the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and the $1,200 in cash assistance for most Americans. Unlike the first four rounds of coronavirus relief, this bill is already proving to be more contentious with Republicans wanting to hit the brakes on spending. The White House wanted a payroll tax cut in any new legislation and Senate Republicans want protection for businesses from lawsuits. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But neither the tax cut nor liability protection\u00a0is\u00a0in the House bill. \"That is not our focus nor do we think that ought to be a priority,\" Hoyer said of the business liability protections. Republicans dismissed the $3 trillion bill as \"aspirational\" legislation with little chance of becoming law. The real cure for the economic woes will be reopening businesses and getting Americans back to work, they argue. The Democrats' bill is nothing more than a \"messaging exercise,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. But Pelosi said now is not the time to pause Congress's historic relief efforts. \"The families who are suffering, though,\u00a0their hunger doesn't take\u00a0a pause,\" Pelosi said. \"The rent doesn't take a pause. The bills don't take a pause.\" Fox News' Mike Emanuel, Chad Pergram, Andrew O'Reilly\u00a0Sally Parsons\u00a0 and Fox Business Network's R.N. White contributed to this report.",

Despite reports that Kanye West has suspended his much-gossiped about presidential bid, the rapper-producer\u2019s name will appear on the general election ballot in at least one state this November. The Oklahoma State Election Board tweeted Wednesday that West has qualified in the Sooner State to be on the ballot. Wednesday was the state\u2019s deadline for independent and\u00a0unrecognized party presidential candidates to file statements of candidacy with their petitions or filing fees. The state posted his statement of candidacy on its website and listed him as a candidate online.\u00a0Fox News also confirmed with a spokeswoman for the election board that West has qualified. \"This afternoon we received a properly executed statement of candidacy for Kanye West, along with the appropriate filing fee in lieu of petition,\"\u00a0Oklahoma State Election Board spokeswoman\u00a0Misha Mohr told Fox News.\u00a0\"Kanye West is now qualified as an independent candidate for President of the United States in Oklahoma and will appear on the General Election ballot.\" The news that West will be on the ballot comes just a day after The Intelligencer reported that he had suspended his campaign despite hiring both \"paid and volunteer\" staff to help him secure signatures in Florida and South Carolina to get him on the ballot. KANYE WEST'S WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN 'HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE' OF HUSBAND'S PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS: REPORT West initially shared his dreams of being the third candidate to run against President Trump and Joe Biden in a tweet on the Fourth of July. \"We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future.

TMZ also reported that West\u2019s family was concerned about his tweet declaring his candidacy and that he was suffering a bipolar episode based on his presidential aspirations. The tabloid added that \u201cour sources say his family and those close to him are worried, but they believe things will stabilize as they have in the past.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy, Pat Ward and Melissa Roberto contributed to this report.",

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.\u00a0had a scathing response to the \"We Have Her Back\" group who vows to be a watchdog to protect Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., from sexist media coverage heading into the 2020 election. She commended the group for taking on the media and pointing out subjective and inconsistent coverage of female candidates, but she scolded them for singling out Harris. \"I would suggest that you seek to have this filter applied to all women in public service\u2014 liberal and conservative,\" Blackburn wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News.\u00a0\"It should be equal treatment regardless of ethnicity or political inclination. Balckburn said that she has had to deal with a double standard in her political career in which she was the first female elected to the Senate from Tennesee, and she still navigates uneven coverage. \"It would be helpful if you would choose to join me in making sure that all voices are heard and all points of view have a platform for respectful discussion and debate,\" she wrote. Last week, before former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden selected Harris as his running mate, several prominent women, including former\u00a0Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and\u00a0Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson, signed an open letter calling on media outlets to refrain from using misogynistic, sexist and racist tropes against the female VP pick. \"We expect change,\" the letter, addressed to news division heads, editors in chiefs, bureau chiefs, political directors, editors, producers, reporters\u00a0and anchors,\u00a0read. \"We expect a new way of thinking about your role in how she is treated and the equality she deserves relative to the three men running for president and vice president.\" FLASHBACK: CNN CONTRIBUTOR WHO WARNED OF SEXIST COVERAGE OF BIDEN VP ONCE MOCKED ANN ROMNEY In her response to the letter, the Tennessee senator said there is a lack of\u00a0\u00a0\"viewpoint diversity\" in the mainstream media and support groups, specifically citing pro-life women who have been targeted.

If you watched last week\u2019s virtual Democratic convention, you heard about an America with which you might not be familiar.\u00a0Speaker after speaker portrayed America as a failing nation full of misery, poverty and angst that only they can make better. On his radio program last week, Rush Limbaugh reminded listeners what the fight for the future of America is about. He played an excerpt from Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural address on Jan. 20, 2017: \u201cThe establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation\u2019s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\u201d ARNON MISHKIN: TRUMP CAN STILL WIN. HERE'S HOW Trump brought back those who had been struggling under the slow-growth Obama-Biden administration. Had it not been for the virus, which is being dealt with (more about that in a moment), Trump would be way ahead in the polls thanks to record employment across all demographics. And still the economy is making a comeback. Check the rising stock market, which has\u00a0hit\u00a0record highs. That is good news for retirees with mutual funds\u00a0and other investment accounts. Contrast Trump\u2019s address with the gloom and doom projected by Joe Biden and his supporters in his professionally produced speech last Thursday night: \u201cHere and now I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I\u2019ll be an ally of the light, not\u00a0the\u00a0darkness. It\u2019s time for us \u2014 for we, the people \u2014 to come together. And make no mistake. United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America.\u201d Clich\u00e9s. Bromides. Meaningless. When he was vice president, Biden and President Barack Obama had a chance to get out in front of the pandemic, which they now blame on Trump. Instead, they did nothing to replenish the stockpile of masks and other needed protective equipment. While this week\u2019s Republican\u00a0National Convention can\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and should\u00a0\u2014\u00a0counter the anti-Trump claims by Democrats, the event should mostly focus on optimism. As a USA Today story put it: \u201c...\u00a0according to NIH, the stockpile\u2019s resources were also used during hurricanes Alex, Irene, Isaac and Sandy. Flooding in 2010 in North Dakota also called for stockpile funds to be deployed. The 2014 outbreaks of the\u00a0Ebola virus and botulism, as well as the 2016 outbreak of the Zika virus, continued to significantly tax the stockpile\u00a0with\u00a0no serious effort from the Obama administration to replenish the fund.\u201d\u00a0(emphasis mine) CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER They can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned.

About 400 members of the National Guard will be deployed in Wisconsin to compensate for any shortages of poll workers in the state for Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, Gov. Tony Evers said Tuesday. Evers, a Democrat, compared the Guard assignment to the role its personnel has already played in assisting with the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe Wisconsin National Guard has played a critical role in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and this mission is no different,\" Evers said, according to The Associated Press. \"As Wisconsin faces an urgent crisis with more than 200,000 positive cases of COVID-19 across the state, the help of the Guard will be needed to ensure that Election Day goes smoothly and that voters and election officials alike have the assistance they need.\u201d WISCONSIN REPUBLICAN PARTY SAYS HACKERS STOLE $2.3M Evers hinted at a possible Guard deployment earlier this month. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers is seen in Madison, Wis., July 30, 2020. (Associated Press) The 400 Guard members will be a smaller number, however, than were deployed in Wisconsin for its April presidential primary and August down-ballot elections, the AP reported. For those elections, 2,400 and 700 Guard members were deployed respectively, the report said. SUPREME COURT RULES THAT BALLOTS IN WISCONSIN MUST BE RECEIVED BY ELECTION DAY The state is currently expecting a shortage of about 200 poll workers from the 30,000 or so needed for Tuesday\u2019s voting, Wisconsin Elections Commission leader Meagan Wolfe told the AP. Guard members deployed in the state will be serving in their local communities and won\u2019t be wearing uniforms, Wolfe said. Just days ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, Wisconsin remained a key battleground state, with 10 electoral votes at stake. President Trump was scheduled to appear in Green Bay on Friday while Democrat Joe Biden was set to visit Milwaukee, FOX 6 of Milwaukee reported. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both Wisconsin cities ranked among the top 10 in the nation for the number of presidential campaign ads appearing on local TV, the report said. Thursday was the final day for Wisconsin residents to request a mail-in absentee ballot and Friday is the final day for residents to register to vote at their local municipal clerk\u2019s office, the Journal Sentinel of Milwaukee reported. Sunday will be the final day the state\u2019s local clerks can offer in-person absentee voting, the report said. The Associated Press contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court nominee discusses signing open letter calling 'for the unborn to be protected in law' Women\u2019s groups on Monday slammed Senate Republicans for confirming President Trump\u2019s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, saying they participated in a \u201cmalicious theft\u201d of a vacancy on the high court, and called the confirmation process \u201can illegitimate power grab.\u201d The Senate voted to confirm Barrett to the vacancy on the high court left by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Monday. The Senate voted 52-48 on Barrett\u2019s nomination, marking President Trump\u2019s third Supreme Court justice of his administration. The last president to nominate three new justices to the Supreme Court was Ronald Reagan. But Planned Parenthood slammed the confirmation process, and Barrett, as a \u201cthreat\u201d to women\u2019s health and rights. \u201cIn the midst of a global health crisis, with more than 225,000 dead in this country, Mitch McConnell prioritized this sham process over passing desperately needed COVID relief \u2014 and he openly admitted it,\u201d Planned Parenthood Action president Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement after the vote. \u201cSenate majority leadership has compromised the safety and well-being of Americans by ignoring this pandemic, and they\u2019ve done it to confirm a Supreme Court justice who will be an active threat to our health and rights.\u201d Johnson went on to say that this \u201cis a lifetime position, and this partisan, malicious theft of the people\u2019s seat will be felt for generations to come.\u201d \u201cFor decades, this change in the court will threaten our civil rights, access to health care, freedom to marry, legal protections from discrimination, and reproductive health and rights,\u201d Johnson continued. Johnson, though, said that Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the high court is over, but looked ahead to next week\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWe are far from defeated,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis phony confirmation process is over but this election is not. We deserve leaders who respect our wishes and who champion our health and rights \u2014 and we\u2019re going to make absolutely sure these senators and Donald Trump know that.\u201d Planned Parenthood provides patients access to a wide range of health and reproductive health services, including birth control and abortions. Meanwhile, EMILY's List, a PAC that supports Democratic women running for office on abortion rights platforms, slammed the confirmation of Barrett just week\u2019s before Election Day an \u201cillegitimate power grab.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what we just witnessed from Senate Republicans so that they can overturn the Affordable Care Act, undermine reproductive freedom, and jeopardize our fundamental rights,\u201d EMILY\u2019s List tweeted shortly after Barrett was confirmed to the high court Monday night. Barrett, a devout Catholic, has been criticized by women\u2019s groups and those on the left for her views on abortion, but the now-Supreme Court Justice during her confirmation hearing earlier this month declined to respond to questions about abortion cases before the high court, saying she \u201ccannot pre-commit\u201d while saying she has \u201cno agenda.\u201d Barrett simply stated that she will \u201cobey all the rules\u201d and will apply \u201call factors\u201d relating to precedent and \u201creliance and workability.\u201d \u201cAll the standard factors,\u201d Barrett explained. \u201cAnd I promise to do that for any issue that comes up, abortion or anything else, I\u2019ll follow the law.\u201d It's common practice for court\u00a0nominees to stay quiet about how they would rule on certain issues so as not to prejudge the cases that could come before them. So senators rely on past statements, legal writings and court opinions to understand how a nominee would rule on Roe v. Wade. Barrett has been scrutinized by Democrats over how her faith could influence her work, dating back to her confirmation to the 7th U.S.\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017. During the hearing, Barrett, a Catholic mother of seven, had to assert numerous times that her faith would not influence her jurisprudence. In a 2013 Texas Law Review article, Barrett listed fewer than 10 cases she said are widely considered \u201csuper-precedents,\u201d ones that no justice would dare reverse even if they believed they were wrongly decided. Among them was Brown vs. Board of Education, which declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. One she didn\u2019t include on the list: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that affirmed a woman\u2019s right to abortion. Scholars don\u2019t include it, she wrote, because public controversy swirling around it has never abated. Abortion and women's rights were the focus of the\u00a0bruising 2017 confirmation process after Barrett's nomination to the 7th Circuit. Others pointed to Barrett's membership of the University of Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cFaculty for Life\u201d group \u2013\u00a0and that she had signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops affirming the \u201cvalue of human life from conception to natural death.\u201d Despite concerns from Democrats, Barrett, in a\u00a01998\u00a0Notre Dame Law School review article, wrote that \u201cJudges cannot \u2014 nor should they try to \u2014 align our legal system with the Church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge. They should, however, conform their own behavior to the Church's standard. Perhaps their good example will have some effect.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha weighs in on the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of election celebrations vs. Trump rallies on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019 Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential race Saturday and just like that, CNN seemed to almost move on from\u00a0the COVID crisis. That\u2019s entirely expected. The Biden PR operation formerly known as a news network has been flexible in its warnings about how contagious the virus is and what to do about it. It\u2019s a pretty simple calculation actually, CNN gets more upset about COVID-19 when it involves people on the right. Yes, they will note the Biden crowds aren\u2019t socially distancing and show some concern for masks. But CNN saves its viral anger for Trump. On Saturday, CNN staffers complained that they were being unfairly characterized as downplaying the virus at Biden events. They did discuss masks and social distancing on CNN several times. As reported by Fox News, \u201cCNN left-wing anchor Jake Tapper appeared reluctant to come off as a nuisance to Biden supporters who were celebrating in the streets on Saturday. #FACTSFIRST: JAKE TAPPER, CNN\u2019S CORONAVIRUS DOUBLE STANDARD ON TRUMP AND BIDEN RALLIES EXPOSED \u2018We\u2019re also seeing people wearing masks\u2026 mostly wearing masks, they\u2019re not socially distancing. I hate to be a scold here but we just had the highest day of infections in the United States,\u201d Tapper told viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see people wearing masks, for some of them, they\u2019re slipping off their face, people also need to socially distance themselves, the masks are significant, though, they are the thing that doctors say are most important.\u2019\u201d And Anderson Cooper noted, \u201cClearly, there is not a lot of social distancing going on which is unfortunate given the raging pandemic that we have.\u201d On Sunday, in an interview with Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders, as Fox News reported, \u201cTapper asked Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders about the situation while reiterating that the partyers mostly wore masks.\u201d However, CNN still reserved its harshest comments for the president. Anchor Jake Tapper was complaining again Saturday that Trump \u201cheld superspreader events across the country.\u201d He followed that rant by chuckling as he watched his native Philadelphians \u201cin the street\u201d celebrating. \u201cThey\u2019re very happy,\u201d he said, quickly moving on from COVID concerns. PRO-TRUMP ACTRESS KIRSTIE ALLEY SLAMS CNN'S COVID COVERAGE: \u2018FEAR OF DYING IS THEIR MANTRA\u2019 It\u2019s a fact that CNN freaked out a lot more when conservatives gathered. When Trump held rallies, CNN called them a \u201cpotential superspreader sprint to win reelection.\u201d Here are four notable examples of CNN upset with conservatives about the virus. Followed by the one time they actually downplayed the virus (because it was CNN\u2019s own event!) 1. Trump goes for a car ride CNN finally found a reason to care about law enforcement. When the president went to Walter Reed Medical Center for COVID-19 treatment, the network went ape. First they freaked out about it, even implying there was a \u201cdeath watch\u201d going on for him. But when Trump stomped on that theory, CNN wigged out even more. The leader of the free world decided to take a drive around the block to appease his gathered fans and calm allies and markets with proof that he was doing OK. CNN couldn\u2019t stand it. Host Ana Cabrera criticized Trump for \u201cputting those Secret Service drivers and members who are protecting him in this moment at risk.\u201d Even though they were wearing protective gear and it\u2019s their job to be put at risk around the president. Some even get shot doing so. Senior political analyst David Gergen declared Trump \u201cwants to be at the center of attention.\u201d 2. Black Lives Matter protests are no risk, but Trump rallies are dangerous CNN medical analyst Leana Wen claimed that Black Lives Matter protests are safer than Trump events. Wen, the unbiased former Planned Parenthood president, said the difference is the attitude they have attending the events. Trump supporters dare to attend \u201cin defiance.\" And that makes all the difference! She claimed that, \u201cAt protests many people are aware of the risks and doing everything they can to reduce that risk versus at many of the rallies we are seeing people going in defiance.\u201d Apparently, she\u2019s watching different events than the rest of America. 3. The great unmasking event President Trump survived the coronavirus and went back to work. On his return, he stepped out onto the White House balcony and took off his mask to greet hundreds of his supporters. Even though he was far from the crowd, that was too much for Trump-hating CNN. \u201cTrump's reckless return met with a dramatically changed White House,\u201d it wrote. Another \u201canalysis\u201d argued, \u201cit was clear that his illness has taught him very little and he will continue to endanger Americans until Election Day.\u201d CNN even bashed the speech itself as \u201cdark and divisive.\u201d It turns out that the hysterics were misplaced. According to CNN itself, \u201cTrump's physician Dr. Sean Conley announced in a memo that Trump no longer poses a coronavirus transmission risk.\u201d 4. CNN hypes anti-Trump billboard to make its point The left loves to create phony news with micro-protests and the news media lap it up. In this case, CNN anchor Erin Burnett used an Iowa billboard to attack the president. CNN headlined the story: \u201cTrump rally billboard says 'superspreader event this way.' (Literally.)\u201d Of course, the billboard was actually the work of Rural America 2020, one of many anti-Trump groups. But Burnett used it to fuel a rant blasting Trump for holding an event in Iowa. She stared at the video and said, \u201cI see a mask. I see one mask. You get the point,\u201d even though several were visible. Yes, we got the point. CNN took any chance to mock Trump supporters or Trump over masks. Hmmm. THE CNN EXCEPTION ON COVID Yes, CNN\u2019s own global town hall earlier this year argued against \u2026 masks In April, CNN blasted Trump\u2019s early actions on the virus. The network whined that the president did little in February, calling it \u201cThe lost month.\u201d It even produced a timeline. On March 5, the very same CNN held a public town hall called \u201cCNN Global Town Hall Facts and Fears\u201d \u00a0about the virus. It packed in at least 64 people shoulder-to-shoulder in three rows to watch Anchor Anderson Cooper and CNN Chief Correspondent Sanjay Gupta tell the world that wearing masks was dangerous. Yep, here\u2019s the actual Gupta quote: \u201cFor someone who's healthy, it's not going to protect you against the virus,\" he said. \u201cIt may actually become a reservoir when you're taking it on, when you're taking it off. You could actually contaminate yourself. It traps viral particles. It doesn't do what people think it would do.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And, being fair to CNN, maybe they didn\u2019t know enough to not hold a public town hall on a deadly virus. Except CNN\u2019s own coronavirus page on that date noted that: \u201cRome marathon canceled over coronavirus fears\u201d and \u201cAlmost 300 million students across the world are out of school due to coronavirus.\u201d Yet CNN went ahead and held a public town hall.

Former Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0CEO\u00a0Alexis McGill Johnson\u00a0are among the\u00a0group of influential women who\u00a0sent\u00a0a letter to\u00a0media industry leaders\u00a0on Friday\u00a0urging them to avoid stereotypes\u00a0when covering Biden\u2019s female running mate, according to Axios. HERE'S WHO BIDEN MAY BE CONSIDERING AS HIS RUNNING MATE \u201cWe are reaching out now because we are about to embark on a historic moment - once again - having a woman on a Presidential Campaign ticket. While you have already done significant reporting on the process, we know you are actively preparing for coverage about the specific Democratic Vice Presidential nominee,\u201d began\u00a0the letter\u00a0addressed to news division heads, editors in chiefs, bureau chiefs, political directors, editors, producers, reporters\u00a0and anchors. \u201cGiven how few women have reached this point, the sometimes disappointing coverage of the process to date and the double standards we\u2019ve seen in the public and media expectations of women leaders over the years - and even more so for Black and Brown women leaders - we wanted to respectfully share some thoughts with you about the media\u2019s role in the scrutiny and coverage of women and women of color candidates in general, and the vice-presidential candidate in particular,\u201d the letter continued. The letter then\u00a0emphasized changes that newsrooms have made in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s Memorial Day death in police custody, such as \u201cincluding more Black people and people of color on the front lines of reporting and behind the scenes producing and editing\u201d and urged media industry leaders to do the same thing when covering Biden\u2019s running mate. BIDEN SPENDING WEEK HOLDING ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WITH RUNNING MATE CONTENDERS Biden announced in March that he would name a woman as his running mate.\u00a0According to some Biden confidants, the presumptive nominee has narrowed down his choice of running mates to Susan Rice, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama,\u00a0and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. \u201cA woman VP candidate, and possibly a Black or Brown woman candidate, requires the same kind of internal consideration about systemic inequality as you undertook earlier this year,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAnything less than full engagement in this thoughtful oversight would be a huge step backwards for the progress you have pledged to make to expand diversity of thought and opportunity in your newsrooms and in your coverage.\u201d The letter, which was signed by leaders from\u00a0National Women\u2019s Law Center\u00a0NARAL,\u00a0National Partnership for Women and Families,\u00a0Supermajority,\u00a0Emily\u2019s List and\u00a0TimesUp, in addition to Planned Parenthood, said that women\u00a0have been subject to \u201cstereotypes and tropes about qualifications, leadership, looks, relationships and experience\u201d for years. The women have formed a group called\u00a0\u201cWe Have Her Back,\u201d which plans to monitor coverage of Biden\u2019s selection. KAREN BASS, ON BIDEN VP SHORTLIST, SCRAMBLES TO EXPLAIN REMARKS ON CASTRO, SCIENTOLOGY \u201cThose stereotypes are often amplified and weaponized for Black and Brown women. Attempts at legitimate investigations of a candidate have repeatedly turned into misguided stories that perpetuate impressions of women as inadequate leaders, and Black and Brown women as worse,\u201d the letter said before listing multiple examples of how media coverage has \u201chas contributed to the facts of the lack of diversity at the top of society\u2019s roles.\u201d The examples included\u00a0reporting on a woman\u2019s ambitions\u00a0\u201cas though the very nature of seeking political office, or any higher job for that matter is not a mission of ambition,\u201d reporting a woman\u2019s likeability, noting a woman\u2019s appearance,\u00a0questioning electability, doubting a woman\u2019s leadership ability and suggesting that women\u00a0are\u00a0too emotional or irrational. \u201cWe are certain that if you pursue thoughtful conversation internally, you will find even more examples of how these stereotypes can seep into coverage, and thereby seep into the public consciousness as voters are seeking to understand those seeking office,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe believe it is your job to, not just pay attention to these stereotypes, but to actively work to be anti-racist and anti-sexist in your coverage (ie: equal) as this political season progresses and this Presidential ticket is introduced. As much as you have the public\u2019s trust, you also have great power. We urge you to use it wisely.\u201d The women who signed the letter then\u00a0offered assistance\u00a0and said they would meet with media industry leaders if needed. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThis is a defining election no matter your viewpoint. We intend to collectively and individually monitor coverage and we will call out those we believe take our country backwards with sexist and/or racist coverage,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs we enter another historic moment, we will be watching you. We expect change. We expect a new way of thinking about your role in how she is treated and the equality she deserves relative to the three men running for President and Vice President. Your great institutions, the ideals you serve, and our country, deserve no less.\u201d If he chooses Rice or Harris, either would become the first woman and first African-American vice president in U.S. history should Biden best President Trump in November\u2019s general election.

            "article_content": " Democratic nominee Joe Biden took the high road in regards to President Trump's controversial Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, during Tuesday's debate, saying she seems like a \"very fine person.\" His comment comes amid strong opposition from Democrats to pushing through a\u00a0conservative judge to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg, who died earlier in September, just weeks before the presidential election. The party has leveled accusations of hypocrisy against Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refused to consider a similar nomination from\u00a0former President Obama nine months before the 2016 election on the grounds that voters needed to weigh in. KAMALA HARRIS PARROTS BIDEN AFTER DEBATE, REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER THEY WILL 'PACK' SUPREME COURT \"I'm not opposed to the justice,\" Biden said on the debate stage in Cleveland, Ohio. \"She seems like a very fine person.\" Instead, Biden urged Trump to wait for election results in November before the vacancy is filled. \"We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view,\" Biden said. CHELSEA CLINTON CALLS FOR HOLDING UP BARRETT NOMINATION In the fiery first round of the debate, Trump insisted that he has \"plenty of time\" to choose and win confirmation for a nominee, which would give conservatives a majority in the highest court in the country. \"We won the election. Elections have consequences,\" Trump said, justifying why\u00a0he appointed a nominee in an election year. \"I'm not elected for three years,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"I'm elected for four years.\" BIDEN DODGES DEBATE QUESTION ON COURT-PACKING TO APPEASE RADICAL LEFT: SEN. COTTON Trump's nominee, Barrett, has\u00a0faced attacks\u00a0from liberal women's groups and Planned Parenthood, which says\u00a0she is a threat to women's reproductive rights. Democrats worry that if she is appointed to the Supreme Court, she will help to roll back abortion rights as well as the Affordable Care Act. Barrett, a federal appellate judge\u00a0and\u00a0former law clerk of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia -- whose death created the vacancy that the Senate wouldn't allow Obama to fill -- has\u00a0been questioned about her faith numerous times, an issue that will likely come up again during her confirmation hearings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Although she has testified to Congress previously that she would not let her religious beliefs interfere with her decisions on the court, some have questioned whether she has given an oath of loyalty to\u00a0a Christian group called People of Praise that could compromise her impartiality. Barrett has been linked to the group by the Associated Press and other news outlets, though she hasn't commented on her involvement. The group itself is the subject of speculation that it inspired the Margaret Atwood novel and popular Hulu drama, \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" a claim it has denied. Members pledge their\u00a0lifelong commitment to a\u00a0covenant and are assigned personal advisers,\u00a0originally called \"heads\"\u00a0if men and \"handmaids\" if women.",

WARNS OF 'SILENCED MAJORITY' AT RNC CONVENTION \u201cSince speaking at the Republican Convention four\u00a0years ago, so much has changed for the world, for our country, and for my family,\u201d she said, noting that she, \u201clike so many students across the world,\u201d graduated from law school during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOur generation is unified in facing the future in uncertain times \u2014 and many of us are considering what kind of country we want to live in,\u201d Tiffany Trump said, noting that she can relate to \u201cso many\u201d who are looking for a job during the pandemic. \u201cMy father built a thriving economy once, and believe me, he will do it again,\u201d she said.

Why is one viewpoint promoted while others are hidden?\u201d REPUBLICANS OFFICIALLY RE-NOMINATE TRUMP AT GOP CONVENTION \u201cThe answer is control \u2014\u00a0and because division and controversy breeds profit,\u201d she said.

Tina Smith is running in\u00a0her second race in two years as she faces a tight contest with Republican rival\u00a0Jason Lewis. The senator previously served as chief of staff for Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, and chief of staff for Minnesota\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Mark Dayton in 2011. In 2014 she ran to for\u00a0lieutenant governor and won with Dayton at the top of the state ticket. Dayton appointed her to fill the state's empty Senate\u00a0seat at the end of 2017 after former Sen. Al Franken resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. In 2018, she won a special election to serve the remainder of Franken's term, which ends in January, and now she is running to serve a full six-year term. Smith touts that as lieutenant governor, she\u00a0helped bring free kindergarten to all Minnesota families, raise the state minimum wage, expand workers'\u00a0medical leave, legalize same-sex marriage\u00a0and invest\u00a0in agriculture. \"In my first year in the Senate, I worked hard across party lines to get things done for Minnesotans.

COURT RULING LEAVES MINNESOTA MAIL-IN BALLOTS IN LIMBO AFTER NOV. 3 Smith is also in favor of popular progressive policies including\u00a0gun reform, making education more affordable,\u00a0investing in clean energy, immigration reform and police reform. 4. Smith addressed the #MeToo movement after replacing\u00a0Franken in 2017 Smith was selected to replace Franken\u00a0in 2017 after he resigned following sexual misconduct allegations from a number of women. TRUMP VOWS 'COMEBACK' IN CAMPAIGN'S CLOSING MESSAGE, CLAIMS BIDEN WILL 'LOCK DOWN YOUR STATE' Franken said at the time that\u00a0Smith's \"record of accomplishment as lieutenant governor demonstrates that she'll be an effective senator who knows how to work across party lines to get things done for Minnesota.\" During her first speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the newly appointed senator addressed the #MeToo movement against sexual assault.

Voters in rapper Kanye West's home state of Illinois could see him on the presidential ballot come November running as an independent. Four minutes before the Illinois State Board of Elections 5 p.m.\u00a0CT deadline, two representatives filed 412 petition sheets with election officials, a spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. Election officials will be counting those signatures of registered Illinois voters, of which he was supposed to have had at least 2,500 to get on the ballot. Petition sheets usually contain 10 names per sheet. Filing before the deadline doesn't necessarily mean West has a guaranteed spot on the ballot. Officials still need to count how many signatures his representatives have turned in on his behalf. There is a challenge period starting tomorrow morning and running till next Monday, where anyone can lodge a reasonable objection to West's candidacy. If there are no credible objections adjudicated by the Board of Elections by August 21 and if West garnered the proper amount of signatures, then he would appear\u00a0on the ballot as an independent in Illinois. Earlier today, he missed the deadline in South Carolina, failing to turn anything in. There, he needed 10,000 signatures to mount a run. He will be on the ballot as an independent in Oklahoma, however, after he paid a onetime fee of\u00a0$35,000 for his name to appear there.

            "article_content": " As Amy Coney Barrett answered senators' questions for more than 11 hours Tuesday she discussed a number of court cases, some written by her and some by the Supreme Court justices she aims to join by the end of the month, while\u00a0the Judiciary Committee sought to divine her views on issues from gun rights to abortion. Some of the cases were household names, like Roe v. Wade, and others were more obscure, like Kanter v. Barr, but all important to understand as the American public gets what will likely be its last glimpse of Barrett speaking publicly before she assumes a lifetime tenure on the highest court in the land. Here are some of the court cases to know as the Barrett confirmation hearings continue. WHERE HAS AMY CONEY BARRETT RULES ON KEY ISSUES? 1. Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey Roe v. Wade is the Supreme Court case from 1973 that prevents states from banning abortion and has been one of the most contentious decisions by the high court for decades. It grounded an individual right for women to choose abortion in an individual right to privacy the justices say they found contextually\u00a0in the Fourteenth Amendment. Planned Parenthood v. Casey is a case from 1992 that upheld the fundamental holding of Roe and is part of the reason why some Democrats consider Roe to be a \"super precedent,\" or a case that is so widely accepted it would be out of bounds for the Supreme Court to consider overturning it. Barrett under questioning from multiple senators declined to say that Roe is a \"super precedent,\" \u201cI'm answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn\u2019t fall into that category,\" Barrett said in response to questioning from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on Tuesday. BARRETT SAYS ROE V. WADE IS NOT A 'SUPER PRECEDENT' THAT CANNOT BE OVERTURNED 2. Kanter v. Barr Kanter v. Barr is not a Supreme Court case, but instead perhaps the most high-profile opinion that Barrett has written in her time as an appeals court judge. At question in the case was a Wisconsin law taking gun rights away from all felons, even those who were found guilty of nonviolent crimes. Judges Joel Flaum and\u00a0Kenneth Ripple, who were appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote the majority opinion in the case and upheld the law. But Barrett dissented, saying that while governments have the power to take away gun rights from dangerous people, but that being convicted of a nonviolent felony does not necessarily make people dangerous. \"History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns,\" Barrett wrote. \"But that power extends only to people who are\u00a0dangerous.\" She added: \"[W]hile both Wisconsin and the United States have an unquestionably strong interest in protecting the public from gun violence, they have failed to show, by either logic or data ... that disarming Kanter substantially advances that interest.\" 6 KEY MOMENTS FROM DAY TWO OF AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CONFIRMATION HEARING Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., brought up the Kanter case Tuesday, criticizing Barret for giving Second Amendment gun rights more \"respect\" than voting rights. Barrett responded by noting that \"the Constitution contemplates that states have the freedom to deprive felons of the right to vote,\" and distinguishing between civic rights like voting and individual rights like gun ownership. She added that she was not expressing a personal view on the policy option of states taking away felon voting rights. 3. California v. Texas Democrats are making the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, central to their campaign pitch, and by extension, it's becoming central to their grilling of Barrett in the Judiciary Committee hearings. The Trump administration is backing a lawsuit brought by a group of red states called California v. Texas, which aims to overturn the ACA based on the fact that there is no longer a financial penalty associated with the individual mandate to buy health insurance in the law. The Supreme Court choosing to read\u00a0that provision as a tax was the key reason why it was not ruled unconstitutional in a previous challenge, NFIB v. Sebelius. But because there is no longer any money being collected by that provision, the red states behind the suit argue that it's now\u00a0simply\u00a0an unconstitutional mandate to purchase a certain product, arguing that Congress\u00a0cannot force people to buy insurance \"any more than it can order them to buy a new car or broccoli.\" Barrett was previously critical of the Supreme Court's reading of the individual mandate as a tax in writings before she was appointed as a judge. Democrats are seizing on that as both an argument against Barrett's confirmation and an election-year base-mobilizing issue to argue against Trump. However the California v. Texas case, Barrett said Tuesday, hinges\u00a0on a different issue -- the concept of \"severability.\" The blue states opposing the red state suit, in addition to continuing to argue that the individual mandate is constitutional even without the financial penalty, say that if the Supreme Court finds that provision unconstitutional that it is severable from the rest of the ACA. That means the individual mandate could be struck down and the rest of the ACA -- including its protections for those with preexisting conditions -- would remain in effect. Barrett Tuesday said that she hasn't \"written about severability that I know of at all,\" and refused to express a view on it as if she is confirmed she will likely hear the oral arguments in the case set for Nov. 10. Many experts expect that at least some of the more conservative justices will be convinced by the severability argument and vote to uphold most of the ACA. HARRIS TELLS BARRETT GINSBURG WAS 'FAR MORE FORTHCOMING' ABOUT ABORTION VIEWS 4.\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges Obergefell v. Hodges was the landmark Supreme Court ruling that required all states to recognize same-sex marriage. The opinion in that case, written by retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, called sexual orientation \"immutable\" to people. That wording in the opinion was noted by Democrats on Tuesday as they attacked Barrett for a comment she made saying that she would not discriminate against people because of \"sexual preference.\" Sens. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Cory Booker, D-N.J., both lit into Barrett over the comment. \"Let me make clear, 'sexual preference' is an offensive and outdated term,\" Hirono said. \"It is used by the anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not. ... The LGBTQ community should be rightly concerned whether you will uphold their constitutional right to marry.\" \"When you did use the term 'sexual preference'\u00a0earlier today, rather than 'sexual orientation,'\u00a0is there a difference, and what is it?\" Booker asked Barrett. BARRETT WON'T SAY IF ROE V. WADE WAS WRONGLY DECIDED: 'I DON'T HAVE ANY AGENDA' \"Senator, I really \u2014\u00a0in using that word, I did not mean to imply that I think that, you know ... that it is not an immutable characteristic, or that it\u2019s solely a matter of preference,\" Barrett responded.\u00a0\"I honestly did not mean any offense, or to make any statement by that.\" Obergefell recently was attacked by two members of the Supreme Court:\u00a0Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. \"[T]his petition provides a stark reminder of the consequences of Obergefell. By choosing to privilege a novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, and by doing so undemocratically, the court has created a problem that only it can fix,\" Thomas wrote in a dissenting\u00a0opinion joined by Alito. \"Until then, Obergefell will continue to have 'ruinous consequences for religious liberty.'\" 5.\u00a0District of Columbia v. Heller and Citizens United v. FEC Both of these cases were raised by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Tuesday as important rulings that were very close to being decided the opposite way, emphasizing the importance of confirming Barrett to avoid those decisions possibly being overturned. District of Columbia v. Heller established the Second Amendment right to bear arms as an individual right possessed by each American, rather than a collective right.\u00a0Citizens United v. FEC served as the basis for allowing private corporations to spend money on elections as they do in the current political environment, and Cruz noted that the Obama administration in the oral arguments of that case said it was of the opinion that the federal government had the power to ban books under certain circumstances. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both of these decisions are widely decried by Democrats and could be further entrenched if the Supreme Court hears cases on them\u00a0with Barrett on the bench. Bonus cases:\u00a0Some cases that Barrett herself has participated in that could be brought up on Wednesday, but were not major topics on Tuesday, include\u00a0Doe v. Purdue,\u00a0Rainsberger v. Benner, and\u00a0Cook County v. Wolf. Learn more about those here. Fox News' Bill Mears, Joseph A. Wulfsohn and Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.

            "article_content": " President Trump on Saturday announced he has chosen Amy Coney Barrett as his pick to fill the Supreme Court\u00a0seat vacated by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- a move that could\u00a0significantly shift the nation's highest court to the right if she's confirmed by the Senate. \u201cToday it is my honor to nominate one of our nation's most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden alongside Barrett. \"She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution -- Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\u201d REPUBLICANS EYE OCT. 12 FOR START OF SCOTUS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS: SOURCE Judge Amy Coney Barrett applauds as President Donald Trump announces Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, Sept. 26, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Barrett, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, had been considered by Trump for the vacancy left by the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. Trump eventually chose now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh instead, but a source told Fox News that she had been at the front of his mind to fill a vacancy by Ginsburg. Speaking at the White House, Barrett said she understood that \"this is a momentous decision for a president and if the Senate does me the honor of confirming me, I\u00a0pledge to discharge the responsibilities of this job to the very best of my ability.\" \"I love the United States and I love the United States Constitution. I am truly humbled by the prospect of serving on the Supreme Court,\" she said. Both Trump and Barrett paid tribute to Ginsburg, with Trump describing her as a \"legal giant and a pioneer for women.\" Ginsburg, a consistent vote on the court\u2019s liberal wing, died last week at 87. The announcement sets up what is likely to be a fierce confirmation battle as Republicans attempt to confirm Barrett before the election on Nov. 3. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised to put a nominee up for a vote, despite the objections of Senate Democrats -- who cite McConnell\u2019s refusal to give Obama nominee Merrick Garland a hearing in 2016 as why a nominee should not be considered in an election year. McConnell praised Barrett in a statement, saying Trump \"could not have made a better decision.\" \"Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States,\" he said. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham hailed Barrett as \"highly qualified in all the areas that matter \u2013 character, integrity, intellect, and judicial disposition.\" \u201cAs the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I\u2019m very committed to ensuring that the nominee gets a challenging, fair, and respectful hearing,\" he said.\u00a0\"We move forward on this nomination knowing that the President has picked a highly qualified individual who will serve our nation well on the highest court in the land.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, continued to object to the timing of the nomination, and also sought to frame the battle as one over health care. They noted the looming COVID-19 pandemic and a legal battle over ObamaCare, as well as concerns that a conservative court could overturn Roe v Wade -- the landmark 1973 ruling on abortion. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, declared a vote for Barrett as \"a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.\" AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION FIGHT: SENATE GOP HAS MATH ON THEIR SIDE \"By nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, President Trump has once again put Americans\u2019 healthcare in the crosshairs,\" he said, adding he would \"strongly\" oppose her nomination. He also accused Trump and McConnell of \"shamelessly rushing to fill Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat less than 40 days before a presidential election.\" \"Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dying wish was that she not be replaced until a new president is installed. Republicans are poised to not only ignore her wishes, but to replace her with someone who could tear down everything that she built,\" he said.\u00a0\"This reprehensible power grab is a cynical attack on the legitimacy of the Court.\" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden echoed those sentiments. \"The American people know the U.S. Supreme Court decisions affect their everyday lives. The United States Constitution was designed to give the voters one chance to have their voice heard on who serves on the Court,\" he said in a statement.\u00a0\"That moment is now and their voice should be heard. The Senate should not act on this vacancy until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.\" His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, said that conservatives \"intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act & overturn Roe.\" \"This selection would move the court further right for a generation & harm millions of Americans,\" she said.\u00a0\"I strongly oppose Judge Barrett\u2019s nomination.\" Liberal groups, meanwhile, promised to fight the nomination.\u00a0Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson said that \"we can't afford to see this nomination succeed.\" \"Nominating Amy Coney Barrett is a particular insult to the legacy of Justice Ginsburg. Barrett's history of hostility toward reproductive health and rights, expanded health care access, and more demonstrate that she will put Justice Ginsburg's long record of ensuring that everyone receives equal justice under the law at risk,\" she said. A source familiar with the process told Fox News that Oct. 12 is the target date for the beginning of confirmation hearings. This means that Barrett, 48, could potentially be confirmed by the end of the month and just\u00a0days before the election. Barrett, a former Notre Dame professor and a mother of seven, is a devout Catholic and anti-abortion -- beliefs that were flagged by Democrats during her 2017 confirmation hearing to\u00a0the 7th Circuit. \"The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told Barrett. She was eventually confirmed 55-43. Trump also was believed to have been considering candidates including 11th Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa. Trump said publicly that he had five potential picks. A source told Fox News that Trump had taken note of how \u201ctough\u201d Barrett was when she faced a confirmation fight in 2017 and had kept her very much at the front of his mind since then. WHERE HAS AMY CONEY BARRETT STOOD ON IMPORTANT CASES? The source said Trump met her during the considerations on who to replace Kennedy in 2018, talked to a lot of people about her\u00a0and wanted to keep her in place through the Kavanaugh vetting process in case there was an issue. Kavanaugh did face hurdles in his confirmation battle, but that came after his nomination was announced. The source said that after Ginsburg died, Barrett was the only candidate he met and spoke with at length, although he made a few calls to Lagoa because some people were pushing him very hard to do so. But ultimately Barrett was always at the front of Trump\u2019s mind to fill a Ginsburg vacancy. Should she be confirmed, Barrett would be Trump\u2019s third Supreme Court confirmation. That\u2019s more than two-term Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush -- who each put two justices on the court. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP While Democrats have vowed to oppose the pick,\u00a0the Senate math does not appear to be in their favor. Republicans have 53 Senate seats and Barrett only needs 50 to be confirmed -- with Vice President Mike Pence acting as a tie breaker in such a case. So far, only sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have indicated they oppose moving forward with a confirmation before the election. Murkowski has since suggested she still may vote for the nominee. Fox News' John Roberts, Mike Emanuel and Tyler Olson contributed to this report.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: My thanks to Bret. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is THE STORY. We are one week from election night. 69 percent of Americans say this is the most important of their lifetime. This is a hard-fought race and one of the most tumultuous times in American memory. And when those numbers start rolling in on Tuesday night, we'll start to see and break down the trends that we see among voters. One group which will be closely watched are black voters, particularly young black men. President Trump got 13 percent of the black male vote in 2016 that was more than any GOP candidate before him. Both sides seen movement in this group and the campaign spoke directly to them today, starting with the former president who campaigned for Joe Biden in Florida. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: President for black folks since Abe Lincoln. Man, their son-in-law says black folks have to want to be successful. That's the problem. Who are these folks? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment and Asian American unemployment all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: And last night in Philadelphia, the racial strife that has torn across this nation exploded in violence and looting that saw 30 police officers injured after fatal police shooting of a suspect. (VIDEO PLAYING) MACCALLUM: Police were hit with rocks and bricks. One officer was driven over in the street. She is in stable condition tonight. And today, Joe Biden took his pitch to Georgia, showing that Democrats believe that they have a shot at flipping that state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy. He doesn't believe there's systemic racism as a problem. And he won't say black lives matter because they do. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: But this moment from back in May still hangs over his message to black voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a long way until November. We got more questions. BIDEN: You've got more questions, but I'll tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're me or Trump, then you ain't black. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: And the Biden campaign has seen push back from celebrities from Kanye West to Ice Cube to 50 Cent who recently said that he would vote for Trump to keep his taxes from skyrocketing. All of this has opened a door for the president, and it has made some Democrats uneasy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn't want to pay 62 percent of taxes because he doesn't want to go from being 50 Cent to 20 Cent. And I and I had to remind him that he was a black person, so he can't vote for Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: One day later, the rapper appeared to backpedal on Twitter. No word on whether he's decided on his vote. Let's bring in Deroy Murdock, contributing editor for National Review Online and a Fox News Contributor, and Juan Williams, Fox News political analyst and co-host of The Five. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here tonight. Good to have you. DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here, Martha. MACCALLUM: Deroy, let me start with you. With all of that laid out. Talk to me about the black vote. Do you see it changing and if so, how? MURDOCK: Yes, I think a lot of black voters across the country have taken a look at the Democrats who've taken us for granted. They just assume we're just going to line up and vote for him, which usually is the case. And in 2016, Donald J. Trump came out and said, vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? I think there's a lot of black folks still asking that question. Only now he has a whole record to run on. For example, he's been very supportive of school choice. He's provided funding for the D.C. school voucher program, which Joe Biden wants to kill. Steady stream of income for the historically black colleges and universities, among other types of support. The first step back, this is a criminal justice reform measure that's benefited 3100 or so former prisoners who are now back to their normal lives trying to make something of themselves, many of them black. And you've got to put real emphasis on entrepreneurship and opportunity zones. 8700 opportunity zones, about $75 billion in private capital flowing in to create jobs and American dreams in minority communities, many of them black. That sort of thing is very positive. This is actual achievement, actual accomplishment. We saw the lowest black unemployment rate in the country and the lowest black poverty rate in the country. First time in America, we've had black poverty below 20 percent in 2019 before the COVID-19 virus came in and wrecked everything. And now we're bouncing back from that. And I think if the president's four more years of economic growth and booming economy, I think there'd be very good things to come for black people. None of this was achieved under Obama-Biden, they had eight years to do these things and they did none of the above. MACCALLUM: So, Juan, how do you respond to that? And the numbers that we're seeing indicate that young black men, 18 to 44 are more sort of open to the idea of supporting a Republican, in this case, President Trump. Older black men seem to be more in the Biden camp, at least according to some of the numbers out there. What do you say to the list that Deroy just laid out there for why they should consider a Republican candidate? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I think there's always reason to consider a Republican candidate, Martha, because you're looking for different ideas, ideas that might work for you and your family. I just don't see that from President Trump. Deroy makes the case about unemployment, which is something that the president often trumpets. But I think for most black people, you look at the record and you say, wait a minute, at the start of the recession, remember, President Obama came in and the rate there of black unemployment was nearly 18 percent, 17 plus something percent. And then it went down to about 6 percent before President Obama left office. And then as it went down further, President Trump said the lowest unemployment. I think people see that as kind of an empty balloon full of hot air. It's not real, but he likes to trumpet it and say that's evidence of what he's done for the black community. Similarly, he says, I've helped the historically black colleges and universities and people say, well, let's look at the record. And it's pretty much where other presidents have done. So, I think that there's a real issue. MACCALLUM: You need that funding permanent to prevent them from having to keep going back to have that run. WILLIAMS: But there's no difference-- MACCALLUM: Year-after-year. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: There's no difference in the total. But I think the bigger issue is, lots of black - young black men are alienated, Martha, and feel like nobody is looking out for them. And especially you look - you mention the celebrities. They're really talking about taxes. I think, one of them said, so what if he doesn't like black people? It's my taxes for these black celebrities. I think that's a separate issue. But it doesn't speak to what most young black men feel, which is alienated. And the biggest threat is they won't vote. That's why you see Obama on the campaign trail saying to people, get out and vote. That's why you see the NBA athletes, the NFL athletes, even the Major League Baseball players saying get out and vote. MACCALLUM: Deroy, what do you say to that? MURDOCK: Yes, I would say, look, one key variable you've seen is at the end of Obama, -Biden's term, black homeownership was at 41.7 percent. It's up at 47 percent as of the second quarter of 2020. Again, steady growth. This is a very big positive. There was a reduction in unemployment under Obama- Biden, it continued under President Trump because of deregulations, because of tax reductions, a greater more positive pro-business tone out of Washington rather than the Obama-Biden tone, which was, you didn't build that, terrible thing to say to entrepreneurs. This is all very, very positive thing. And if it were not for the Chinese virus, which came in and caused such havoc, I think he'd be well on his way to a huge victory, including a large victory among black Americans. MACCALLUM: A couple of issues that seem to be resonating with some voters to cross the aisle is our school choice, Juan, which is something that I know a lot of - all mothers and all parents would like, or most of them for their children to have, especially in the inner city, where there sometimes the options are not attractive at all. So, school choice is a big issue. The other one that has come up quite a bit lately is the question of abortion. And, I was listening last night on Tucker show, Candace Owens was talking about this with respect to the Amy Coney Barrett ceremony and swearing in. And here's what she - she was speaking directly to black voters and here's what she had to say about this. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CANDACE OWENS, AUTHOR: You may want to take a look at why we as a society are saying there's something wrong with a woman who believes in life, who believes that, you know what, more black children should be born alive. We shouldn't have 400 out of 1000 black babies aborted compared to white Americans, where it's 103 out of 1000 births. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: This is something that Kanye West has spoken out about as well, Juan, 400 out of 1000 black babies, if that number is correct. It is a shocking, shocking number. WILLIAMS: Right, I think everybody in the world would say that's a shocking number. But the reality is that abortion is under the Supreme Court and in our country is a right. It's a matter of privacy. People can make that decision on their own. We shouldn't be telling them; big government shouldn't be intervening in people's lives. Most abortions in this country are not to, you know, sexually indiscriminate teens making. I mean, these are two married women, often women with other children who are making a determination about what's best for their families and for themselves, oftentimes in relationships. So, to me, I just think, again, you're trying to racialize an abortion issue. That to me, is a bigger issue for women of all colors. And certainly, if you ask the American people, it's close to two-thirds who say that they believe Roe v. Wade and abortion rights should be upheld by this court. MACCALLUM: Well, the question is whether or not some neighborhoods are - go ahead, quick note. MURDOCK: Yes, I just make this observation. WILLIAMS: Just a quick note. I wanted to say I agree with you with regard to school choice. And I think most black Americans want school choice and feel that they don't have sufficient options in terms of educating children. But that's not to say that they would immediately, then turn on the teacher's unions who are uptight about what it means-- MACCALLUM: I've got to get a quick thought from Deroy. I hear your point on that. Quickly, Deroy, if you can then. MURDOCK: Briefly, Juan talked about government not intervening in women's lives. Well, that's how about having the government not intervene by funding Planned Parenthood and taking your taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions and kill so many of these black babies who otherwise could be born and go about and have beautiful lives in America. You know, a bare minimum can we say if we're going to have an abortion, pay for it yourself? Let's start there. MACCALLUM: All right, gentlemen, thank you very much, Deroy Murdock and Juan Williams, good to have you both with us tonight. MURDOCK: Good to be here. Thank you. MACCALLUM: Up next, we're going to speak with Brit Hume about some of the missteps or misspoken moments on the campaign trail for Joe Biden and whether the media overall on a number of issues has really given him a pass throughout this campaign. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: As you saw earlier, Joe Biden is campaigning in Georgia today, hoping to flip that state that has largely voted Republican since 1972, with the exception of Carter and Bill Clinton. So, Biden is down by about four, according to RCP in Georgia right now, the former vice president has had to clean up a number of statements in the recent days on transitioning away from oil, fracking and the latest, a big error on what he said is free college plan would cost. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich covering the Biden campaign, as always, today, and she is in Atlanta tonight. Hi, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Martha. The campaign says 290 cars were allowed in with the attendance around 870 people making this the largest of the former VPs events since he's gotten back on the trail, even bigger than the DNC. And it's happening in a reliably red state long considered out of reach to the Democrats. Georgia, as you mentioned, hasn't elected a Democratic president since 1992. And the campaign, though believes that this state is competitive, and it could become part of the path to 270. The local activists out here really laid the groundwork after a series of narrow losses in 2017 and 2018, including Stacey Abrams, who lost the governor's race by about 55,000 votes. Tonight's event also included both Democratic Senate candidates trying to flip seats held by Republican incumbents. Georgia is already seeing record early voting turnout and with the highest percentage of black voters in any battleground state. The final push for the Biden campaign includes an ad blitz and visits from both members of the ticket and their spouses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: There are a lot of pundits who would have guessed four years ago that the Democratic candidate for president in 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia on the final week of the election. But we do because something is happening here in Georgia and across America. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: Biden focused on social and economic justice here, but spent the last few days clarifying his climate and energy policy after his debate night pledged to transition away from fossil fuels. He made two stops in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Then he went back again yesterday, reiterating that he doesn't want to shut down oil fields or eliminate fracking. But a few stumbles this weekend are also creating some hiccups. In a podcast, Biden referred to his campaign's election protection program as an extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization. And the campaign had to correct this statement on 60 Minutes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I can send every single qualified person to a four-year college in their state for 150 billion. I can make sure every single person qualifies community college. You can go and we still have a lot of money left over. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: After our interview, Mr. Biden's staff told us he misspoke and that the cost of free public college could be twice as much as he said. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: There was a small group of about 50 Trump supporters protesting outside the gate here. But I would note it was fewer than I've seen in places like Pennsylvania. And that's significant given that we are in Georgia today, Martha. MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Jacqui. Thank you very much. Jacqui Heinrich on the campaign trail tonight. Joining me now, Fox News Senior Political Analyst Brit Hume. Brit, always good to see you. Thanks for being here. BRIT HUME, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: Seven nights away from the big election. We don't like to make too much of these gaffes and mistakes. However, it feels like so much of the Biden campaign does not get covered very completely. This is one moment that did get a little bit of attention this week. And I think it's worth replaying when it appears that the candidate forgot the first name of the person that he's running against. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Four more years of George. He is going to find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we're going to be in a different world. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Brit, I mean what did you make of that moment? They are now saying that it had to do with the fact that George Lopez was also part of this Zoom call, although it certainly sounds like - it doesn't sound like that when I play that. HUME: No, it doesn't. And look, he had a senior moment. People his age do. I'm the same age he is. I have them sometimes. It means you're forgetful. You can't call things to mind as quickly as you once did. Some of his mistakes, I think of the classic kind of gaffes that Biden has always made. For example, that comment he made, remember about if you can't, he said if you can't figure out whether you're going to vote for me or Trump, you're not black. That was a classic Biden gaffe of the kind of he's made since he was a young man. He's always made a lot of those gaffes. More recently though, we hear that he has these moments where he kind of forgets where he is. Remember earlier this year he was in New Hampshire, in New Hampshire. And he said, what's not to like about Vermont? And then at one point, he couldn't remember that he had met with the Parkland students. He said he'd done it while he was in the White House. He wasn't, he was out of office by that time and had been for some time. These are the kinds of things that elderly people run into. And there's no use pretending otherwise, which is why I think that the strategy that the Biden campaign has engaged in of keeping him campaigning to a minimum is wise because it gives him - he prepares well for debates. He's done well in the debates, in my view. He's had a few moments, but he's done pretty well. And it keeps the focus on Trump and away from any of the kinds of senior moments that Biden might characteristically have makes sense. MACCALLUM: So, there was a piece by Bill McGurn today Saving Private Biden, it was called, and he quotes at the end, Mark Hemingway, he says, the best summary of the new standard election coverage was given by Mark Hemingway. After a particularly funny news conference, he relayed the assessment of a friend watching the press handle Joe Biden is like watching someone make sure a three-year-old wins a candy land. So, you have covered presidential elections for decades, Brit. I mean, why is this happening. Both candidates need to be scrutinized and scrutinized well, I mean that's what this coverage is all about. But he really has not had any. HUME: This coverage of Biden's loss of cognitive function is something he would certainly be expected of any other candidate. Remember, there was a lot of discussion about Ronald Reagan, even back during his reelection campaign as to whether he'd lost it. And he managed to recover after a bad first debate and put those put those matters to rest. But later on, in his presidency, there was a lot of issues raised and reporters were fairly aggressive about it. They didn't have a medical diagnosis. But senility is not a medical term. It's an ordinary garden variety colloquialism, meaning, exhibiting the signs of old age, such as forgetfulness. But this doesn't get - the press will not touch this. They will not touch this, which, of course, makes the Biden strategy work even better. And that has been - that has been the effect of it. And I think that, this boils down to one thing, Martha. Many in the media regarded the election of Donald Trump as a kind of national emergency. And it was up to them, they felt to so treat Trump as to hopefully they saw it, get him out of office, but if not, make sure he didn't get re-elected. And they're doing the best they can in that regard. He gets relentless painless scrutiny and Biden gets very little. MACCALLUM: It's very true, I mean, there's a very thinly veiled effort to sort of make what many in the media just think is the right thing to do, and that's not what they're there for. They're there to cover the story on both sides. Speaking of covering the story, here's you on election night in 2000. Brit, before I let you go, because we're going to be making some calls a week from tonight. And this was a memorable moment that led to a very contentious recount. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUME: Got to interrupt you. We are now calling Fox News now projects George W. Bush, the winner in Florida and thus, it appears, the winner of the presidency of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I just can't believe that was 20 years ago. Brett, you know your thoughts on that and how ugly this thing could possibly get, given what we know so far? HUME: Well, obviously, Martha, I'll never forget that moment because, of course, it wasn't very long thereafter that we had to pull the call back. And then in the wee hours of the morning, we renewed the call. And 37 days later, Bush was declared the winner in Florida and thus the presidency, and he went on to serve two terms. I remember Martha, very well what happened four years later when the key battleground state that was in play that night was Ohio. And we came on before anybody else did and called Ohio. You saw just briefly there the face of Michael Barone before I popped up in that in that clip you showed and Michael Barone was with us that night in 2004, four years later, when we were pretty apprehensive about being first again, was it call that Bush had won the presidency? And we went to Michael and he reeled off a discussion about the state of Ohio and its demographics and so forth. It was dazzling. And I thought to myself, you couldn't have heard him without believing fully that Bush had won Ohio, as indeed he had. And I remember thinking to myself, I love Michael Barone.  MACCALLUM: That's so funny. That was my first election with Fox, that 2004 night. And I remember thinking, wow, OK, we're ready to call Ohio. This is getting pretty exciting. And we're out in a little bit of a limb here, given what happened last time around. I also remember at the convention, I helped Michael Barone because he had a live shot when the balloons were coming down and I was on the side pushing all the balloons out of his face, so that he could speak. HUME: That's what friends are for right Martha. MACCALLUM: We have a lot of hats that we wear. Exactly. Exactly. Thanks, Brit. Great to see you as always. HUME: You bet. MACCALLUM: We'll see you soon. So, the newest justice, Amy Coney Barrett takes the bench as cases involving next week's election already start rolling in, how her vow of judicial independence could soon be put to the test. That's next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY CONEY BARRETT, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: My fellow Americans, even though we judge don't face elections, we still work for you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, that's the first time I've said that since she was sworn in, she can now begin work on the high court as election cases are already stacking up. Among them, challenges from Republicans in key states of North Carolina and Pennsylvania on the deadlines for mail-in ballots. Officials in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania today called on Justice Barrett to recuse herself, arguing, quote, \"troubling is the language that President Trump has used in consideration of this nomination linking it directly to the electoral season at hand with applications for his own reelection.\" Joining me now, Carrie Severino, Judicial Crisis Network chief counsel and policy director and co-author of \"Justice on Trial:\u00a0 The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\" Carrie, good to see her tonight. Let's start there with this from Luzerne County. Do they have legs to stand on in terms of asking her to recuse herself based on comments by the president? CARRIE SEVERINO, POLICY DIRECTOR, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK:\u00a0 No, that has never been the historical standard. You had, for example, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan sat on numerous cases that President Obama was involved in during election year, same thing for Ginsburg and Breyer. It is never been the standard that you have to recuse yourself in cases that involve the president who appointed you, including election-year cases. Simply they are trying to invent something new here. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 I want to show you a sound bite from Joe Biden, because one of the big stories has been whether or not Democrats who are clearly very outraged about the fact that the president did add Amy Coney Barrett to the court at such a late date in this election season, here's what he said about what he would consider doing to change the dynamic there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 There is a question about whether or not -- it's a lifetime appointment, I'm not going to attempt to change that at all. There was some literature among constitutional scholars about the possibility of going from one court to another court, not just always staying the whole time on the Supreme Court, but I have made no judgment, my word. My word is I've made no judgment. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, what you think about that idea that justices should rotate around the federal benches and the Supreme Court rather than just stay on the Supreme Court to serve their term? SEVERINO:\u00a0 Well, sure, he's right, that's something that has been floated by constitutional scholars. So, a question whether you could actually do that by statute or whether you would need a constitutional amendment to change that. But the big thing here is what he's trying not to talk about because none of the -- none of the calls from the left that we've heard or let's rotate judges. It's all about court packing. That is what the liberal voices on the left want to do. That's what Joe Biden doesn't want to acknowledge what his position is on but trust me, if he is forced and pushed by the left, there's no way he would stand up to that pressure and we are seeing that is what the left wants. They want FDR style court packing where you add seats to make the judges into a super legislature rather than having them just sit back and do the judging as we know that Amy Coney Barrett has promised to do. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 And he was in Warm Springs, Georgia today which is one of the homes of FDR. Here's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she was very succinct and to the point in her tweet today. She said expand the court. So, we know where she stands on that. Quick question for you with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, who some say tipped his hand a bit in terms of the way he would view these cases with regard to a contested election. He said -- he says under the U.S. Constitution the state courts do not have a blank check to rewrite state election laws for federal elections. He wrote in a footnote on a concurring opinion in the past. Is he sort of indicating that he doesn't think that states should make changes at this point? SEVERINO:\u00a0 Yes. But what he's saying is totally not controversial, to my opinion. The idea that federal courts and state courts need to be very careful overturning things the legislatures say is something that's very common, it's something that is going to apply both ways. It might help Republicans in some cases, it might help Democrats in other cases. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Carrie Severino, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. Thanks for coming on. SEVERINO:\u00a0 Thanks. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So up next, our panel of undecided voters who have become our friends over the course of this election season, they've mostly made up their minds. They are back to tell you tonight what has finally persuaded them, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Well much has changed since we last checked in with our undecided voters in battleground states, including another presidential debate, a new Supreme Court justice and now with just one week to go, our voters are back to tell us where they are now in their thinking. Joining me is Catherine Schroth of Ohio, she is music teacher who voted for Evan McMullin last time around, Kimberly Brown, also of Ohio, is a charter school enrollment coordinator who voted for Jill Stein in 2016, and Jerry Stepanovich of Michigan is a construction superintendent. He voted for Donald Trump back in 2016. Great to have all of you back with us. Thank you for coming along this road to the election as we all watch in great anticipation. Jerry, let me begin with you. You all sent over some notes about things that have been on your mind in this process and one of the things that jumped out at me was that you said that you felt like you had barely seen Joe Biden during the course of this and that he wasn't really out there. Why does that bother you given the situation in the country with coronavirus? JERRY STEPANOVICH, CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT:\u00a0 Well, Martha, I want to know what he stands for. I want to know what his platform is and I want to know what he's -- day-to-day what he's doing. I mean, I see President Trump out there jumping around to four or five states and you know, we see Joe -- well, we don't see Joe. Where is Joe? That's what we want to know. And if we don't see him, how do we know what is really standing for? The other thing that bothers me is when they do show Joe, it's, you know, 30, 40 people. I see our president and there's four or 5,000. I'm encouraged by that. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, Jerry, you're in Michigan. The president was there today. What's your feel for what's going on there on the ground, you know, as far as you can tell? Which way do you think Michigan is leaning? STEPANOVICH:\u00a0 Well, with my friends, family, I would say we are very -- leaning very heavily to Donald Trump. The people in my industry all want to keep their jobs. They are afraid of what another shutdown would bring to the state of Michigan. I mean, we -- but for my boss, who you know worked his hardest to keep us busy and I'm very grateful for that, and we did stay busy, but another shutdown could be devastating to my industry and to the businesses that we support. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Interesting. And you say that you are now planning -- you are on the fence when we first met, but you are planning to vote for Trump now, is that correct? STEPANOVICH:\u00a0 One hundred percent, Martha. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 OK. All right. Let's bring in Catherine and Kimberly, both from Ohio. Obviously, another battleground state. Kimberly, let me start with you. Where are you and your process right now? Have you made up your mind? KIMBERLY BROWN, CHARTER SCHOOL COORDINATOR:\u00a0 I have. I have actually voted this past Friday. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Good for you. And what went into your thinking and what did you decide? BROWN:\u00a0 Well, here's the thing with me. I don't like Mr. Trump and I did not like Mr. Joe Biden, so my decision was really based upon Mr. Pence and Ms. Kamala Harris. Because what I wanted to know that if they ran into any type of situation, which particular V.P. would actually have the ear of the president. Now the last four years we saw Mr. Pence in action with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is extremely immature, he is not presidential and some of his ideologies are mind-boggling, especially when it comes to women and women of color. And as I thought about his last behavior regarding calling Kamala Harris a monster, there was no way in the world as a colored woman I could actually support anything that Mr. Trump would do. Now looking at Mr. Biden, Mr. Biden, like I said, I'm not a fan of his and I had to go back to 1991 and look at the Anita Hill case when he was the chair of the judiciary committee and she had accused Justice Clarence Thomas when he was nominated by George Bush to be on the Supreme Court and how he shunned a lot of women who were going to support the stories of Anita Hill, so that didn't register with me. So what I looked at, I looked at the debate between Pence and Harris and I had to say to myself, who would be more coachable, who would have an open ear to actually deal with issues regarding (Inaudible) and who would deal with women issues and that would be Kamala Harris. Who would be the most approachable? Kamala Harris. Who would have the ear of the president? Kamala Harris. So, on that note as far as you know, rectifying some of this racial divide, I had to go with someone who would actually speak out on the benefit of every single American, especially now that we are dealing with COVID-19 and that would be the Biden and Harris team. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 OK. All right. Catherine, I know you paid very close attention to this race throughout. Are you any closer to your decision? And what are the factors that are weighing on you tonight? CATHERINE SCHROTH, MUSIC INSTRUCTOR:\u00a0 I am closer. Although it may seem bizarre, but I'm not sure I will know until the minute I'm in that booth. I appreciate all the things that Kimberly said. I've had similar thoughts. I, you know, healthcare is a big thing to me and I don't know that either Biden or Trump have impressed me with that. I like, you know, that Biden wants to cap families at 8.5 percent of their income for health insurance, but it's not sustainable with this public option, so that doesn't really win me over. I am also very concerned about there not being checks and balances as far as if the president and the Senate and the House are all Democrat, that's not the way our democracy was set up and so I am leaning towards voting for Trump and Pence. I am always disappointed and President Trump's behavior, but because we are small business owners and because of the Republican platform, that's the way I'm leaning at this time. But like I said, I go back and forth a lot. I'm not sure I'm going to know until I just actually do it. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 If you could talk to President Trump, Catherine, what would you tell him, you know -- what would you say to him about your decision and what would you ask of him? SCHROTH:\u00a0 I would say that he has his own worst enemy and I would ask him to get rid of his Twitter account and I would ask him to listen, listen to professionals, you know, when we are talking about the pandemic, listen to his people so that he doesn't pour fire on dividing issues and those of the main things I would say. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 OK. All right, it's great to have all of you with us. I just want -- in one word, in one of their names, you know, I know what your preferences are at this point are basically who they are, let me ask you who do you think will win the presidential election one week from tonight? Kimberly. BROWN:\u00a0 Biden-Harris. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Jerry? STEPANOVICH:\u00a0 Trump-Pence. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You think? OK. Catherine, who do you think is going to win regardless of how you feel? SCHROTH:\u00a0 Biden-Harris. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Interesting. OK. Thank you so much, all of you. Great to have you back on the show. Thanks for being with us throughout this very interesting year. Take care, all of you. Be well. SCHROTH:\u00a0 Thank you. You, too. STEPANOVICH:\u00a0 Thank you, Martha. SCHROTH:\u00a0 Bye. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Well, it is the first of three campaign stops today, President Trump giving a big boost to Michigan's Republican Senate candidate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\u00a0 If one thing comes out of this whole group of thousands of people, vote for John James. OK? (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 We get John James' take on what's going on in one of the most important states in the race, coming up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN JAMES (R), SENATE CANDIDATE:\u00a0 Michigan holds the path to the presidency, Michigan holds the path to maintaining a Republican majority in the Senate and protecting our constitutional republic. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 In the race for Senate in Michigan, Republican candidate John James currently trails the incumbent Democrat Gary Peters by about six points. Other polls do show them within the margin of error. James is fighting to turn the traditionally blue seat red, which could prove difficult in a state that hasn't elected on a Republican senator in 26 years. President Trump today urging Michigan voters to turn that around and to make Michigan a pickup for his party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:\u00a0 John had money. He was successful. Where he was really successful is in the military, he could pilot a helicopter better than anybody, I hear. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 John James is running against a senator, U.S. senator that nobody has ever heard of before. Even in Washington, Peters. I said who the hell is Peters? (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Republican Senate candidate John James joins me now. Sir, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Good to have you with us. JAMES:\u00a0 Hey, thanks for having me on. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, I want to start by showing, those who don't know, who Gary Peters is. We did invite your opponent on tonight as well, but here is a sound bite of him talking about your election. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. GARY PETERS (D-MI):\u00a0 Jobs have been lost. Manufacturing sector continues to struggle. The shallow rhetoric of my opponent and the shallow rhetoric of the president are not going to cut it. We need meaningful action. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 What's your response to that, sir? JAMES:\u00a0 All talk from somebody who's been in politics for 30 years, been in Washington for 12, been in the Senate for six and people didn't know his name until an election year. Thirty-three percent of the state had no clue who Gary Peters was and to this day still can't point to a single thing he's done. Gary Peters wants to talk but the Great Lakes but there are still algae, blooms in the Erie, there are still pitfalls in our wells, our babies are still drinking leaded water. He wants to come out last week and say that ACA isn't working for businesses when he's been attacking me on wanting to fix Obamacare, the parts that are broken, and keep the parts that aren't. And he missed all of the small business committee meetings in 2012 and 84 percent in total. He's a ranking member of homeland security and blew off reports, missed meetings, has been the invisible man for the state of Michigan. Senator Peters is all talk, he's a career politician, ineffective. He toes the party line and does whatever Chuck Schumer says. I have experience in the automotive industry, I run an automotive business, there are exactly zero senators who have automotive business experience and that would help our state, bringing results from somebody who understands what it takes to protect livelihood in the real world, not a career politician like Gary Peters. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, the race is tight. You, it's the second time you've run. You lost last time. One of the things that President Trump brought up today is changing -- you know, people changing their votes. We keep hearing about all of the millions of people who have already voted. Actually, Michigan is one of those states that allow you to change your vote. Do you have any sense that people are changing their minds in Michigan at this point? JAMES:\u00a0 Well, I know that people in the state of Michigan are sick and tired of the status quo. Senator Peters, who on his taxpayer-funded gold- plated health care insurance plan that's exempted from ACA, he's hide -- he's hid that from the media. He said that from the people of the state of Michigan the part of the reason why he hid from debates on public access television is because he didn't want to account for his record of ineffectiveness and serving only himself. He didn't want to stand and face the music in front of Michigan's voters with me. I believe that people in the state of Michigan are the reason why we have our internals released today, we are within 1.3 points, 1.3 and there is other polling that has us even closer and some even have us ahead. I believe the people in the state of Michigan have -- MACCALLUM:\u00a0 OK. JAMES:\u00a0 -- very, very sensitive B.S. meters and they are sick and tired of being lied to and you know, quite frankly, if Gary Peters had spent as much time and effort and money into helping the situation in Michigan than attacking a combat veteran, attacking a businessman, then I may not have had to run. We may have had better options, but the status quo doesn't work for folks and Senator Peters is giving more political talking points. The choice is clear in Michigan right now. It's gas lighter in Gary Peters versus a war fighter in me, a career politician versus a combat veteran. It's a businessman versus somebody who gives lip service and we need change in Michigan. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. As we said, we invited Gary Peters on, he's welcome to come on any night this week. It's a tightening race to be sure and Michigan is one of the most pivotal states in this whole race. John James, thank you very much for sharing some time with us tonight. Good to have you here, sir. We are going to take a quick break and we will have more of THE STORY for you on the other side of this break, so stay with us with seven -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 That is THE STORY of this Tuesday, October the 27th, 2020. Seven days away from the big night. As always, THE STORY continues, so we'll see you right back here tomorrow night at seven. Have a great night, everybody.

            "article_content": "Sean Hannity breaks down day two of Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings This week, Democrats struggled to explain why Judge Amy Coney Barrett should not be confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court. The Democrats trotted out hackneyed arguments, suggesting that some political norm had been broken by a Republican president nominating a judge to be confirmed as a justice by a Republican Senate in an election year. In fact, there have been 19 times where a seat became vacant in an election year and both the presidency and Senate were controlled by the same party, resulting in 17 judicial confirmations. But Democrats suggested that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish to leave her seat open until a Democrat takes power represented a sort of binding legal commitment. 6 KEY MOMENTS FROM DAY TWO OF AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CONFIRMATION HEARING And they fumed. They fumed that Barrett refuses to pledge fealty to their political priorities. They fumed that Barrett has stated that the role of the judiciary is not to achieve moral ends but to enforce the law. The Democrats fumed that Barrett had the temerity to state that \"courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,\" that \"the policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches\" and that she has done her utmost to \"reach the result required by the law,\" whatever her preferences might be. That's because, in the view of the political left, the court ought to be merely another weapon in its political arsenal. Conservatives see the judiciary as Alexander Hamilton characterized it in \"Federalist No. 78\": as the \"least dangerous\" branch, capable of \"neither force nor will, but merely judgment,\" an institution whose legitimacy rests on its unwillingness to \"exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT.\" Liberals see the court as a super legislature, designed to act as a moral arbiter on behalf of progressive values. That's why former President Barack Obama stated that judges ought to be selected for the quality of \"empathy, of understanding and identifying with people's hopes and struggles, as an essential ingredient for arriving at just decisions and outcomes.\" Critical legal theorists have suggested that conservatives are fibbing \u2014 that their view of the judiciary as relegated to judgment alone is merely cover for the reinforcement of their political priorities. But the data suggests otherwise. During the 2019 Supreme Court term, for example, out of some 67 decisions, the four justices appointed by Democrats voted together 51 times; Republican appointees only voted together 37 times. As Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute has pointed out, \"it's the (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg Four that represent a bloc geared toward progressive policy outcomes.\" Republican appointees, in other words, are politically heterodox significantly more often than Democratic appointees. That's because, on a fundamental level, they take their job \u2014 and the constitutional separation of powers \u2014 seriously.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Democrats do not. That's why they see as the glories of the Supreme Court those moments in which the Supreme Court seized power on behalf of progressive ideals. Roe v. Wade has become holy writ on the political left, specifically because it robbed the American people of their right to vote on the issue of abortion. Democrats see nothing but glory in Supreme Court justices seizing authority to protect abortion on behalf of defining \"one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life\" (Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992). Democrats see nothing but wonder in Supreme Court justices declaring that the judiciary has been delegated enforcement of \"a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning\" (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats see nothing but cause for celebration in the Supreme Court cramming down on the American people their own sense of our \"evolving standards of decency\" (Trop v. Dulles, 1958) or the importance of never-before-defined \"emanations\" and \"penumbras\" (Griswold v. Connecticut, 1965). They want the court to act as an oligarchy. And the Democrats are angry that Barrett's nomination has moved the court away from that progressive, oligarchic rule. That's why they're threatening to pack the court \u2014 because they wish to restore that oligarchy to power. And that's just another reason why, for all the talk about President Trump's threats to core American institutions, he can't hold a candle to even mainstream Democratic willingness to trash checks and balances on behalf of power.

            "article_content": "New Fox News poll shows presidential race closes to 5 points; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' President Trump sought to align Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party on Monday evening \u2013 arguing that a Biden White House would steer the United States toward socialism as he made his pitch to Latino voters in the battleground state of Arizona. Noting that many Hispanic-Americans emigrated to the U.S from countries ruled by socialist or communist leaders \u2013 specifically mentioning Venezuela and Cuba \u2013 Trump argued that the far-left wing of the Democratic Party would use Biden to enact their policy proposals if he is elected this November. \u201cMany Hispanic-Americans came here to pursue the American dream,\u201d Trump said during a roundtable event in Phoenix before claiming that the Democrats \u201care asking for an American nightmare of whatever you want to call it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be another Venezuela,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen to our country.\u201d BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A 'CLIMATE ARSONIST' Home to the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, Venezuela was for decades an economic leader in the western hemisphere and, despite a massive gap between rich and poor, was a major destination for neighboring Colombians and other Latin Americans fleeing their less prosperous and more troubled homelands. But in recent years, the country has been gripped by widespread malnutrition, disease and violence, and critics accuse strongman leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of unfairly winning an election in 2018 for a second six-year term by banning his popular rivals from running and jailing others. Trump\u2019s comments come amid a sweep of western states over the last two days, where he has attempted to appeal to Latino voters in the run-up to the November 3 election. While Monday\u2019s roundtable was billed as a \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d event \u2013 and felt more like a campaign rally with a raucous and vocal crowd in attendance \u2013 the president faces an uphill battle when it comes to winning over Hispanic voters. Latinos historically vote Democrat \u2013 with the Pew Research Center noting that 69 percent of Hispanic voters cast a ballot for Democrats in the 2018 midterm election compared to just 29 percent for Republicans \u2013 and Trump\u2019s hardline rhetoric on immigration has isolated him from many first- and second-generation Latino voters. This year, a record 32 million Latinos across the country will be eligible to vote, making them the largest minority electorate for the 2020 election, and, in Arizona, which is poised to be a close race between Trump and Biden, Latinos are projected to make up one-fourth of the vote, according to Pew. During his roundtable on Monday, Trump stayed away from discussing immigration and instead focused on his administration\u2019s economic achievements, while touting his \u201cunwavering devotion to the Hispanic-American community.\u201d TRUMP SLAMS BIDEN OVER 'RADICAL LEFT' RIOTS IN NEW WISCONSIN, MINNESOTA ADS The president\u2019s talk about the economy is part of a shift in his campaign to move away from his \u201claw and order\u201d message and toward making the economy the \u201cdefining issue\u201d in the late stages of the presidential election season. A campaign official on Monday touted to Fox News the president\u2019s efforts in terms of job creation, saying that the Trump administration has seen 10.6 million jobs created in the last four months -- which followed historic job losses amid the coronavirus pandemic -- while\u00a0billing it as \u201cthe single greatest period of job creation in the history of this country.\u201d \u201cWhen you look at just August, which was 1.4 million jobs, that is 2.5 times the number of jobs created in the entirety of the eight years that Joe Biden was vice president,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd so people want to vote for a president who will reopen the economy and knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Trump\u2019s push to win over Latino voters also comes amid reports that there's mounting anxiety among Democrats that the Biden campaign's standing among Latinos is slipping. Concerns about Biden's strength were driven in part by an NBC-Marist poll released last week, which found Latinos in Florida \u2013 another key state with a large Hispanic population - are about evenly divided between Biden and Trump. Hillary Clinton led Trump by a 59% to 36% margin among Latinos in the same poll in 2016 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hispanic voters in Florida tend to be somewhat more Republican-leaning than Hispanic voters nationwide because of the state\u2019s sizeable Cuban-American population. Nationally, little public polling is available to measure the opinions of Latino voters this year and whether they differ from four years ago. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who led among Latinos during the early stages of the Democratic primary, warned on Sunday that Biden should be \"reaching out more aggressively to grassroots Latino voters.\u201d Some on Biden's team privately acknowledged he may not win over Latinos by the same margins as Clinton, although they are not conceding defeat. Senior strategist Cristobal Alex said the campaign has been pounding airwaves with Spanish-language advertising for months in addition to launching \u201cLatino leadership councils\u201d across the country. The former vice president leads Trump by 7.4 percentage points, according to an average of the latest national polling compiled\u00a0by Real Clear Politics.\u00a0That\u2019s down from 7.7 points a month ago and 8.8 points two months ago. The new average includes a new Fox News national poll released Sunday that showed Biden topping the president 51%-46% among likely voters. The Real Clear Politics average of national polling on this date four years ago showed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by 2.3 points. Clinton led Trump by 3.2 points on the eve of the general election \u2013 and ended up winning the national popular vote by 2%.

Tucker Carlson opened Monday's edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" with a discussion of the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement, describing it as the first political party that cannot be criticized without professional or personal consequences \"The media, in their relentlessly fawning coverage, usually\u00a0describe\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u00a0as an\u00a0activist group or protest\u00a0movement,\" the host said.\u00a0\"But that's deception by understatement.

            "article_content": "Former FBI director James Comey appears before Senate Judiciary Committee Former FBI director James Comey\u00a0was\u00a0grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee over exactly what he knew regarding FBI actions in the early stages of the Russia investigation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but throughout the hearing claimed ignorance of virtually every\u00a0act that was mentioned during questioning. A Justice Department Inspector General (DOJ IG) report previously found that the warrant application and subsequent renewals applications for surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page contained inaccuracies and omissions and relied on the Steele\u00a0dossier despite evidence that it was unreliable. GRAHAM GETS AGITATED WITH COMEY AS EX-FBI DIRECTOR RESISTS QUESTIONING IN SENATE HEARING Comey opted not to deliver an opening statement Wednesday but welcomed questions. Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., got right to the point and asked what efforts the FBI made to verify the dossier. \"I don't know,\" Comey said. Graham also asked what Comey knew about former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who has pleaded guilty after being accused of altering an email to say that Page was not working with the CIA despite the FBI having knowledge that Page was working with the agency. \"I know nothing of Mr. Clinesmith,\" Comey said. Comey passed blame for the warrant, claiming he only signed the certification for it, not the affidavit it was based on, but when asked who the committee should look to in terms of who was accountable for misleading the court, Comey again came up empty. First Comey\u00a0said to look at the IG report, but when pressed on whether he knew, he gave a familiar response. \"I do not,\" he said. Graham later discussed ex-spy Christopher Steele's sub-source, whom the FBI interviewed. The sub-source told the FBI that the information in the dossier was unreliable and was based on rumor. Graham noted that the sub-source was known by the FBI to be a possible Russian spy. Confronted with these details, Comey again pleaded ignorance. \"I don\u2019t remember learning anything about Steele\u2019s sources,\" he said. When asked if he knew that the FBI interviewed the sub-source in January 2017, Comey again said, \"I don't remember.\" COMEY SAYS NEW INFORMATION THAT HILLARY CLINTON DRUMMED UP RUSSIA CONTROVERSY TO VILIFY TRUMP 'DOESN'T RING A BELL' Asked again, Comey later said he did \"not\u00a0remember being told of any interview.\" When asked if he should have been told, Comey said he could not answer. Graham grew noticeably frustrated by Comey's responses. \"Was this an important case for the FBI or was this a run of the mill thing?\" he asked at one point, commenting on the lack of information Comey appeared to have. Graham also brought up a U.S. intelligence community report that included information that salacious details about Trump in the dossier came from Russian intelligence. \"Did you know that when it came out?\" Graham asked, emphasizing that parts of Steele's dossier were believed to be Russian disinformation, yet the FBI continued to rely on it anyway. Graham went on to cite false details in the dossier, such as a reference to a Russian consulate in Miami that does not exist, and a trip that Trump attorney Michael Cohen was said to have taken to Prague that has since been debunked. \"They never corrected all the misinformation in the dossier,\" Graham said.\u00a0\"It was used over and over again, and they never told the court about how unreliable it was. Is that a small thing or a big thing?\" \"Any time there are material omissions in an application\u00a0to a judge of any kind, but especially an ex parte proceeding, it's a very important issue,\" Comey said. Graham also asked Comey about the\u00a0newly declassified information\u00a0released Tuesday by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. According to the declassified information, in September 2016, U.S. intelligence officials forwarded an investigative referral on Clinton purportedly approving \u201ca plan concerning U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections\u201d in order to distract the public from her email scandal. That referral was sent to Comey and Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember getting an investigatory lead from the intelligence community? Sept. 7, 2016, U.S. intelligence officials forwarded an investigative referral to James Comey and Strzok regarding Clinton\u2019s approval of a plan [about] Trump\u2026as a means of distraction?\u201d Graham asked Comey Wednesday. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t ring any bells with me,\u201d Comey replied. Ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., downplayed the FISA problems, noting that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the launching of the Russia investigation was done properly. COMEY ADMITS \u2018I WAS WRONG\u2019 ON FISA CONDUCT, REMAINS DEFIANT ON DOSSIER IN TENSE INTERVIEW She recognized that the FBI made mistakes, but said President Trump and his supporters are using the Carter Page warrant \u201cto assert that the entire Russia investigation was corrupt.\u201d Feinstein insisted that it \u201cplayed no part in the broader Russia investigation.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., acknowledged that Wednesday\u2019s hearing was important, but claimed that the Senate has had nearly four years to enact FISA reform and that there are more pressing issues that they should be dealing with now, such as the coronavirus pandemic or even current election issues. \u201cThere is an election coming up in a few weeks,\u201d Klobuchar said,\u00a0\u201cand as Sen. Durbin has pointed out there are a lot of concerns right now about Russia. Not about what Mr. Comey was involved with that investigation years ago but what's happening right now. \"We have Director Wray himself ...\u00a0saying,\u00a0'Russia is very active in the 2020 election, primarily through what we would call malign foreign influence in an attempt to undermine Joe Biden,'\" Klobuchar said. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, brought up past discussions he and Comey had about FISA\u00a0back when Comey was first going through his confirmation process for the FBI director position. \u201cI trusted you. I believed that you would act in good faith,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhen I asked you in my office and later in committee hearings--first in your confirmation hearing and then in our subsequent oversight hearings--what you would do to help make sure that the FISA process was respected and not manipulated, you gave me your word. And having established that brief relationship with you all those years earlier, I trusted you. Lee said that now, he is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d to find that Comey\u2019s past promises now \u201cseem very insincere.\u201d Lee then commented on Comey\u2019s repeated claims that he was not aware of problematic actions or pertinent information when the probe was going on. \u201cWith all due respect you don\u2019t seem to know anything about an investigation that you ran,\u201d he said. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., however, was less frustrated with Comey\u2019s testimony than some of his colleagues, claiming that Comey\u2019s efforts to avoid accountability may be more telling than he intended. \u201cWhat you see here is that he is at pains to a avoid any accountability and to admit to what he knew,\u201d Hawley said outside the hearing, \u201cand unfortunately he's tying himself in knots.\u201d Hawley referred to moments from the hearing when Comey denied knowledge of information such as the political affiliation of Steele\u2019s research. \u201cIt's all in the record I read it back to him, so that I think is vitally important,\u201d Hawley said, hoping that there will be \u201cprosecutorial efforts\u201d taken. Graham intends to call additional witnesses to further explore the FISA process in the Russia investigation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We'll keep moving forward,\" he said. \"I'm going to call everybody\u00a0who signed the warrant application and ask them if you\u00a0knew then what you know now, would you have signed the warrant application against Carter Page. And oh, by the way, how is it possible that the people in charge seem to know nothing about egregious abuses in one of the most important cases in the history of the FBI?\" The committee has already called former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe to testify at\u00a0a hearing scheduled for October 6.

The day the site experienced the issue was also the last day residents could\u00a0register to vote for the Nov. 3 election. Voting rights groups sued and took the case to court,\u00a0claiming Secretary of State Laurel Lee's\u00a0extension to 7 p.m on Tuesday\u00a0wasn't adequate enough to offset the damage caused by the website crash. Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker grilled lawyers for the state and\u00a0estimated that\u00a0even with the extension, far\u00a0fewer Floridians applied to vote on the online system than compared to registrations in the lead-up to the 2018 midterms, according to Fox 13. \u201cNo one wants to get this right more than we do. Our website fell short of the standards that we have set for ourselves. We tried to remedy the situation,\u201d Mohammad Jazil, a lawyer for Lee, told Walker. Plaintiffs are asking that Walker extend the voting-registration deadline for two days, but he did not immediately issue a decision. One is expected later today, however. FLORIDA VOTER REGISTRATION WEBSITE EXPERIENCED OUTAGE HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE The\u00a0defendants, on the other hand, argued the plaintiff's\u00a0proposal would harm the state \"far worse than it would benefit the plaintiffs.\u201d Walker reportedly asked if the issue was so large in scope\u00a0as to warrant judicial intervention. Jazil highlighted the fact that two individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit who claimed they were unable to use the website were already registered voters,\" Fox 13 reported. \u201cWe had a deadline. It was a generally applicable, widely known deadline. We had a failure of one mechanism to meet that deadline for a portion of one day on the last day of registration,\u201d he said. Walker replied,\u00a0\u201cAre you seriously taking the position that if it\u2019s shut down for hours and 50 [thousand]\u00a0or 60 thousand people don\u2019t get to register, that\u2019s a minor thing?\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The judge also asked why the plaintiffs are asking Walker to extend the voting-registration deadline for two more days, as opposed to just one\u00a0specific block of time. \u201cWhy would you keep it open for two days?

Wade and quoted late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her confirmation hearing in 1993. \u201c\u2018The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity,\u2019\u201d Feinstein quoted Ginsburg as saying. \u201c\u2018It is a decision she must make for herself.\u2019\u201d Feinstein added that Ginsburg said that\u00a0\u201cwhen the government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a full adult human responsible for her own choices.\u201d TRUMP LOOMS LARGE ON FIRST DAY OF BARRETT HEARING AS DEMS SOUND ALARMS OVER OBAMACARE, ELECTION, CORONAVIRUS Feinstein commended Ginsburg for being \u201cforthright\u201d in talking about the issue\u00a0and urged Barrett to do the same. \u201cI do want to be forthright and answer every question. On that question, I am going to invoke Justice Kagan\u2019s description, which I think was perfectly put \u2014 she was not going to grade precedent or give it a thumbs-up or thumbs-down,\u201d Barrett responded, adding that any further response would be \u201cwrong\u201d and a \u201cviolation of the canons to do that as a sitting judge.\u201d \u201cIt signals to litigants that I may tilt one way or another in a pending case,\u201d Barrett said. But Feinstein pushed her, saying\u00a0it was \u201cdistressing not to get a straight answer.\u201d \u201cDo you agree with Justice Scalia\u2019s view that Roe was wrongly decided?\u201d Feinstein asked. \u201cI completely understand why you are asking the question, but I cannot pre-commit or say yes, I am going in with some agenda, because I am not,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI have no agenda to try to overrule Casey, I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come.\u201d Barrett was referring to a 1992 case, Casey v. Planned Parenthood, when the Supreme Court affirmed the basic ruling of Roe v. Wade, that a state is prohibited from banning most abortions. Barrett said\u00a0Roe v. Wade's and Casey\u2019s \u201ccontours could come up again\u201d and said that while she knows it is a \u201ccontentious issue\u201d and would be \u201ccomforting\u201d for her to provide an answer, she could \u201cnot commit to approaching a case any particular way.\u201d \u201cWell, that makes it difficult for me and I think other women on this committee because this is a very important case and it affects a lot of people, millions and millions of women, and you could be a very important vote,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cAnd I hoped you would say, as a person, and you understand all implications of family life \u2014 you should be proud of that, I am proud of that for you \u2014 you are going on the biggest court of this land with a problem out there that all women see, one way or another in their life\u2026and the question comes, what happens? And will this justice support a law that has a substantial precedent now?\u201d Barrett simply stated that she will \u201cobey all the rules\u201d and will apply \u201call factors\u201d relating to precedent and \u201creliance and workability.\u201d \u201cAll the standard factors,\u201d Barrett explained. \u201cAnd I promise to do that for any issue that comes up, abortion or anything else, I\u2019ll follow the law.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Feinstein responded: \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s expected. I respect you and your family\u2026but this is a very real problem out there.\u201d It's common practice for court\u00a0nominees to stay quiet about how they would rule on certain issues so as not to prejudge the cases that could come before them. So senators rely on past statements, legal writings and court opinions to understand how a nominee would rule on Roe v. Wade. Barrett, though, has faced attacks from Planned Parenthood\u00a0and women\u2019s groups who argue her nomination is a threat to women's reproductive rights. Barrett has been scrutinized by Democrats over her faith, dating back to her confirmation to the 7th U.S.\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017. During the hearing, Barrett, a Catholic mother of seven, had to assert numerous times that her faith would not influence her jurisprudence. Feinstein, during that hearing in 2017, told Barrett at the time that she was concerned over her Catholic beliefs\u00a0and particularly how she would apply them in cases involving abortion. \u201cWhy is it that so many of us on this side have this very uncomfortable feeling that dogma and law are two different things, and I think whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different,\u201d Feinstein told Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor. \u201cAnd I think in your case, professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you. And that\u2019s of concern.\u201d In the 2017 White House questionnaire\u00a0upon being appointed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett was asked if it was her view that abortion was always immoral. She didn\u2019t answer the question directly but said: \u201cIf I am confirmed (to the 7th Circuit), my views on this or any other question will have no bearing on the discharge of my duties as a judge.\u201d In a 2013 Texas Law Review article, Barrett listed fewer than 10 cases she said are widely considered \u201csuper-precedents,\u201d ones that no justice would dare reverse even if they believed they were wrongly decided. Among them was Brown vs. Board of Education, which declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. One she didn\u2019t include on the list: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that affirmed a woman\u2019s right to abortion. Scholars don\u2019t include it, she wrote, because public controversy swirling around it has never abated. Abortion and women's rights were the focus of the\u00a0bruising 2017 confirmation process after Barrett's nomination to the 7th Circuit. Others pointed to Barrett's membership of the University of Notre Dame\u2019s \u201cFaculty for Life\u201d group \u2013\u00a0and that she had signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops affirming the \u201cvalue of human life from conception to natural death.\u201d The Senate eventually confirmed her in a 55-43 vote, with three Democrats joining\u00a0the majority. Despite concerns from Democrats, Barrett, in a\u00a01998\u00a0Notre Dame Law School review article, wrote that \u201cJudges cannot \u2014 nor should they try to \u2014 align our legal system with the Church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge. They should, however, conform their own behavior to the Church's standard. Perhaps their good example will have some effect.\" And last month, despite Democrats questioning whether her religion would influence her decisions on cases should she be confirmed to the Supreme Court, upon accepting her nomination, said that: \u201cA judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Article III Project president Mike Davis weighs in on the upcoming Supreme Court battle Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden vowed that he would pass legislation to make Roe v. Wade \"the law of the land,\" protecting it from a Supreme Court that may soon be filled with a majority of conservative justices. Republicans have made it clear that despite a forced recess in the Senate due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- which has infected three senators --- they will forge ahead with confirmation of President Trump's nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. MICHELLE OBAMA MAKES PITCH FOR BIDEN, AGAINST TRUMP'S 'RACIST' POLICIES Barrett, a federal appellate judge, has faced attacks from\u00a0liberal women's groups and Planned Parenthood, who say she is a threat to women's reproductive rights. Democrats worry that if she is appointed to the Supreme Court, she will help to\u00a0roll back abortion rights as well as the Affordable Care Act. \"We don't know exactly what she will do, although the expectation is that she may very well move to overrule Roe,\"\u00a0Biden said\u00a0during a town hall event on Monday night hosted by NBC News, referring to the landmark\u00a0Supreme Court decision in 1973 that legalized abortion across the nation. \"The only responsible response to that would be to pass legislation making Roe the law of the land. That's what I would do,\" he said. Biden has held back on criticizing Barrett herself since Trump nominated her in late September following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a leader of the court's liberal wing. Biden has instead urged the Senate to hold off on confirming her to a lifetime appointment until after the November elections. AMY CONEY BARRETT HEARINGS: HERE ARE THE CORONAVIRUS PRECAUTIONS BEING TAKEN Republicans, however, have said they will begin Barrett's confirmation process on Oct. 12 despite Democrats worrying that a recent slew of coronavirus infections could pose a danger to senators and staffers appearing in person. Trump -- who is still battling with the coronavirus after returning to the White House from a brief stay at Walter Reed Military Medical Center --\u00a0lashed out at Biden for his promise to codify abortion protections. \"Wow. Joe Biden just took a more Liberal position on Roe v. Wade than Elizabeth Warren at her highest,\" Trump said on Twitter, accusing Democrats of supporting late-term abortions. \"He also wants to PACK our great United States Supreme Court. This is what the Dems will do. Remember as they try changing positions before elections end. GET OUT AND VOTE!\" Biden has so far kept mum on Supreme Court packing, an idea supported by some Democrats angry that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Republicans are pushing to fill a vacancy that opened a little more than a month before the elections when they refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nomination nine months before the 2016 vote. Republicans maintained at that time that voters should have a voice in the decision. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 91 percent of abortions in the U.S. are performed within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy and only 1.4 percent occur at or after 21 weeks.

Democrats may have been thrilled with their four-night, largely virtual convention, but Republicans backing President Trump didn't appear very impressed. The Democratic Convention\u00a0was a \"socialist snoozefest,\" Boris Epshteyn, a\u00a0Trump 2020 Campaign\u00a0strategic adviser, quipped after the event concluded Thursday evening. \"It was terrible,\" Epshteyn added on the Trump campaign's convention recap show \"The Real Joe Biden.\" \"The first night was boring, the second night was a bunch of losers like John Kerry, last night was retreads like Hillary Clinton \u2026 and tonight was supposed to be the big night. \u2026 Is this the worst major party convention in our lifetimes?\u201d DANA PERINO PRAISES BIDEN'S DNC ACCEPTANCE SPEECH AS A 'HOME RUN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH' U.S. Rep.

Stefanik said voters were looking for \u201cstrong leadership,\u201d which they see in Trump over Biden, adding that Trump has traveled more miles campaigning this week than Biden has his entire campaign. She said he\u2019s the \u201cswamp\u201d that Trump is trying to beat.

Pierson said minority voters won\u2019t be fooled by Biden, claiming he is still \u201cexuding racism out of his mouth,\" and Stefanik agreed, stating that no president has done more to combat anti-Semitism than Trump.

What I'm interested in is saving Americans from socialism. That means putting American policies first, and that means stopping the radical left, and their Democrat socialist policies that they want to pass\u00a0that would wreck our economy, kill our jobs and take away our freedoms. Those are the things I'm working on.\" But the candidate has been called to confront other past statements, including once saying there's no evidence a plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11. Recently, Greene\u00a0admitted on Twitter that the 9/11 conspiracy theory\u00a0was \"not correct.\" Asked whether there were other past statements or theories that she'd like to correct, Greene said her videos were designed to question topics and she's most focused on getting to work for her district. \"A lot of the things I talked about were things that people were questioning. So oftentimes, in these videos, I was talking about these topics and in ways of just discussing them,\" Greene said. \"I'm one of those people --\u00a0I have no problem talking about an issue, asking questions and bringing things up.\" Politico reported\u00a0that in Facebook Live videos, Greene also suggested that Muslims do not belong in government; thinks Black people \u201care held slaves to the Democratic Party\u201d; called George Soros, a Jewish Democratic megadonor, a Nazi; and said she would feel \u201cproud\u201d to see a Confederate monument if she were Black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War. Greene said those \u201clittle sound bites\u201d from past videos were \u201cnot my full explanation\u201d and were \u201cchosen to try to create a narrative about me that's not true.\u201d Some GOP leaders condemned Greene earlier in the campaign for such\u00a0past unearthed statements. Greene said that since she's\u00a0won the primary she's had \"great conversations with Kevin McCarthy\u00a0and many other leaders in Congress.\" Most notably,\u00a0she's gotten support from Trump, who called her on election night to congratulate her and later tweeted that she's a \"future Republican star.\" While Greene on Friday distanced herself from \"Q,\" Trump declined to answer a question about his views on\u00a0QAnon during a White House briefing. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE WINS GOP NOD IN GEORGIA \"She won by a lot,\" Trump said of Greene's primary win Tuesday.\u00a0\"She was very popular. She comes from a great state. She had a tremendous victory so absolutely I did congratulate her.\" Greene laid out\u00a0some of her priorities for Congress:\u00a0stopping socialism, defunding Planned Parenthood,\u00a0protecting law enforcement, declaring Antifa a domestic terrorist group, and tackling the massive debt. \"I will be a very proud conservative American woman\u00a0and I will be fighting back against the squad,\" Greene said of the group of progressive freshman lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. \"They need to be stopped. These are radical women who\u00a0have embraced socialism and some of them even communism, and they are trying to tear down our country.\" GOP PRIMARY WINNER CALLS OUT PELOSI: 'KICK THAT BI--- OUT OF CONGRESS' Greene had a memorable victory night speech Tuesday when she called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a derogatory term for women. Democrats have demanded Greene apologize, but she refused. \"Yes, I did mean it when I said I wanted to kick that b----\u00a0out of Congress,\" Greene said. \"I know that's not a nice word, but impeaching an innocent president is also not a nice thing to do.\" Greene will face Democrat Kevin Van Ausdal on the November ballot and is widely expected to win in the safe Republican district.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" August 25, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingram and this is \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d from Washington tonight. All right. Day two of the RNC is history. And once again, we've seen a contrast between the party that believes in Liberty, the GOP, and one that believes in lockdown, the Democrats. For months, we've heard Democrats and a few wimpy Republicans claim that because of this virus, we all have to get used to a new normal. But I don't think they anticipated that there were tens of millions of Americans who liked the old normal, thank you very much and aren't about to lie down to let you take it away from us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON JOYCE, EIGHTH-GENERATION LOBSTERMAN: The Obama-Biden era banking regulations left us no choice and it drives us of the lifeblood of our business. And then everything changed. Donald Trump was elected president. He knew what it was like to build a company and create jobs. CRIS PETERSON, DAIRY FARMER: Support and focus on negotiating new trade deals. Gave us the confidence to rebuild our barn and dairy operation. ROBERT VLAISAVLJEVICH, EVELETH, MINNESOTA MAYOR: The straight-talking New Yorker burst onto the scene promising to stand up to China and the rest of the world on behalf of the American worker. Four years later, the iron Rangers roaring back to life. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And then there were stories of redemption, something all of us need, no matter who we are or where we come from. And guess what? President Trump's commitment to second chances is something of course, the media, they're never going to acknowledge, as police are demonized, and unrepentant criminals roam free. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he stood there in that graduation, and he went out of his way to shake the hand of every one of those 29 graduates, set them on a whole another (INAUDIBLE) because they had the Office of the President of the United States. The promises that he made was promises that he kept. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So now I'd like to invite John's wife Jamie to join us as I grant, John, I'm not sure you know this, a full pardon (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Again, this didn't fit the media's malicious narrative about President Trump. And that, by the way, doesn't even take into account that powerful speech you just heard from Melania Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I also asked people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice. And never make assumptions based on the color of a person's skin. Instead of tearings things -- tearing things down, let's reflect on our mistakes. Be proud of our evolution, and look to our way forward. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: The future while we learn from the past. Joining me now Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, Sara Carter, Fox News contributor the host of the Sarah Carter Show podcast and Harmeet Dhillon, lawyers for Trump national co-chair, founder of the Center for American liberty. Sarah now, this was a tough night for the folks who consider Mellania to be, you know, free Milan, remember all those t-shirts people were selling? HARMEET DHILLON, FOUNDER, THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN LIBERTY: Right. INGRAHAM: That speech by Melania was a complete and total home run on every front. DHILLON: Oh, she's absolutely remarkable. It was a speech that not only touched my heart as the wife of a wounded veteran, but it touched the hearts of people all across this country. She focused on the families who have lost loved ones from COVID. She focused on those who have died of opioid addiction and how the COVID crisis and lockdown has seen a surge. We've seen a surge in in suicide rates in opioid addiction. She spoke directly to those families of veterans and she spoke to children. She said, you know, it is our duty, it is as adults to be there for these children for children all over the world. I was -- I was struck, Laura, by one thing over the last two nights I feel this is a Republican reawakening. It is a reawakening in our nation on freedom and the principles that we stand on, not by the color of our skin, not by anything but by the American people. By our small business leaders, by women, by minorities. Senator Tim Scott, what we saw tonight with Attorney General of Kentucky, Cameron, and how he spoke out. Nikki Haley, his family. What we're seeing here is what America's really about, not what the DNC showed last week and I think we can feel proud and confident moving forward, MACCALLUM: The incredibly diverse group of Americans speaking, sharing their own personal stories and their commitment to this president for what he's done, not because of the person he is but because of the results he was able to achieve. And Harmeet, another -- I think, very interesting moment from Melania tonight. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I don't want to use this precious time attacking the other side. Because as we saw last week, that kind of talk only serves to divide the country further. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Harmeet, bouncing around the internet, was that Melania taking - - a glancing, -- not a blow but a little brush away of Michelle or others? DHILLON: Well, I think so. But Melania has always been known for her grace and class and rising above and focusing on what she's chosen to focus on. And she did an amazing job tonight. I'm a first-generation immigrant, my mom studied for an exam like that, and I was sworn in and naturalized as well. And I remember that and so that really spoke to millions of Americans as well. And all of us are so proud to see that somebody like that can be in the White House giving that kind of a speech. So, she really rose above the partisan nastiness even as she was speaking, we see the nasty vitriol pouring out on Twitter because the left has nothing nice to say and can't acknowledge her amazing moment. But, you know, this was true class that she has led from. MACCALLUM: And Victor, the other powerful speech of the night I think, was the just referenced by Sarah, this speech by a rising star in the Republican Party. No doubt about it. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL CAMERON ATTORNEY GENERAL OF KENTUCKY: Our first Republican President believed in compassion, self-reliance, freedom, equality, and justice. Sadly, there are some who don't believe in this wisdom or in the better angels of our shared American history. As they tear down the statues of people like Ulysses S. Grant, Frederick Douglass, and even Mr. Lincoln himself. Lincoln said any nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure. And for Republicans, our heroes are those who propelled an imperfect nation ever forward. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Victor, how significant a moment or is that tonight? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: I think it was a lot more impressive than Barack Obama's 2004 convince convention speak that propelled him to the presidency. Four years later was quite stunning. And when you book in that, with Senator Scott's last night, it was really impressive because they were saying we don't -- we don't need you to tell us what to think. We're more than capable, were the stars of this party. Laura, this is not the party of John McCain and Mitt Romney anymore. They would never have a convention when people were talking about the opioid crisis or workers in the Midwest, or they need to confront China or hit the immigration challenge head on say these are wonderful immigrants. We're for illegal immigration. It's not illegal immigration. That's a different subject And so, it's a very different party. It's more of a populace workers party and when -- they didn't get -- I'm for capital gains reduction (INAUDIBLE) privatizing Social Security. But those aren't the issues today. And they're not talking about those things. That's an elite aristocratic party. This is more of a working party. The other thing is that I know there was criticism of Donald Trump, but he was ubiquitous. His presence is everywhere. He's energy in motion. And when you look in that are contrasted with Joe Biden. And he's not really, he's a virtual candidate in a virtual campaign in a virtual election. He's not really there anymore. There is no there there for Joe Biden, and Trump is trying to emphasize it. Whatever you think of him, he doesn't sleep. He's in motion. He's orchestrating everything, and it makes it strong -- makes a strong parallel, I think. And then finally, this was an upbeat idea that we're going to -- 2020 is an awful year, locked down, COVID. MACCALLUM: Right. HANSON: Possible recession, but that's something like the Great Depression or the Civil War, World War. That's something we get through. It's not a window into our dark soul that we were flawed at the origins. And that's the message we got from the Democratic Party. This see we told you, we were always like this and now and now you revealed America that really didn't find -- wasn't founded in 1776, but 1619 or some (INAUDIBLE) So it was very different the view of America, MACCALLUM: You will not hear this analysis anywhere else tonight. Everybody watching this right now. What Victor Davis Hanson just said, Sarah and Harmee,. their thoughts on this. This is not the party of George W. Bush, no offense to him, but it is a different Republican Party. It is focused on these issues that conservatives do care about a lot. And we're going to get into the small business owners, the lobsterman in Maine in just a moment because I think that's getting overlooked tonight. That was an important moment. But Sarah, I have to play this what Victor said these people would not be showcased as they were tonight by previous administrations or previous candidates. But Abby Johnson, formerly with Planned Parenthood. Tonight, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBY JOHNSON, PLANNED PARENTHOOD DIRECTOR: I spent eight years working for Planned Parenthood, my supervisor assigned me a new quota to meet, an abortion quota. An unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the section. And I'll never forget what the doctor said next. Beam me up, Scotty. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Wow. Sara, just took your breath away. You think of the standing ovation in the New York State Assembly for late-term abortion. You think of Ralph Northam saying, the governor of Virginia saying, oh, we'll keep them comfortable if the baby's born alive. And then you heard her testimony. Would the Bush's or Mitt Romney have given such a prominent platform to that message, Sara? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: No, they would not. And that's Why Laura, I said at the beginning, this is a republican reawakening. This is a new party. This is a party that cares about the American people, about the American worker, about the principles and the values of life. That is drastically different than the Republican Party that was hijacked for so long, by the Bush's, by the McCain's, by others. They didn't focus in on these issues of the American worker, the American people, the right to life. Here's the first president, the first president who has stood up and stood up proudly for the right to life for our children that are dying. And the first president that has pointed out, that has pointed out that children have been dying by the thousands, particularly in minority communities from abortion. I think that we need to stop being so silent and I think that the first -- these first two days of convention that this idea of silent majority no longer exists. I feel Americans are unsilent now and we're just -- we're being able to speak out and move forward. MACCALLUM: (INAUDIBLE) the silent thing has got to at this point. Harmeet, really quickly. I'm from New England. I got a lot of friends in Maine watching the lobster man, the lobster guy, we got to watch him play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOYCE: I have to confess. I didn't support Trump in 2016, skeptical that he shared my conservative views. I expected him to flip flop on this campaign promises. When he sees something isn't right. He's fearless and fixing it. He listens to working people. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: He listens to working people, Harmeet. Getting those tariffs lifted from the Europeans on the main lobster industry. It seems like just, you know, a small issue, but not to that Swan Island. It's not a small issue to them. DHILLON: Absolutely. Laura, as others have said tonight, this is a different Republican Party. I've been part of that party for decades now. And I can tell you that we had a death struggle at the convention four years ago. And yesterday when we -- when we did our nomination, it was smooth as silk. This is the new party and it's an energetic party. It's a different party. And I'm really excited to see this already grow and see stars like Daniel Cameron and others become the leaders of this party in the future. MACCALLUM: Good stuff, panel. Thank you all so much. And this November, we should stop this nonsense once and for all. No gang of thugs should ever be allowed to burn American buildings, destroy our history, or threaten American citizens. But you all should be able to go to a restaurant without some punk getting an inch from your face screaming demands, whatever the demands. The Democrats do have big plans for America, which are going to force you all to your knees, begging for government help. Maybe you'll try to call the police but they won't be there anymore. All you want is to live your life in freedom and safety. But until the Democrats stop and delve, the left's obsession with socialism, violence, intimidation and you bet intolerance, they cannot be trusted to govern this country. Joining me now, Rudy Giuliani, Former New York City Mayor. Rudy -- Kenosha, Wisconsin, another democrat city being put to the torch by Black Lives Matter-inspired protesters. They're not protesters. These people are criminals who are lighting, businesses on fire. You see people crying in tears. This would not have happened in a city that you were mayor of, or if Scott Walker was still Governor of Wisconsin, I don't think it would be happening. What are Democrat officials doing tonight to stop this? RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: They are pandering to, to whatever is their conception of the base of their party. They're frightened, they're afraid. The image of Democratic officials bending their knee to Black Lives Matter is a very, very powerful image and it's correct. I can't think of a single democratic mayor or governor that's taken this on. I mean, their cities are being destroyed. New York is being destroyed. Portland is being destroyed. Chicago has been destroyed for the last 10 years. I mean, you just don't have a city when you have 70 or 80 shootings a weekend. And these are all democrat cities. Philadelphia has become number two in murders in the country. Baltimore. Unbelievable. I interviewed Kimberly (INAUDIBLE) -- INGRAHAM: Klacik. Klacik, yes. GUILIANI: Klacik, rather. And we went over -- we went over the crime statistics in Baltimore. I forgotten how bad it is in Baltimore. These are all Democrat cities because of Democrat policies. I know that because I took over a Democrat City, and I reversed the policies in 30 years. And the problem with this is if you let it go too far, New York City got to 1000 murders in 1968. It took 30 years to get below that and we went way up to 2400. So, you let this go too long, it's going to set in and it's beginning to go to the suburbs. The confrontation with the McCloskeys is in the suburbs. The last three nights in Portland, they've moved out into the suburbs. So, they come in, and it's in their plan to do that. So, I really think this is a critical election, in terms of is this country going to go back to high crime, tremendous violence, challenging who we are and what we are, trying to destroy our way of life, or are we going to make reaffirmation of who we are as Americans in a new way, a new generation. I agree with your panelists. I think the speakers tonight and last night -- I remember last night, you know, Vernon Jones, and Kimberly, and now, tonight, and Senator Scott Cameron tonight, and then remarkably young people, Natalie Hart. Just think of all the young people that we have in our party. All you saw in their party of people that have been in office, you know, Pelosi has been in office since before George Washington. And I mean it's, it's ridiculous they got a bunch of people who are worn out, out there. They don't even have their own solutions anymore. They've gone to Socialism. INGRAHAM: Now, and I think Rudy, you you're touching -- you touched on it. I mean, the invective and the demonization of police and the demonization of Trump. You, Fox News, whatever it is, it's never solutions. It's always demonization. Rudy, thank you so much for your analysis. Thank you always. And you know, those roving mobs that are terrorizing the country that the media, they pretend they don't exist, right? Well, the voters are watching, but they're not buying what the media is hiding from them. They see what's really going on. Next, we talked to a Kenosha, Wisconsin man whose friend was beaten and whose charity destroyed by BLM anarchists just last night, stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The RNC so far has made it pretty clear the sort of chaos that's going to be rewarded if Biden should win in November. Well, what does that mean? The latest manifestation of all of this is in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Black Lives Matter anarchists aren't just targeting businesses, they're now targeting and I kid you not, charities. Rioters burned down a lodge belonging to the Danish Brotherhood Charitable Group, but not before one of the Brotherhood's members was brutally beaten trying to defend it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, hey! No, no, no! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let him go! No! No! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Here to respond to that horrific attack is Robert Nelson, Kenosha Resident and Former Danish Brothers Lodge President. Robert, thank you for joining us. We had such a positive night here at the RNC Night Two, but people have to see what's going on there. We got to know how is the brother who was beaten? Is he doing OK tonight? ROBERT NELSON, FORMER PRESIDENT FOR DANISH BROTHERS LODGE: He is doing much better. So, I got a word this morning that he was in surgery last night. His head was stitched up and he is feistier than ever, from what some of his friends have been saying and some other brotherhood members. He was actually back down there by the mattress shop early this morning after he was discharged from the hospital, and he's back in action. INGRAHAM: Hey, Robert, I'm looking at live pictures just so everyone understands what we're seeing on screen. Live pictures of Kenosha tonight. Given what happened last night, I mean, I don't know, is there a curfew? Should -- shouldn't there be a curfew? What on earth is happening in beautiful Wisconsin? NELSON: This has been the third straight night we've had a curfew, beginning at 8:00 p.m. Not that it's been rigidly enforced. You see people constantly leaving their homes, driving around chaotically. A lot of pedestrians in the street. It's just been a chaotic scene for the last three nights since this often involves shooting. INGRAHAM: Yes, since, since black man was again, shot at the hands of a police officer, and again, the video looks horrific. And the more information is coming in, but Tony Evers, your Governor, we learned from Mark Meadows a tweet about Mark Meadows, the Chief Staff of the White House, he declined the White House's offer of federal assistance to come in and try to calm things down there. Your reaction to that very quickly. NELSON: That's really, that's not really surprising to me. He's been slow to react to just about every emergency we've had this year. There's plenty of residents, especially in Kenosha at this time that are definitely -- they're very much disappointed to him. I know some pretty ardent Democrats that even mentioned that they would never, never support him again in any election. INGRAHAM: I can't imagine. Robert, I just cannot believe that he would get elected to dog catcher after what's happened. Robert, we'll be watching this. Stay safe there, my friend. NELSON: Thank you. INGRAHAM: And after days of violence in Wisconsin, the Biden campaign finally issued a statement condemning the (INAUDIBLE) destruction there, but why hasn't Biden himself come out on T.V. or film the statement right to camera from his basement if he has to do it against this? It's been happening all over the country. And not doing this, not having a clear statement puts lives at risk. Congressman Steve Scalise joins me now, also with me, Raymond Arroyo Fox News Contributor. All right, Congressman, you've seen firsthand what ignoring violent actions can lead to. Your reaction tonight seeing these pictures. REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA: You know, Laura, continues to be disturbing when you see some of these mayors let their cities be overrun by mobs and people that want to just burn the city down. Again, that is not a peaceful protest, despite what some in the media want to say. I mean, there's a way to protest. And then there's people that just have no respect for, for others or for personal property. And, and the fact that some of these democrat mayors continue to let their own cities be burned down. For goodness sake, I mean, this is something that President Trump doesn't tolerate. Joe Biden sits on the sidelines. They never addressed this at the Democratic Convention last week, because they're afraid to stand up to these mobs. And, like I think most people are fed up with that. It's got to end and at least we've got a president who actually respects safety and security of people that want to, you know, want to just make sure that they can be safe in their own homes. INGRAHAM: And Raymond, what else wasn't discussed today? I mean, where was Biden, where was -- what was he doing right now? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Where is he? Where is Biden? Look, he's like the Loch Ness Monster, you rarely see him. He's out there somewhere at their spottings today. There was only one pool report, it said that Biden was out riding his bike. We've seen that earlier in the month. This time he had a helmet on that was the big news of the day. There's nothing being said. The beautiful thing about what we saw tonight, maybe groundbreaking was a familiarity and comfort with faith that ran from the Jon Voight film cleared through to John Ponder, the man who reformed his life after prison right through the end with Melania Trump. A comfort with faith and the linking that to tradition and heritage and protecting your city and the statues and the things that you reflect what we love about America. That was at the heart of tonight's man. INGRAHAM: One of the things that I know is going to get lost in the shuffle is when Melania said, this building means a lot, the history of this place, for the next, for the next whoever it is, the next presidents to come and families that live here and all the people because it's their house. Now, Michelle said it's the people's house too, but the fact that she made that point now. ARROYO: Well, she's getting wrapped for restoring the Rose Garden that she spoken tonight. It's the first time it's been done over in 60 years, and she restored it to its original historical -- INGRAHAM: What private donation (INAUDIBLE) -- ARROYO: So, I think it was, that was a tip of the hat to that. She did a lot of little subtle correcting of the record, which given the media environment, given the, the hostile politics of the moment. It was the right tone. She did it elegantly. And I think she chose the right, the right moment to slip it in. INGRAHAM: Steve Scalise much was said earlier in the show about how this is a new Republican Party. This is cemented in a more populist conservatism. Do you agree with that? SCALISE: I do. I mean, look, what you're seeing is, is the, you know, those of us that have been speaking in the message in general, has been just boldly embracing what conservatism is, you know, in the Ronald Reagan era of being proud to be a conservative and fighting for the values and belief of this country. Look, Melania Trump fled communism and socialism. God help us if they try to bring that here. You know, she left a country like so many others did, to come to a place where freedom is cherished. And there's some people that want to take those freedoms away. That's what this election is about in November. We've got to talk about it. The fact that they literally want to kill a baby who's born alive outside the womb and call it abortion. It's murder, Laura, and that's what the Born Alive Act is about. And by the way, almost every single Democrat in Congress has voted to allow that baby to be murdered. I mean, that's where their party is. They're no longer the party that wants abortion to be rare but legal. They literally want taxpayer funding of abortion on demand, including when the baby's born alive. Their party is not anything like your grandfather or your father, or Joe Biden's Democratic Party. INGRAHAM: Previous Republican conventions kind of did a passing nod to the pro-life issue, not this one. No, this is full throated pro-life. Gentlemen, thank you so much. Sorry, it's so short tonight. And the speeches have been a testament to how successful the Trump team has been at telling the American story and if they keep it up, it could make a huge difference in November. Horace Cooper and Niger Innis are here to explain why next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Our next guest say that the last two nights of the RNC show that Trump can make up a potential deficit with white educated Americans with a new set of voters. Horace Cooper, Project 21, Co-Chair, Author of \"How Trump is Making Black AMERICA Great Again,\" and Niger Innis, Chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality. Niger, explain why you think there is that potential for Donald Trump? NIGER INNIS, CHAIRMAN, CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY: Well, before the COVID crisis, there was some polls showing that Trump could get as high as 30 percent of the black vote. Now, I think that was a little, little far- fetched. But I think the fact that he could double his percentage from eight to 15 percent, that is very much within the realm of possibility with the type of convention and the type of efforts that he's making in the African American community. That Ponder moment, when Ponder got pardoned and started to break down and cry. That is -- it has so much resonance in urban America all across the country. So, I do think that the black Hispanic gains that Trump is going to make is going to offset the loss with white educated voters, if indeed there is one. INGRAHAM: Horace, we had. Senator Scott yesterday, we had the Attorney General of Kentucky tonight. We had a very diverse group of Americans just speaking from the heart about their own experiences. Does this diversity bust the media narrative about the GOP as a white-only party? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Well, absolutely it does. And it's precisely because in a nation of more than 300 million people, it's easy to get millions of excited people who happen to be black. Now, I actually am a lot more excited about the prospects coming into this election than my good friend, Niger. I think we are on track to see record-breaking levels of support and that's because of school choice. That's because of pro-life, that's because people love the idea of a president standing up for hardworking Americans. That's good with blacks, whites and browns. INGRAHAM: And Niger -- INNIS: I would love to; I would love to be wrong. INGRAHAM: And Nigel, you got 15 seconds here, one to 10, how do these riots affect the African American vote by, by one to 10, 10 being a lot pro-Trump? INNIS: How's 14 for you? INGRAHAM: All right, and that, that makes the point. INNIS: Oh, absolutely -- INGRAHAM: Both of you, thank you. Sorry, so short tonight, but we'll have you back soon. The speaker that you know CNN really hated having to take, the last bite explains. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Remember how the Covington kids were smeared by the media? Well, Nick Sandmann made an appearance at the RNC tonight to say this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICK SANDMANN, COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: The media portrayed me as an aggressor with a relentless smirk on my face. The truth was not important. Advancing their anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered. And if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of the teenager from Covington, Kentucky, well, so be it.

            "article_content": "Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., presses Judge Amy Coney Barrett on her stance on Roe v Wade in Senate confirmation hearing. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett cited the woman she could be replacing on the high court on Tuesday, when Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats pressed her for her opinion on\u00a0hot-button issues. In one exchange, Barrett invoked the \"Ginsburg Rule\"\u00a0when Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked during Barrett's confirmation hearing if she agrees with the late Justice Antonin Scalia's view that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to gay marriage. BARRETT ADMITS TO OWNING A GUN, SAYS SHE CAN SET ASIDE BELIEFS TO RULE ON 2ND AMENDMENT FAIRLY \"I'm not going to express a view on whether I agree or disagree with Justice Scalia for the same reasons that I've been giving,\" Barrett said. \"Justice Ginsburg with her characteristic pithiness used this to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing: no hints, no previews, no forecasts. That has been the practice of nominees before her, but everybody calls it the 'Ginsburg Rule'\u00a0because she stated it so concisely and it\u2019s been the practice of every nominee since.\" Barrett also reminded Feinstein of what she told Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., earlier in the day about how she and Scalia are two different people despite having a shared philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody should assume that just because Justice Scalia decided a decision a certain way that I would too,\u201d she said. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett speaks during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2020. (Tom Williams/Pool via AP) At another point in the hearing, Barrett also referenced Ginsburg when Feinstein asked if she agreed with Scalia's view that Roe v. Wade was decided incorrectly. \"Senator, I completely understand why you are asking the question, but again, I can't pre-commit or say, 'Yes, I'm going in with some agenda,' because I'm not,\" she said. Meanwhile, Feinstein\u00a0asked Barrett to be forthright about her views on abortion and Roe v. Wade and tried to drill down on Barrett's stances on a number of issues. \"I do want to be forthright and answer every question so far as I can,\" Barrett said, citing Justice Elena Kagan's confirmation hearing. \"She said that she was not going to grade precedent or give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.\" BARRETT SAYS SHE KNEW 'FAITH WOULD BE CARICATURED,' 'FAMILY WOULD BE ATTACKED' IF NOMINATED TO SUPREME COURT \"It\u00a0would actually be wrong and in violation of the cannons for me\u00a0to do that as a sitting judge,\" Barrett added. Feinstein shot back: \"On something that is really a major cause with major effect on half of the population of this country, it's distressing not to get a straight answer.\" Barrett responded that she understood the question, but could not \"pre-commit\" to a certain view on Roe v. Wade or its progeny Planned Parenthood v. Casey. As Feinstein continued to ask Barrett if she agreed with certain statements on precedent, Barrett continued to refuse to give answers committing to a certain outcome of a case. Barrett did add that she would follow the principles of \"stare decisis,\" which is the concept that the court will defer to past decisions in most cases, depending on a complex confluence of factors. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., brought up Democrats calls for Barrett to recuse herself specifically from any election-related cases.\u00a0\"He's counting on you to deliver him the election,\" Leahy said, noting comments by the president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Barrett said that she would not be able to make any commitment on recusing herself until a case came before her, citing Ginsburg's past description of when a justice should recuse herself. Barrett also avoided making commitments when Feinstein asked her to weigh in on California v. Texas, the Supreme Court case set to be argued on Nov. 10 that could overturn the ACA. Barrett refused to talk about the case except to say it had to do with the concept of \"severability.\" When a court decides a part of a law is unconstitutional and must be overturned, it then decides whether the rest of the law can stand without that part, or if the entire law must fall because the unconstitutional part was too central to its purposes.

Meanwhile, [Donald] Trump, [Joe] Biden and their supporters could offer competing claims of victory or question the election\u2019s legitimacy, inflaming an already boiling electorate. \u2026 At Trump\u2019s campaign headquarters, senior counsel Justin Clark blamed Georgia\u2019s vote-by-mail push amid the COVID-19 pandemic, alluding to the president\u2019s unfounded claims that absentee voting yields widespread fraud. \u2026\u00a0Rachana Desai Martin, a Biden campaign attorney, called the scenes in Georgia a \u2018threat\u2019 to democracy. \u2018We only have a few months left until voters around the nation head to the polls again, and efforts should begin immediately to ensure that every Georgian \u2014 and every American \u2014 is able to safely exercise their right to vote,\u2019 she said.\u201dNevada struggling, too -\u00a0Politico: \u201cVote counting stretched late into the night in Georgia and Nevada on Tuesday, after both states grappled with long lines for in-person voting and a surge of mail ballots that slowed the tabulation process. The contests on the ballot included nationally watched races for Senate and House, and Wednesday dawned with many of the top contests unresolved. In both states, voters reported lines in excess of four hours, and several counties in Georgia sought emergency judicial orders to keep their polling places open for hours after the original 7 p.m. closing time because of the lines and technical glitches. The voting issues and delays in reporting results provided a potential preview of the November general election under pandemic rules: polling places closed and consolidated because of a lack of staff, restrictions on occupancy to comply with social distancing rules and multi-fold increases in the number of voters casting absentee ballots that must be verified.\u201dOssoff runoff? -\u00a0AJC: \u201cJon Ossoff\u00a0built a commanding lead in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate on Tuesday as polls began to close after a day of voting marred by long lines and faulty equipment, but it was not yet clear whether he would face a runoff. The former congressional candidate had a double-digit edge in the race to challenge Republican U.S. Sen.\u00a0David Perdue, and results through early Wednesday showed him hovering just below the majority-vote mark he needs to avoid an August runoff. Yet a head-to-head matchup against either one of his well-financed opponents -- executive\u00a0Sarah Riggs Amico\u00a0and former Columbus Mayor\u00a0Teresa Tomlinson\u00a0-- remained a possibility as returns trickled in. The primary was plagued by serious problems, with many precincts struggling with missing or malfunctioning voting machines, part of a $104 million system the state purchased after a ballot access fight during the 2018 gubernatorial election.\u201dTHE RULEBOOK: DANKE DEUTSCHLAND\u201cHistory gives us a horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated Germany prior to the institution of the Imperial Chamber by\u00a0Maximilian, towards the close of the fifteenth century; and informs us, at the same time, of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the tranquillity of the empire.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 80TIME OUT: OUT OF THIS WORLDNPR: \u201cKathy Sullivan\u00a0has seen her share of highs and lows. Sullivan, the first U.S. woman to walk in space, a veteran of three shuttle missions and an enshrined member of the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, took a perilous journey downward this week. She became the first woman to reach Challenger Deep, the deepest known point on Earth, in the South Pacific. On Monday, shortly after completing the expedition in their submersible, Sullivan and her fellow diver\u00a0Victor Vescovo\u00a0\u2014 who was already one of just a handful of people in the world to reach Challenger Deep \u2014 coordinated a call with the International Space Station. \u2018As a hybrid oceanographer and astronaut this was an extraordinary day, a once in a lifetime day,\u2019 she said in a statement released by EYOS Expeditions, which supported the expedition. \u2026 All told, EYOS Expeditions said that just seven people had reached the point before Sullivan, all of whom were men.\u201dFlag on the play?\u00a0- Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\u00a0\u00a0NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE\u00a0Trump:\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0Biden:\u00a050.2 percent\u00a0Size of lead:\u00a0Biden by 8.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0First week of average[Average includes: CNN: Trump 41% - Biden 55%; NBC News/WSJ: Trump 42% - Biden 49%; NPR/PBS/Marist: Trump 43% - Biden 50%; IBD: Trump 42% - Biden 49%; Monmouth University: Trump 41% - Biden 52%.]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(186 electoral votes)\u00a0Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(249 electoral votes)[Full rankings\u00a0here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\u00a040.6 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a055 percentNet Score:\u00a0-14.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2193\u00a03 points[Average includes: CNN: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; NPR/PBS: 42% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 42% approve - 52% disapprove; Gallup: 39% approve - 57% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 54% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Multiple GOP officials confirmed to Fox News that the northern Florida city is considered \u2018a strong contender.\u2019 But those same Republican Party officials caution that the search is ongoing and remains fluid. Other possibilities include Savannah, Ga.; Nashville, Tenn.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Dallas, Texas. \u2018We are still considering several cities and no final decision has been made,\u2019 a Republican source familiar with convention discussions told Fox News on Wednesday. The Washington Post \u2013 citing three Republican officials \u2013 reported early Wednesday that the party had tentatively settled on Jacksonville to host the convention\u2019s festivities. They added that party officials were in the city and surrounding locations on Monday. Multiple GOP sources told Fox News the report was premature.\u201dRepublicans flee from Trump\u2019s claim of conspiracy in police attack -\u00a0Politico: \u201cIf there was ever a tweet from President Donald Trump that Senate Republicans didn\u2019t want to touch, it\u2019s this one. For four years, Senate Republicans have endured a regular gantlet of reporters\u2019 questions about Trump tweets, ranging from attacks on their own colleagues to telling a handful of congresswomen of color to \u2018go back\u2019 to the countries they came from. Trump\u2019s tweet Tuesday morning attacking a 75-year old protester in Buffalo \u2014 who was shoved by the police and bled from his head after falling \u2014 stunned some in a caucus that\u2019s grown used to the president\u2019s active Twitter feed. After examining a print-out of the tweet, Sen.\u00a0Lisa Murkowski\u00a0gasped: \u2018oh lord, Ugh.\u2019 \u2026 But though the moderate Murkowski was nearly rendered speechless, the missive mostly failed to get a rise out of Senate Republicans. Many know Trump will tweet something else soon they will be asked to respond to, even if the Buffalo tweet seemed a new frontier for Trump\u2019s insult-laden social media persona.\u201dFORMER DNC BOSS: BIDEN BETTER OFF \u2018IN THE BASEMENT\u2019Fox News: \u201cTop Joe Biden surrogate\u00a0Terry McAuliffe\u00a0told a videoconference meeting of Virginia Democrats over the weekend that the former vice president should remain in his basement -- where he has famously campaigned remotely during the coronavirus pandemic -- and that Democratic officials are broadly \u2018preferring\u2019 that Biden stay out of the limelight. Fox News has obtained a video of McAuliffe's Norfolk comments, which came after Biden has made a series of gaffes in his already-limited public appearances as he social distanced from home -- including by declaring that African-Americans who support President Trump \u2018ain\u2019t black.\u2019 \u2018People say all the time, \u2018Oh, we got to get the vice president out of the basement,\u2019\u2019 McAuliffe told the \u2018monthly breakfast\u2019 of the Norfolk City Democratic Committee. \u2018He's fine in the basement. Two people see him a day: his two body people. That's it. Let Trump keep doing what Trump's doing.\u2019\u201dDems take edge in Iowa voter rolls -\u00a0Politico: \u201cIowa, once a model swing state, fell so hard for Donald Trump four years ago that 2020 seemed like a foregone conclusion. But in a sign of how Trump\u2019s reelection prospects have weakened across the country, even the heartland may be having second thoughts. Since the start of the year, Democrats in Iowa have added about twice as many active voters to their rolls as Republicans, nudging ahead in total registration for the first time in years. The farm economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. And though Trump still holds a small lead in the state, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, he\u2019s now airing TV advertisements there \u2014 a tacit acknowledgment that the campaign anticipates a contest. \u2018We were approaching \u2018done\u2019 status \u2014 stick a fork in us,\u2019\u00a0Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said of the party\u2019s status after the 2016 election. Now, she said, \u2018the worm is turning.\u2019\u201dSCOTT STANDS UP ON POLICE LEGISLATIONPolitico: \u201cCongressional Republicans are under pressure for perhaps the first time in decades to make a serious effort at police reform. But don\u2019t expect them to take the plunge without President Donald Trump. Sen.\u00a0Tim Scott\u00a0of South Carolina \u2014 the lone black Republican in the Senate \u2014 briefed his colleagues Tuesday on ways to improve policing just a few hours after Trump suggested an elderly Buffalo protester injured by the police might be antifa. Scott, who was appointed by Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0(R-Ky.) to lead the caucus\u2019 effort, then met with senior White House officials including chief of staff\u00a0Mark Meadows, adviser\u00a0Jared Kushner\u00a0and senior aide\u00a0Ja\u2019Ron Smith. And Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of Trump\u2019s top conservative allies in the House, is aiming to release his own plan to improve police practices by the end of this week. But Scott said he\u2019s on a \u2018separate track\u2019 from the White House. And other Republicans said Tuesday afternoon that Trump himself is not yet intimately involved in negotiations on what could become law.\u201dRepublicans find useful wedge with \u2018defund police\u2019 -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cPresident Trump and Republicans are building a plank of their campaign strategy on the push to \u2018defund the police,\u2019 casting it as a dangerous Democratic move that threatens public safety, as likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his allies distance themselves from the movement. Facing sagging poll numbers and following months of crisis, the Trump campaign and congressional Republicans see political opportunity in the calls for defunding police departments coming from activists and some progressive leaders.\u201dCONCERNS GROW ABOUT CORONA SPIKE FROM PROTESTSCBS News: \u201cAdministration officials on the White House Coronavirus Task Force told governors Monday they are concerned the nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in late May could lead to a rise in coronavirus infections. During a conference call with governors, an audio recording of which was obtained by CBS News from a participant, Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0and Dr.\u00a0Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, said they're closely tracking coronavirus cases in the wake of the large-scale demonstrations. \u2026 \u2018It's an issue our team is following and there is concern,\u2019 Pence said in response to a question from Rhode Island Governor\u00a0Gina Raimondo\u00a0about outbreaks stemming from the protests. \u2026 Birx told governors most major metropolitan areas were experiencing a significant decline in new cases through May and into June. But she said the efficacy of masks worn by shouting demonstrators is unknown and not all protesters were wearing masks, raising cause for concern.\u201dAdministration opposes extending unemployment benefits -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cU.S. Labor Secretary\u00a0Eugene Scalia\u00a0said he opposed the extension of $600 a week in unemployment benefits that workers are receiving as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, an option lawmakers are debating as they negotiate the next stimulus bill. Mr. Scalia said the enhanced payments, included in a federal stimulus package signed into law at the end of March, will have served their usefulness by the time the current program expires at the end of July.\u201dMembers of National Guard test positive -\u00a0NY Post: \u201cSome DC National Guard troops deployed to protests in Washington have tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Tuesday \u2014 as top White House coronavirus task force members warned governors of a possible spike in infections tied to the nationwide demonstrations. The service members were among 1,300 DC National Guard members called to assist law enforcement in responding to anti-police brutality protests in the nation\u2019s capital beginning on May 31, a spokeswoman confirmed to McClatchy DC. She would not say how many troops had tested positive for the virus, but US officials told the Associated Press they believe it is not currently a large number.\u201dPennsylvania poised for constitutional fight on lockdown -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cRepublicans in the Pennsylvania legislature and Democratic Gov.\u00a0Tom Wolf\u00a0appear to be hurtling toward a constitutional battle over whether lawmakers have the power to override Wolf's coronavirus restrictions and get the state back to business-as-usual. The Pennsylvania House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, passed a resolution Tuesday purporting to override Wolf's coronavirus disaster declaration and directing the governor to \u2018issue an executive order or proclamation ending the state of disaster emergency.\u2019 \u2018The Senate voted on a resolution to end Governor Wolf's statewide shut down, which has been hurting families and doing irreparable harm to employers,\u2019 Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Jake Corman\u00a0said Tuesday.\u201dDEM DIVISIONS THREATEN BID AGAINST MCCONNELLFox News: \u201cJust as a new poll showed Kentucky Democrat\u00a0Amy McGrath\u00a0pulling into a statistical tie in her U.S. Senate election fight against the incumbent, Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell, some other news emerged that could spell trouble for her campaign. McGrath's chief Democratic primary challenger -- state Rep.\u00a0Charles Booker\u00a0-- received endorsements Tuesday from two big-name fellow progressives: U.S. Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0of Vermont and U.S. Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0of New York. \u2018As Louisville has become an epicenter of national tragedy and protests due to the police murders of\u00a0Breonna Taylor\u00a0and\u00a0David McAtee, Charles has shown leadership by showing up on the frontlines,\u2019 Sanders wrote in a statement, according to the Courier Journal of Louisville. \u2018He was an endorser of our campaign for president and supports progressive policies such as criminal justice reform, Medicare for All and getting big money out of politics.\u2019\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYFormer judge finds \u2018gross abuse\u2019 of power by Justice Department in Flynn case\u00a0-\u00a0NYTFloyd's brother testifies at House hearing on police brutality -\u00a0Fox NewsPergram: Unrest, coronavirus show limits to Congress' power -\u00a0Fox NewsAUDIBLE: OOPS\u201cJohn\u2019s memory should be used promote common ground and civility not to stoke division.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Cindy McCain\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in response to an ad by\u00a0Amy McGrath, running for the Dem nomination in Kentucky\u2019s Senate race, touting the late Sen.\u00a0John McCain\u2019s vote on the repeal of Obamacare in 2017.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cI read your report regularly and think highly of it. That your Battleground Power Rankings is not updated frequently is just fine with me. But it should be updated at least once a month, and more often if there has been significant movement. It's been over a month, and there has been significant movement (although I am surprised to note, in only a few states enough to change their status). Opinions will differ on some of the few states where a case can be made for a change in status. But at the very least consider Georgia, which you still classify \u2018Leans Republican.\u2019 For a while it has looked more like a \u2018Toss-up\u2019 to me, and now several legitimate articles are saying that it is leaning towards the Democrats, and by more than a little. I would still consider it a \u2018Toss-up.\u2019\u201d \u2013\u00a0Marvant Duhon, Bloomington, Ind.\n[Ed. note: Democrats most definitely have their eyes on Georgia in a big way, and Georgia may indeed turn out to be competitive. Georgia never has been as Republican as its neighbors South Carolina and Alabama, as evidenced by\u00a0Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 victory there. Georgia and Louisiana are the only two Deep South states to have voted for a Democrat since 1980. Like Texas, Georgia seems within reach for Democrats in a big blue year. There\u2019s very little polling to rely on, but what little there is certainly suggests a close contest. But of the three states we have listed as \u201clean Republican\u201d we would be more likely to move Iowa based primarily on polling than either Texas or Georgia. Iowa swung 12 points from 2012 to 2016, indicating a state with a significant number of persuadable voters. That\u2019s the same reason Ohio looks so competitive this time around despite going so big for Trump in 2016. Iowa and Ohio are swing states in the true sense, while Texas and Georgia are not. Like Minnesota on the Democratic side, these are states where the partisan advantage is not large, but it is consistent. If states like Georgia, Texas and Arizona go blue this time, you can assume that the election has broken substantially for the challenger and that all of the swing states are already in the D column. We will certainly be watching Georgia and Texas closely, but so early in the campaign we still need some convincing.\u00a0And I promise we are always reviewing and reconsidering. Keep your eyes peeled for adjustments.]\n\u201cRather than wish people to \u2018please keep yourself safe\u2019 would it not be better to wish that people keep themselves informed?\u00a0 Your comment of the killing of a black man in Ferguson does not address the fact that the officer was attacked which caused the shooting of the unarmed black man.\u00a0 So said the investigation and the jury. Case and news about same\u2014dropped.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Kenneth Kercher, Plano, Texas\n[Ed. note: I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s an either or question, Mr. Kercher. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to since I don\u2019t recall talking about the circumstances of the\u00a0Michael Brown\u00a0shooting recently. But I do know what the inquest found about Brown\u2019s conduct. I also know what the probe into the department\u2019s practices found. There is always more to learn and more to see. I hope for you that that process never ends and that you also will keep yourself well.]\n\u201cWow, your description of\u00a0Walter Russell Mead\u2019s WSJ opinion piece on 6/9 was just terrible! His article pointed out that our enemies often foolishly misunderstand what is going on in our country and do so at their peril. Your \u2018cliff notes\u2019 portrayal takes one paragraph and puts it forth as though it represents the theme of the entire article. I read and enjoy \u2018Halftime\u2019 most need to do better than you did with this today.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jim Lientz, Atlanta\n[Ed. note: It\u2019s good then that you clicked through and read the whole thing! I hope you know that, especially with opinion columns, the goal is to put forward something provocative from the piece that might spur further reading and thought. You are quite right that Mead expresses hopeful confidence that new efforts to exploit American divisions will be as unsuccessful as those of\u00a0Napoleon III.]\n\u201cI am a white moderate Independent married to a black Republican for over 35 years, and we tried to raise our three children to respect a diversity of opinion.

In your June 4th column Terribly Shallow, you state as fact that racism is real and as fact that police kill blacks at a lower rate than whites. I don't think your words do justice to what our country needs to face, together. You base the latter statement of fact on one study that examines fatal officer-involved shootings (FOIS) and finds \u2018no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities...and, if anything, anti-White disparities when controlling for race-specific crime,\u2019 a little less definitive than your conclusion. It finds anti-White disparities across the different types of shootings but suggests the need for more data for the shooting sub-types, such as \u2018unarmed,\u2019 for which other studies found anti-Black disparities, and \u2018mental health or suicide-related,\u2019 for which other studies found anti-White disparities. The study does not look at other uses of police force, such as the kind of force used on George Floyd, or deaths in police custody. There are many research papers published in respected peer-reviewed journals and on the pubmed\u00a0site. Check out this\u00a0paper\u00a0or this\u00a0resource. Thank you for reading this letter.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Chris Howard, Mesa, Ariz.\n[Ed. note: First, thank you for sending the letter and for your readership. Thank you also for passing on the research you have. I don\u2019t want to duck your central critique, but I would point out that in no way are we aiming to be a primary resource on the matter of police brutality or racism in America today. This is a note about politics and elections, which sometimes takes us into the roiled waters of issues like these. That said, you\u2019re quite right that there is much, much more to these subjects than what we whisked by on June 4. Our point in sharing some discomfiting facts was that there are not simple or easy answers here. I wondered whether to include any research on the subject since it could be seen as somehow definitive rather than, as you observe, part of a larger discussion among social scientists. This is not an issue with \u201csides\u201d because there are no either/or propositions except for among extremists and those who wish to exploit rather than resolve our problems. Our work of living in peace with our fellow Americans and measuring up to the promise of the American Creed has to happen every day, in every community. We just wanted to remind readers that there are no pat answers.]\n\u201cI'll readily admit that I haven't done a deep dive into all the different communications sources pontificating on the current state of policing across the country.\u00a0 But from the large amount of information and political posturing I have seen surrounding the murder of George Floyd, there has been scant mention of the role the local police union played in this atrocity. It is my understanding that the office charged with murder had more than a dozen (17?) complaints against him and in every case the union prevented him from being significantly disciplined or fired. My take on a major part of the reform needed is a streamlining of the disciplinary process for all men and women wearing the badges and a reduction in the power of the police unions across the country to protect the \u2018Bad Apples\u2019 we all know exist within the ranks of our amazing officers in blue.\u00a0 If early on in their careers, those in blue who cross the line could be...at a minimum...significantly disciplined and receive mandatory retraining for their violations without union lawyers interfering, perhaps we could reduce the number of incidents we read about from across the country and relieve some of the pressure building up in our large cities.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jim Kinney, Hoschton, Ga.\n[Ed. note: We ask a great deal of police in the United States. For salaries often below the national median income, officers are expected to act as counselors, first aid administrators, child advocates and community resources in addition to the dangerous and often deadly work of enforcing the law and keeping the peace. It's understandable that they would want the kinds of protection that a union or a guild can provide in terms of the execution of their duties and the maintenance of standards. But it is also true that union leaders get and maintain power by pleasing their constituents: officers themselves. And police will predictably seek more protections against discipline. Like with our schoolteachers, what it takes to win a union election may be something at odds with the general welfare. In a system based on competing ambitions that might be okay, but in some communities there has been little pushback on such questions allowing police unions to steamroll local governments. This is, by the way, one of the reasons it is so crucial for us to understand this as a local, not federal matter. Every police force is as different as the 15,000 or so communities that they serve. In some communities it may be that unions need to be put in check, while in others it may be that police are unfairly treated by hostile local governments.]\n\u201cWhere do I get the recipes you talk about on your podcast with Dana?

            "article_content": "Covington Catholic graduate Nicholas Sandmann opens up about his support for Trump on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' For the second time in as many nights, the Republican National Convention has put the Democratic Nationally Televised Zoom call to shame. Viewers might be hard-pressed to remember much about last Tuesday\u2019s Democratic show beyond the awkward hard cuts, missed cues, dead air\u00a0and the parade of people making a spectacle of wearing masks outside as they announced their delegations\u2019 vote totals. Coronavirus necessitates certain precautions and concessions. Unlike the teleconference-quality DNC, however, you\u00a0might\u00a0believe that\u00a0Tuesday night\u2019s\u00a0tightly produced, professional program was the Republicans\u2019 plan from the beginning. MICHAEL GOODWIN: AT RNC TRUMP IS PUTTING ON GREATEST REALITY SHOW ON EARTH But the RNC\u2019s second night wasn\u2019t just superior in style \u2013\u00a0it delivered on substance. Throughout the event, the Republicans reiterated their pledge to empower Americans who have been forgotten by the political elites, building on President Trump\u2019s record of fighting for the defenseless. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Pro-life activist Abby Johnson delivered a powerful speech about the horrors of the abortion industry\u00a0she was once part of as director of a Planned Parenthood center. She praised\u00a0the president for his ongoing\u00a0and substantial\u00a0effort to defend\u00a0all human life, including the unborn. Johnson\u00a0may have given the most riveting case for life I\u2019ve heard.\u00a0When she said that she can still \u201csmell abortion, because abortion has a smell,\u201d she spoke with conviction of someone who saw firsthand that the abortion center was not about \u201cwomen\u2019s health,\u201d but about money. \u201cI now support President Trump because he has done more for the unborn than any other president,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthis election is a choice between two radical anti-life activists and the most pro-life president we have ever had. That\u2019s something that should compel you to action.\u201d Nick Sandmann, a teenager who was defamed and harassed by the mainstream media following his encounter with aggressive liberal activists during a school trip to Washington D.C., also delivered a spectacular address about the dangers of media bias. \u201cI heard what was happening to me had a name. It was called being \u2018canceled\u2019 \u2013\u00a0as in annulled; as in revoked; as in made void,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Canceling\u2019 is what\u2019s happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left. Many are being fired, humiliated\u00a0or even threatened. And often, the media is a willing participant.\u201d It was first lady Melania Trump, however, who tied a bow around the dual themes of the convention \u2013\u00a0enthusiasm and substance. Vice President Mike Pence revealed the human face of school choice, showcasing the stories of American families whose lives have been immeasurably improved by the Trump administration\u2019s determination to make quality education available to all Americans. Eric Trump likewise made a persuasive case, as only a son can, that his father will fight for each and every one of us just as hard during his second term as he did during his first. It was first lady Melania Trump, however, who tied a bow around the dual themes of the convention \u2013\u00a0enthusiasm and substance \u2013\u00a0ending the evening with a beautiful speech that addressed her \u201cBe Best\u201d campaign and cyberbullying,\u00a0and honored the victims of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a reminder that when we vote for president, we also elect a first lady to guide our nation\u2019s moral direction.\u00a0Her grace, elegance and charm were only exceeded by the depth of the issues she artfully addressed. \u201cAs you have heard\u00a0this evening, I don\u2019t want to use this precious time attacking the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause as we saw last week, that kind of talk only serves to divide the country further.\u201d \u201cI urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to standard American ideas,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the color of a person\u2019s skin.\u201d Delivered before a live audience in the White House Rose Garden that she personally redesigned, Melania\u2019s speech ended the evening on the same optimistic note that prevailed from the very first speech. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Her critics from the left had nothing useful to attack except that she had delivered the speech from the White House grounds \u2013\u00a0federal property.\u00a0Yes, the same Democrats that have been shockingly silent about the destruction, burning\u00a0and looting of federal property and statues by the rioters and anarchists that Democrats defend by their silence.

            "article_content": "Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla talks to Fox News about being on the list of potential running mates for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. She also shares her insights as a career law enforcement officer of 27 years and Orlando\u2019s first female Chief of Police into the shooting deaths of unarmed 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and 26-year-old Louisville EMT Breonna Taylor. Democratic Rep. Val Demings, a finalist to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate, touted the former vice president\u2019s choice to tap Kamala Harris to join him on the ticket, cheering his pick. \u201cFor a little girl who grew up poor, Black and female in the South to be considered during this process has been an incredible honor,\u201d Demings, D-Fla., tweeted Tuesday. \u201cI feel so blessed.\u201d BIDEN TAPS KAMALA HARRIS AS RUNNING MATE \u201cTo see a Black woman nominated for the first time reaffirms my faith that in America, there is a place for every person to succeed no matter who they are or where they come from,\u201d she continued, noting that America deserves \u201cleadership that will not only put America back on track, but #BuildBackBetter.\u201d Demings went on to say that the Biden-Harris ticket \u201cpromises to restore America\u2019s faith that we can defeat COVID-19, save our crippled economy, restore honor and integrity to the WH, protect the rights, liberty, and safety of the American people, and expand access to health care and opportunity for all.\u201d \u201cI will continue to work to make the American Dream an attainable reality for every person in our country, and continue the struggle for a more perfect union,\u201d Demings said. \u201cTo that end, I am excited to do everything in my power to ensure that on January 20th, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris will be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States.\u201d Demings, a second-term congresswoman\u00a0and the first female police chief for the Orlando Police Department, was reportedly\u00a0on the shortlist for Biden\u2019s running mate. She gained national exposure as one of the House impeachment managers that made the chamber\u2019s case against President Trump in his Senate impeachment trial earlier this year. Meanwhile, Harris, the Democratic senator from California and former 2020 presidential hopeful, said she is \u201chonored\u201d to join the ticket as Biden\u2019s running mate. \u201c@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he\u2019s spent his life fighting for us,\u201d the Democratic senator from California tweeted. \u201cAnd as president, he\u2019ll build an America that lives up to our ideals.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m honored to join him as our party\u2019s nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.\u201d TRUMP CAMPAIGN BLASTS 'PHONY' KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS BIDEN PICK REFLECTS 'EXTREME AGENDA' Harris\u2019\u00a0tweet comes after Biden announced in an email to supporters on Tuesday afternoon that he had chosen her as his running mate, saying that he \u201cdecided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021.\u201d Biden also tweeted: \"I have the great honor to announce that I\u2019ve picked\u00a0@KamalaHarris \u2014 a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants \u2014 as my running mate.\u201d He added: \"Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this\u00a0campaign.\u201d The decision comes after Biden and Harris publicly clashed in the primary campaign \u2014 notably when Harris challenged him on the debate stage of his past resistance to federally mandated desegregation busing. The pick shows a willingness from both Biden and Harris to move past their differences. The decision may have been tipped off days earlier, when he was photographed with talking points saying of Harris that he does \u201cnot hold grudges\u201d and has \u201cgreat respect for her.\u201d The choice also fulfills a commitment the former vice president made in March to name a woman as running mate. Naming a Black woman at a time when issues of systemic racism are front and center also responds to signals from some circles in the party that such a choice could help build bridges with the Black community. The timing gives Biden plenty of space to re-introduce her to voters ahead of this month\u2019s scaled-back Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign blasted Biden's pick, calling Harris a \"phony,\" while saying the choice reflects the former vice president\u2019s \u201cextreme agenda.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Judge Amy Coney Barrett responds to senators during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0said she expected attacks against her faith and her family when she was nominated to the high court, but that she and her family are \"all-in\" on serving her country. The\u00a0Senate\u00a0Judiciary Committee began grilling Barrett on Tuesday as her marathon hearing continued. She spent the first half of the day being pressed by Democrats on abortion, ObamaCare and more, while repeatedly declining to weigh in on hot-button issues, invoking the so-called \"Ginsburg rule.\" \"I've tried to be on a media blackout for the sake of my mental health,\" Barrett told the committee. \"You can't keep yourself walled off from everything and I'm aware of a lot of the caricatures\u00a0that are floating around.\" She added: \"We knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked.\u00a0And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it because what sane person would go through that if there wasn't a benefit on the other side?\" Barrett continued to say that the benefit is \"that I'm committed to the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court in dispensing equal justice for all. And I'm not the only person who can do this job. But I was asked, and it would be difficult for anyone. So why should I say someone else should do the difficulty if the difficulty is the only reason to say no?\" The hearing Tuesday began with\u00a0impassioned broadsides from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., against the Affordable Care Act (ACA), while Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein. D-Calif., attempted to drill down on Barrett's abortion stance, as well as her opinions on gun rights and the ACA. \"What I'm trying to do very briefly this morning is to demonstrate the difference between politics and judging,\" Graham, R-S.C., said as he opened the hearing before saying he would present his preferred health care vision. \"All of my colleagues on the other side had emotional pleas about ObamaCare,\" Graham said. \"ObamaCare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina. All of you over there want to impose ObamaCare on South Carolina. We don't want it. We want something better.\" No hints, no previews, no forecasts LIVE UPDATES: AMY CONEY BARRETT'S HEARING CONTINUES AFTER TENSE OPENING DAY Graham also cited hospital closings, premium increases and a higher proportion of federal money going to blue states under the ACA. \"I want a better deal,\" Graham said. \"The best way to get innovation is to allow people to try different things to get better outcomes.\" Meanwhile, Feinstein\u00a0asked Barrett to be forthright about her views on abortion and Roe v. Wade and tried to drill down on Barrett's stances on a number of issues. \"I do want to be forthright and answer every question so far as I can,\" Barrett said, citing Justice Elena Kagan's confirmation hearing. \"She said that she was not going to grade precedent or give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.\" \"It\u00a0would actually be wrong and in violation of the cannons for me\u00a0to do that as a sitting judge,\" Barrett added. Feinstein shot back: \"On something that is really a major cause with major effect on half of the population of this country, it's distressing not to get a straight answer.\" DEMS WARN BARRETT CONFIRMATION MEANS DOOM FOR OBAMACARE, BUT 'SEVERABILITY' DOCTRINE MIGHT SAVE IT Barrett responded that she understood the question, but could not \"pre-commit\" to a certain view on Roe v. Wade or its progeny Planned Parenthood v. Casey. During questioning from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Barrett talked about how she tries to make sure she avoids bias in her decisions. \"One practice I have, one check that I put on myself, to make sure that I'm not biased is that when I write an opinion\u00a0I try to read it from the perspective of the losing party,\" Barrett said. \"So that any sympathy that I might feel for the particular result that I reach, I try to make the sympathy run the other way to see if ti will still hold and also to see .. would I still think it was a well-reasoned opinion.\" She added: \"I think discipline is required but I take it very very seriously.\" As Feinstein continued to ask Barrett if she agreed with certain statements on precedent, Barrett continued to refuse to give answers committing to a certain outcome of a case. Barrett did add that she would follow the principles of \"stare decisis,\" which is the concept that the court will defer to past decisions in most cases, depending on a complex confluence of factors. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., brought up Democrats calls for Barrett to recuse herself specifically from any election-related cases.\u00a0\"He's counting on you to deliver him the election,\" Leahy said, noting comments by the president. Barrett said that she would not be able to make any commitment on recusing herself until a case came before her, citing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's description of when a justice should recuse herself. COONS SAYS THAT CONFIRMING BARRETT 'CONSTITUTES COURT PACKING,' SASSE RESPONDS THAT'S 'OBVIOUSLY' INCORRECT \"Not only reading the [recusal] statute, looking at the precedent, consulting counsel if necessary,\" Barrett said of the process of considering recusal. \"While it is always the decision of the individual justice, it always happens after consultation with the full court. So I can't offer an opinion on recusal without short-circuiting that entire process.\" The nominee also emphasized that she has \"made no commitment to anyone... about how I would decide any case.\" Leahy lamented that \"The president has placed both you and the Supreme Court in the worst\u00a0of positions,\" with comments he's made about how Trump hopes any election-related cases might be decided. Added Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., \"Who came up with this insulting notion that you might violate your oath?...\u00a0Could it have come from the White House? Could it have come from the president's tweets?... That's where it comes from.\" Other Democrats have demanded that Barrett recuse herself from the\u00a0California v. Texas ACA case specifically. Barrett also avoided making commitments when Feinstein asked her to weigh in on California v. Texas, the Supreme Court case set to be argued on Nov. 10 that could overturn the ACA. Barrett refused to talk about the case except to say it had to do with the concept of \"severability.\" When a court decides a part of a law is unconstitutional and must be overturned, it then decides whether the rest of the law can stand without that part, or if the entire law must fall because the unconstitutional part was too central to its purposes. \"I haven't written about severability that I know of at all,\" Barrett said when asked to weigh in on severability. She added that because the case is on the Supreme Court's docket \"the cannons of judicial conduct would prevent me from expressing a view.\" Absolutely not, I was never asked. And if I had have been, that would have been a short conversation WHERE HAS AMY CONEY BARRETT RULED ON KEY ISSUES? Democrats continued their theme from Monday of emphasizing the consequences if the ACA were repealed, which they posit would likely happen if Barrett is confirmed. \"[The coronavirus] is seen as a preexisting condition. Do you know how many million Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and survived?\" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked Barrett, who herself caught the coronavirus this summer and recovered, according to reports. Barrett said she did not. \"That's more than 7,700,000 Those are people who are not considered to have a preexisting condition,\" Leahy explained. He later noted that President Trump said he wanted the ACA to be overturned, and suggested that the president \"is confident\" Barrett would overturn the ACA. Feinstein also questioned Barrett about gun rights in regard\u00a0to\u00a0Kanter v. Barr, a case in which Barrett said governments can limit the gun rights of people who are dangerous, but that being convicted of a nonviolent felony does not necessarily make a person dangerous enough to have their rights limited. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., criticized Barrett on the Kanter ruling, saying she was giving more \"respect\" to gun rights than voting rights. Durbin\u00a0claimed\u00a0that even nonviolent felons are more likely to commit violent crimes in the future and said\u00a0it would be unreasonable for judges to decide who is likely to be violent in the future and who is not. \"We on the court ... have to make judgments all the time on what count as crimes of violence,\" Barrett said, specifically referencing the Armed Career Criminal\u00a0Act. She added that she remembered questioning the\u00a0evidence Durbin cited about nonviolent felons being more likely to commit violent crimes. Barrett added on voting rights that \"what I said was that the Constitution contemplates that states have the freedom to deprive felons of the right to vote,\" before noting that she was not expressing a personal view on the policy. On gay marriage, Feinstein asked whether Barrett agreed with a point made by late Justice Antonin Scalia that the Constitution does not fundamentally give gay people the right to marry.\u00a0Barrett responded, \"If I were confirmed you would be getting Justice\u00a0Barrett, not Justice Scalia ... but I'm not going to express a view ... for the same reasons that I've been giving.\" She then quoted late Justice Ginsburg's philosophy on judicial hearings:\u00a0\"No hints, no previews, no forecasts.\" Under questioning from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Barrett added that she was not asked to make any commitments by President Trump and would not make any commitment to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley further asked whether Barrett was asked to overrule the ACA or if that was her agenda. \"Absolutely not, I was never asked. And if I had have been, that would have been a short conversation,\" Barrett shot back. DEMS TURN AROUND ACCUSATION, SAY GOP IS COURT PACKING: HERE'S WHAT THAT PHRASE ACTUALLY MEANS Democratic Senators'\u00a0calls for packing the Supreme Court in recent months also came up during the hearing, specifically while Barrett was being questioned by Lee. She and Lee both made clear that the size of the Supreme Court is set by Congress. Court packing is the practice of increasing the size of the Supreme Court in order to seat sympathetic justices for political gain, as former President Franklin Roosevelt also proposed. Lee said that adding justices to the Supreme Court would be a \"colossal mistake\" and cited a 1983 speech by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in which he opposed court\u00a0packing. He then slammed Democrats over some who have claimed that confirming Barrett \"constitutes court packing.\" \"In recent days I've seen some in the media and some in this body try to redefine what it means to pack the court. Some have suggested well court packing takes various forms and it can mean confirming a lot of people all at once. Some have defined it so as to suggest that it consists of doing that which the Trump administration and the Republican Senate have been doing over the last three and a half years which is filling vacancies as they have arisen,\" Lee said. He added, raising his voice: \"This is not court packing. Court packing is itself manipulative and it's something that has great dangers to do immense political and constitutional harm to our system of government.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden and his running-make Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., have steadfastly refused to tell Americans whether or not they would pack the Supreme Court if elected. The fast-paced questioning by Graham of Barrett, which also touched on a couple of other major precedents, including school desegregation\u00a0and gun rights, and the \"severability\" doctrine as it applies to the ACA, was\u00a0the start of what is set to be a marathon two days of hearings. Barrett, as noted by ABC's Trish Turner, was not using notes\u00a0Tuesday. \"We begin tomorrow 30-minutes rounds followed by 20-minute rounds,\" Graham said on Monday afternoon, as the opening statements in the hearings closed. \"Just do the math, we've got a couple long days ahead of us, so get some rest.\" The Judiciary Committee plans to give all 22 of its members 30 minutes each to question Barrett on Tuesday in a hearing extending late into the evening.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams, along with Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, Trey Gowdy and Kennedy. It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five. The fight for the White House kicking into high gear. Joe Biden finding himself in some hot water after these comments suggesting that the Latino community is more diverse than the African American community. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things. You go to Florida you find a very different attitude about immigration in certain places and you do when you're in Arizona. So, it's a very different a very diverse community. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir -- (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: President Trump hitting Biden claiming that he is, quote, \"no longer worthy of the black vote.\" The former vice president then clarifying his comments on Twitter, saying in part and here I quote, \"in no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith. Not by identity, not on issues, not at all.\" End quote. So, will Biden's stumble give Trump's campaign new momentum? The latest Real Clear Politics average shows the race is tightening. Greg, I thought I would start with you, welcome back. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you. WILLIAMS: Do you think that this gaffe -- that this gaffe is going to attract anymore votes to President Trump other than let's say Kanye West? GUTFELD: Well, you know what, gaffes are great when they tell the truth. Joe Biden spoke the party's truth. They see blacks as a homogenous entity. It's why they mock and marginalized people like you just did with Kanye West. Anybody who is outside the box, Kanye West, Candace Owens, Thomas Sowell. You name it. If you don't fit into the Democrats assumption of what a black person should be and what Joe Biden decides who a black person should be because you remember, it was just it was just a few maybe a month ago he decided, he was the one who decided who was black and who wasn't. The fact is that Dems just assumes they don't have to do squat for blacks because they got them in the back pocket. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is actively competing for those votes, you know, he tried to get the lowest unemployment in modern history, he helped out historical black colleges, he went for prison reform. He shows that he's got he believes in competing for that vote, also the difference between Republicans and Democrats, Republicans never denied Trump's flaws. They knew that he could be crude, rude, and even offensive. But the Democrats they are in full denial of a substantial structural flaw. Their candidate may be losing his mind. And it's not even that. It's not funny. It's kind of sad because, you know, it would be OK if you could laugh about it. But this guy, he's not going to be the nominee, Juan, and you know it. He is going to be gone before November. That is not going to happen. WILLIAMS: Wait, you say Biden -- wait, Biden is going to be gone? GUTFELD: Yes. I predict that's why they haven't had the V.P.. They haven't selected the V.P. yet because you can't select the V.P. until you have the P. And if you select the V.P., what if the V.P. -- what if the V.P. should be P. Like what if you select Kamala Harris but she should be the P so you can't pick her for V.P. That's the -- that's the theory. I'm sticking to it. WILLIAMS: OK. All right. All right. I hear you loud and clear. Kennedy, what do you make of this so-called gaffe? It looks like it's getting more attention, to pick up on Greg's point. It's getting more attention on the right than on the left and even among black people. KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: What a surprise that this race is being covered with partiality and imbalance. That's very shocking to me. I'm so relieved that the race war is now three-dimensional. Good job, Joe. I think it's really important to pit Latino voters against African American voters. That was really, really important and I hope every single voter regardless of race or party or geographic location, I hope they look at both candidates, both of the mainstream candidates very skeptically. And remember that Joe Biden was the one who talked of his relationship with segregationists. He was the one who authored bills with Strom Thurmond when they were both on the Senate judiciary committee. He was the ranking member while Strom Thurmond was the chairman and they authored that 1986 anti-drug abuse bill that created those sensing disparities that put an entire generation of black men in prison because they got a lot more time for doing crack than white offenders did for doing cocaine, which essentially it's the exact same drug. He also authored the 1994 crime bill. But it wasn't just Strom Thurmond. James Eastland. There were other members of the Senate who are avowed segregationists and Joe Biden talked up his relationship with all of them. He's got a lot of problems and that's why Charlamagne Tha God really took a harsher tone with Joe Biden than many other favorable leftists have in media because he wants some answers to those questions. And that's when Joe Biden made another gaffe that Greg was talking about when he said if you vote for Trump, you are not black. That is incredibly offensive. And it is toxic pandering that is totally unnecessary given where we are at this point in our modern political history. WILLIAMS: Trey Gowdy, another dustup on the campaign trail yesterday with Trump saying Biden is out to hurt God. So, I come to you because you know politics inside and out. Is it intended to help the president with the Evangelical base? Who is he playing to hear? TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't know, Juan. Because I don't -- I'm not a theologian but I'm not sure you can hurt God. And I think with the PGA and NBA starting, I'm not sure God is following politics right now. I think what Republicans ought to be talking about -- what Republicans ought to be talking about is contrasting all of the aspects of the American family and whether you're better off the last four years than you were under Biden and Obama. And to Kennedy's point, I mean, it's always been a challenge to understand what Joe Biden said. Now you add the variable of what did he mean? Even if he has a moment of lucidity and you understand exactly what he said, he is a recidivist when it comes to saying racially curious things. Remember what he said, Juan, about -- about President Obama, that he was the first mainstream candidate that is clean and articulate. I mean, what does that mean? He says you're not black if you're not going to vote for him. Well, that's news to Tim Scott. He's been black his entire life. So, he has a career offender as it relates to racially curious comments. This is just the latest, Juan. WILLIAMS: OK. So, Dana, the Real Clear Politics average has now vice -- I'm sorry, yes, former Vice President Biden leading by 6.4 points. A month ago, it was nine points. So, it has tightened a little bit. You know, FiveThirtyEight has a seven-point margin but anyway, the point is Bill Stepien, the new campaign manager for President Trump says he thinks this tightening is a result of the president holding briefings again. What do you think? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, first, I would like to welcome Trey Gowdy to The Five. I mean, that was a fantastic debut of a segment. I think a couple of things. Juan, remember I said from the beginning that as we get closer to fall, it is going to tighten up and guess what, we are closer to fall so it's tightening up because people start paying a little more attention. And the other thing is that the Trump campaign had maintained that during the coronavirus it was difficult for them to pay a lot of attention to defining Joe Biden. They were trying to figure out what would work. And I think they've alighted upon the thing that is working best which is to suggest that he would be pull this bait and switch when it comes to saying that he would be very moderate but actually be very progressive. And as the Trump campaign says, a tool for the left. I do want to mention something on timing though. And if the Trump campaign wants these numbers to tighten even more, I think they should think about something like this. Yesterday when Joe Biden said those comments that he then apologize for, and then in a video and then he tweeted about because he was having to clean it up, I think the best thing if you are the Trump campaign, if you're the president, stand back. Don't -- just let the media cover that story for the day. When the president suggested that Joe Biden did not have religion, that he didn't believe in his faith and that he wanted to hurt God, immediately that's the story. So, you -- everyone is going to go and cover that as well. The Joe Biden comments about his thinking about blacks and how they think would have been the main story today. So, I would just say that if they want those numbers to tighten, even make it a little closer, let Joe Biden have some time in the sun. WILLIAMS: Free advice from Dana Perino for the Trump camp. Could the lawsuit to dissolve the NRA end up hurting Democrats in November? We are going to debate that hot topic next for you on The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Will New York state's lawsuit to dissolve the NRA backfire on Democrats in November? Some swing state Democrats are worried it will energize conservative voters. And in fact, the Pennsylvania lawmakers saying the lawsuit is the left's, quote, \"equivalent of an Alabama attorney general suing to dissolve Planned Parenthood.\" And a Wall Street Journal op-ed accusing New York's Attorney General, Letitia James of, quote, \"giving the political game away months before the presidential election.\" Greg, one of those old phrases comes to mind, stepping on a rake. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: Where the Democrats think that they are doing something but it's like wait, what did we just do? We are going -- I can understand that NRA membership being frustrated about the financial conditions of the NRA and the things that were going on. But if you want an us versus them scenario, now you have a very energized NRA membership. GUTFELD: They should -- she should change her name to litigious James? Huh? How about that for a Friday? Shoot me. PERINO: I like it. GUTFELD: So, the left cannot stop gorging on stupid. If you keep -- if you just look back at this incredible terrain. Endorse rioting, dismissed looting, let off the Boston bomber, let's see what else? Defund cops, dissolve SWATS in some cities? That's amazing. And then when the public, when the public suddenly realizes that only they can protect themselves, that it falls on them because the police is being marginalized, then you're going to go after their guns. They are basically putting -- they're putting the squeeze on the American public who are now beginning to think that this is not going to end in a very good place. And it's the best thing that could ever happen to the firearms industry because people are going to go out buy more guns, it's breaking new records. I've got mine. PERINO: Trey, why would the attorney general not just focus on the financial issues and maybe deal with that in court instead of suggesting dissolving it? GOWDY: Dana, I think she's not looking beyond the New York borders. This is probably a great political play in New York but it is terrible in Colorado and Montana and the Carolinas where there are really competitive Senate seats. I mean, it's not going to take long for someone to figure out the NRA has been around for 150 years and they have the same CEO for 30 years. This investigation has been going on for two months. And in addition to the political peril, it kind of underscores the narrative of Republicans that you're going to use the justice system as a weapon against your political enemies. She checks all of those boxes. Good luck running against Cuomo but it's going to hurt Cory -- it's going to help Cory Gardner in Colorado. PERINO: I'm sure that's welcome news to Republicans in Colorado. But Juan, there are some people who think that at least for suburban voters, their thoughts about NRA and guns has changed. Do you think it's sufficient that change -- sufficiently change that it wouldn't have as big of an impact as some Democrats are worried? WILLIAMS: I'm not sure how to answer that one, Dana. I think that it is the case that NRA voters, people who were voting simply on the issue of gun rights, they were going to vote for President Trump or Senate candidates who are Republican anyway. So, I don't think it changed those votes. In fact, you know, I think that this story may be being framed in the wrong way. Because I remember that the real fight, the real story here was NRA members being upset that they were being ripped off by their own leadership. PERINO: Yes. WILLIAMS: So, it's kind of an intramural issue that you had, remember last year Ollie North was forced out when he said it's time for us to do a financial review of how money is being spent here. In the New York suit, the allegation is that you get people at the top of the NRA draining $64 million in three years -- PERINO: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- from this nonprofit organization. And by the way, just keep in mind, this is the same attorney general's office, not the same attorney general, but the same office that went after the Trump foundation for financial irregularities, money being used for personal benefit and the Trump foundation had to close. PERINO: That is true. That was last year, two years ago, I guess. Kennedy, what do you think about this? Especially, you know, you come from the west. You have perspective on this. MONTGOMERY: I've never seen a time where more people especially some of the Democrats I know were talking about arming themselves and getting some sort of home protection. Because it does feel like in certain cities at certain times of day, you know, being from Portland, that society is kind of ripping apart at the seams and people want to be able to protect their families. You know, if you're just following headlines, and it feels like the police have been defunded. So, what does that mean? No one really knows but the perception could be if I call 911 it's going to take a long time for someone to show up. If someone's breaking into my house, I want to be sure that I have a weapon. And when you hear that the NRA is being sued to dissolve, then people assume the government is coming after their guns. There are only a couple of issues that really get people excited and agitated and get them frothing to vote before an election. Guns is one of them. Abortion obviously. And the Supreme Court. So, I think of the NRA issue is just the M.O.'s bouche and Republicans should write a thank you letter to the A.G. here in New York state. PERINO: And the train has signaled it is time for us to go to break. Up ahead, Portland's mayor accusing rioters of attempted murder after even more violence. We'll explain that one next on The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOWDY: Portland seeing yet another week of violence, the city's mayor condemning rioters for trying to set fire to a police precinct and blocking the exits while cops were still inside. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR TED WHEELER (D-OR), PORTLAND: When you commit arson with an accelerant in an attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people that you have intentionally trapped inside, you are not demonstrating. You are attempting to commit murder. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOWDY: Dana, you're a communications expert. You've got one mayor -- you've got a mayor in Seattle likening it to a block party and you have a mayor in Portland likening it to attempted murder. Why the messaging disparity? Will this be a November issue? How do you reconcile advocating for an improved justice system while separating yourself from anarchy? PERINO: Those are all excellent questions. All I could think of when I was sitting there, you know, watching him as I would like to respond in kind. I was like you, sir, you are the one who allowed this to happen for 70 days. GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: You, sir, are the one that are responsible for this situation. You are the one who has ended up with these pictures all over the country and now you're upset because you're worried that it actually might help the Republicans in the election? Are you kidding me? GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: When you have small business owners to completely unable to do their work. You have moms and dads who think I don't know if this is going to happen. And look, I know this is happening in Portland and it looks, and I know it's not happening right here in the city where I'm living in, this little town. But in your mind when you see these images play over and over again, yes, you think there's a very fine line between civilization and anarchy and the mayor of Portland is the one that basically blurred that line. Now he has to go on Zoom to try to ask the people to back off? It seems like much too little way too late. GOWDY: Well, Greg, Dana mentioned anarchy. The problem with anarchy is eventually you're going to run in to a law that you actually think should be enforced. GUTFELD: Yes. GOWDY: And then it's too late because the law has been undercut. So, you know, where is the line between peaceful protest and what we see in some of these northwestern, northwestern cities? Where is the proper line between peaceful protest and what we are seeing, the lawlessness? GUTFELD: Anyone can see that line. It's called violence. It's called destruction of property. It's called intimidating and abusing the elderly when an elderly woman is trying to put out a fire and the harasser or when another elderly woman is trying to protect the police and they throw paint on her. Look, the Portland mayor isn't mad because people might get hurt. He was concerned over the optics. Think about that. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: He didn't want b role for Donald Trump. He didn't care about the people there. He cared that Donald Trump might win based on his abdication. His abdication has created the b roll that would take you -- it would only take you two minutes to go on Twitter and anywhere else and find half dozen video including what you just saw. So, basically, it was his denial of this that perpetuated the evil that has created this mess. Even the New York Times is admitting they were wrong. I wish today was like a we can swear day because I really want to swear. I mean, that mayor, that mayor if you looked up pile of crap in the dictionary, Ted Wheeler's face would be there because he is legitimately a pile of crap for abdicating his moral spying. His leadership which has allowed all of this to happen. I know that I'm just saying what Dana said but louder. PERINO: And better. GOWDY: I'm going to kind of -- Juan, I'm going to try to synthesize Dana's point with Greg's point. WILLIAMS: OK. GOWDY: The mayor -- the mayor inserted presidential politics and we've heard Democrats refer to law enforcement as stormtroopers and the gestapo. Where is the criticism on your left for shooting lasers and attempting to blind police officers for hurting innocent victims, including ones using a walker? Why now, are we just not hearing it? Is it there in the media is not covering it? Where is the outrage on the left? WILLIAMS: I think you just heard it from Ted Wheeler. I mean, you know, people here are saying Ted Wheeler was negligent or something but I think he was very clear, Trey, in saying that what those people were doing was violent and it was potentially murderous. He used the word murder, that it was wrong. So, I think that's pretty clear. Why? I think people disagree about well, he should have been tougher earlier and the like but I don't think there's much disagreement from the left or the right when it comes to people who would set a fire and trap people in a building. I just think that's illegal, it's wrong, it's immoral on so many levels. So, I just don't think it's a political divide there. I do think that he is also right when he says that the Trump campaign wants those videos and he's trying to use that to say to these people who are engaged in violent behavior hey, are you supporting Trump? Because Trump wants to undermine the power of the peaceful protests in his country. And the way to do it is to point at people who are misbehaving and engaged in illegal activity. So, I think he's right on both counts and I don't think there is a left-right divide over condemnation of violent people. GOWDY: Well, Juan, I guess my question is, waiting until attempted murder is on the table is a long time to wait. I mean, you got to jump over a lot of other crimes. Arson and assault, to get to attempted murder. Where was the criticism 30 days ago, 45 days ago? I mean, everybody is against murder for the most part. How about the other stuff leading up to it? WILLIAMS: Well, you know, this is about, again, local control. And I think that Ted Wheeler is pretty popular. His citizens saw him as containing this rather than pouring accelerant on it, which is what we saw when you had federal agents from Customs out of place showing up for no reason and exacerbating a difficult situation for local officials. GUTFELD: No reason? GOWDY: Kennedy, let me ask you this. WILLIAMS: Absolutely, no, no, no reason. GUTFELD: No reason. MONTGOMERY: OK, thank you. GOWDY: I did some quick research. Minneapolis is 1,700 miles from the Pacific Northwest. What does a state-local police officer committing a crime against an innocent citizen in Minnesota had to do with what we are seeing in the Pacific Northwest? For those of us who like causal connectivity, what is the connection between what happened to George Floyd and what we're seeing on the West Coast, that anarchy? MONTGOMERY: There is no longer action at a distance here. And whatever movements and whatever momentum was created in the murder -- in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, that is completely dissipated in Portland. And that's why I call Ted Wheeler the nutless wonder. I am from Portland. It's a beautiful city. It's disgusting what's happening because Ted Wheeler is walk around going, hey, this is really bad, you guys. Someone should do something about it. It's like, Ted, you're the someone. You're supposed to be leading your city. You're the guy who's supposed to be ensuring that there is safety so people can protest. So, when there are a list of things that people want changed in their city, with their community policing, you can achieve them. You can't when we have what's going on. And now, it is so absurd, I think that Ted Wheeler is a Trump operative. I think he is laid back so long and let his city burn because he knows it is a gift to the Trump campaign. That is the only way to explain it. And I feel Greg's frustration and every business owner and every cop and every person with a family who wants to live a good life in a beautiful city, and they absolutely cannot because it has been hijacked. And for those of you who are peaceful protesters, and I see a lot of my friends on Facebook and Twitter posting images from the protests they go to when they feel like they're accomplishing something, you better differentiate yourself from the people who are trying to commit murder. And if you don't, that's on you. GOWDY: I was listening carefully, and I think I heard a mayor's race in your future. Stick around. The \"FASTEST SEVEN\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MONTGOMERY: Welcome back. It is now time for the \"FASTEST SEVEN.\" First up, here's a shocker. Kanye West's presidential run might just be a spoiler campaign to hurt Joe Biden. West not rejecting the accusation saying a mug could argue with you. I'm not denying it. I just told you. All right, so Juan, are you burning your copies of Jesus and Jesus is king, because now you're hearing that Kanye West might be a Trump operative? WILLIAMS: No, but I got to tell you, Kennedy, I was surprised at how out in the open it was. I saw reporting yesterday indicating that a lawyer who would work for Trump was delivering signatures for him in Wisconsin, in Milwaukee. Journal Sentinel reporting five other Trump operatives involved in efforts to get Kanye on the ballot and up and running in Wisconsin, a swing state as you well know. You know, to me, I got to say, you know, his wife says he's having mental health issues. And I just wonder, you know, is this like, really lowball dirty politics to use the guy like this? I just don't feel good about it. I don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat. MONTGOMERY: Well, you don't have to vote for him if you don't feel good about it. It's not like he's going to be on every single state ballot, Dana, but it is interesting to think that Kanye West might have his own artistic interpretation of what the presidency should look like. PERINO: I thought it was clever today when he was asked about it. He said that he was walking for president not running for president. And look, if this guy -- this is a guy -- this guy is a marketing genius. If he wanted to be on the ballot in all 50 states, he would. So, you do have to wonder, OK, this a little bit of a ploy, a little bit of a Jill Stein situation, if you are the Hillary Clinton campaign and still mad at her about that. I also do -- I don't know that, obviously, but I think that when Kim Kardashian, his wife, asked people to give him some space and to respect their privacy and this situation that they're in, I would -- I would tend to go with what the wife wants. MONTGOMERY: So, Greg, who else should we see running for president? Who are we missing in this field? It's not quite crowded yet, and I'm surprised by that. GUTFELD: Well, you know, I know what -- I know what you're getting at. But no, I'm very happy here at Fox, so I'm staying here. But you know, what? I think you know, running for office -- running for president is like dropping acid. You don't do a whole bunch at once, right, you just -- you microdose. And I think that's what Kanye is doing right now in 2020 is he's microdosing, but in 2024, he's going to go for the whole tab. And let's put it this way. Joe should welcome him on the debate stage. Because if you have Kanye West of the debate stage, it's going to take a lot of pressure off Joe. He should be going like, come on, get up here, please. I'm kind of eaten alive by Trump. It's like, go after Kanye. MONTGOMERY: Yes. But straight to that point, I think we should have a more crowded debate stage. And if Donald Trump and Kanye West tag team against Joe Biden, they really could offer the death blow to his campaign. Am I wrong? GOWDY: Well, if we're going to have a singer on stage, I'd rather have Bono than have Kanye West. I may not -- you know, his wife asked us to show compassion. And my advice to Kanye is run for president if you're qualified and interested, but don't do it to help or hurt anyone else. I think it's sad. I think the whole spectacle is sad, and I'm going to take Kim's advice and be compassionate for once. PERINO: All right. MONTGOMERY: Well, I would like to take Kim's advice and find people who have been imprisoned wrongly and try free them and not the horrible people who went out -- who are released in prison because of COVID concerns who are out raping and murdering again. That's awful. All right, up next, here we go, great news on the air travel front. I'm sorry, Greg, you still can't drink on most flights but your chances of catching COVID on an airplane are slimmer than we thought. A new study finds passengers have a one in 4,300 chance of coming down with Coronavirus on a two-hour flight. Juan, I think this is great news. And you are a very frequent traveler. I know you take the train a lot when you go back and forth between D.C. and New York City. Do you think this will fill up some planes and give people reason to fly about the country a little bit more? WILLIAMS: Well, it should. I mean, obviously, the numbers are real and we like to rely on the scientific data. I think the problem here is that you know, people are pretty scared at the moment and I think more nervous about it because I think, you know, people thought maybe it would go into remission during the summer months. They didn't see it spreading as it's spreading right now. And people are just nervous, Kennedy. So even this study, people say, oh, you know, it's two-hour flight, one in 43,000 I think you said. You know, what was that, you know, Gilligan's Island, a two-hour ride -- you know, two-hour boat ride to nowhere. So, we don't want that. People are still nervous? MONTGOMERY: No, not unless we have the professor on board because he might have some answers. So, Dana, I don't know if you've flown recently. I've flown back and forth across country a few times this summer. And I will tell you, it's only healthy people and they're all germaphobes. Everyone, every flight I've been on, everyone is in a mask. They hand out Purell wipes so you can wipe down your seat and they show a video of how they disinfected the plane. If someone coughed on a plane, I swear to you, if they coughed, they would open the door midflight and throw them out. PERINO: It's never been a safer time to fly. And I think that my -- I hope my mom is watching so that she could maybe reconsider and see about coming out to the Jersey Shore this fall. I hope so. MONTGOMERY: Well, it's -- Greg, I think it's a good time to fly. I know you don't like germs, but you love planes, and you love playing pilot. So, is this study enough to get you your wings, finally? GUTFELD: I think the data will always change and what you thought was right will always turn out to be wrong. We know that the rate of death is actually declining. It's I think down about overall across the country about 1.6 percent. It's still super high but compared to how it wasn't in March and April because we are now testing. And the more you test, the more you realize this stuff is everywhere. This is good news about flying, but they got to get back to serving booze because that's immoral to trap people in a silver tube in the sky and not allow you to get wasted. That's a crime against humanity. MONTGOMERY: They do serve -- they do serve beer and wine on United, allegedly, but they don't have ice cubes. OK, Trey, last word. This is -- this is a bit of good news. It could be good news for the economy. If schools aren't going to open and people are allowed to fly, what could the impact be here? GOWDY: Well, Kennedy, my wife and I flew over the weekend. We drank all the Clorox we could before we left and we felt perfectly fine on that flight. My fear is dying of boredom once I get there, because there's nothing going on in the country. So, the flight was fine, I just don't want to die when I get there of boredom. MONTGOMERY: No, no, you don't. But you're an entertaining person. You are a one-man band. I don't -- I don't share your fear. And please don't go anywhere because \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY,\" you know. The first question, I can't think of a single clean answer to this one, Kennedy, so I'm going to go to you first. From Arlene M., what incredibly common thing have you never done? I can only think of bad things, so I have to start -- I'm going to just sit here and be quiet. MONTGOMERY: I've never in a German pornographic film. GUTFELD: Like I said, common things, common things. I knew going to you first would help. Dana, I bet you and I share a common thing that we both never done but I will let --- see if you say it. PERINO: Well, I have not been in a German pornographic film either, so we have that in common. Also, I have never gone scuba diving. GUTFELD: That's -- I guess that's common. But you know, sometimes that happens in a German pornographic film too. Juan, I shouldn't have started with this question. I should have started with a different question. WILLIAMS: Yes. I don't know. I don't know. This has gone off the rails pretty quick. It's Friday, I guess. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: But I -- that's an interesting question. So, Greg, what was the answer to what you thought you had in common with Dana? GUTFELD: I'm pretty sure she's like me about seafood. I don't eat -- there almost every seafood that everybody's eating I've never had because I look at the -- PERINO: You never had sushi. GUTFELD: Yes, I've never had sushi. WILLIAMS: Really? GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: You're missing out on something. I think it's delightful. GUTFELD: Well, it's from the ocean. The ocean is Earth's toilet. I don't want to eat out of Earth toilet. WILLIAMS: Well, I'm going to visit Earth toilet next week. I'm going to go look at the ocean. There you go. So, I must be truly perverse. Get me in one of those films. GUTFELD: Yes. Trey, what is something -- save us, Trey? What is it -- common thing you've never done? GOWDY: Well, Greg, upon the advice of counsel, I'm not going to respond to the film part of what you just said. I've never seen the sound of music and I've never seen E.T. GUTFELD: Wow, that is a good one. PERINO: Wow. GUTFELD: That is really good, I've never seen sound of music. I've never seen Titanic. I've never seen Titanic. GOWDY: He dies in the end if that helps. PERINO: But you make fun of it all the time. GUTFELD: And Gone with the Win. I never saw Gone with the Wind which is good because it's racist, joking. OK, the only one question, this is a good one. What do you wish was illegal? Dana, what do you wish was illegal? PERINO: Marijuana. GUTFELD: Oh terrible. PERINO: I'm kidding. What do I wish that's illegal? GUTFELD: You're going to get so much hate mail -- you're going to get so much hate mail from Lou Dobbs. PERINO: iPhone clicks. GUTFELD: iPhone clicks. PERINO: iPhone clicks should be illegal. GUTFELD: All right, Juan, what should be illegal? WILLIAMS: You know Greg, I've told you this repeatedly. I hate these people walking down the street and they're talking out loud and you think they're talking to you and in fact, they're talking on their phones. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: I think it's -- and then they jump into traffic or they bump into you because they're totally distracted. I think that should be like jaywalking or something. GUTFELD: I hate it when people use their kids as battering rams. You know, Trey, they're coming down the sidewalk. They got their kid in one of those baby strollers and they act like that has some kind of force field. Not to me. I'll walk right through them. I'll walk right through them, Trey. What do you wish was illegal? GOWDY: Lying, using a nom de plume on social media and lying about someone else with the intent to deceive others. GUTFELD: Very good, very good. Kennedy, what do you wish was illegal? MONTGOMERY: Well, Pierre Delecto, almost nothing. GUTFELD: There you go, a true libertarian, a true libertarian. I'm going to go with Trey and I'm going to go, you can't call somebody work and think on somebody because they said something you disagree with. You should go away for 10 years. If you call Fox News and say I complain because Greg says this, you go to jail for 10 years. How about that? All right, \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Greg? GUTFELD: I'm just going to plug stuff. Tomorrow night, \"THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" 10:00 p.m. I got Terry Schappert, Joe DiVito, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. That's Saturday 10:00 p.m., brand new, you're going to love it. My book The Plus entered the New York Times self-help number two, and number one in self-help in BookScan. I think that's what it's called. So massive hit, if you haven't bought it, I urge you to go to https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__GGutfeld.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=CIaadXG_7LqBukAvVt_WCWIswB5SBDWPiUddFbFl6uA&s=VS-Xx4AgNuvWr7oTk1vcj8XCkiN7l2rQp1pllhI74M0&e= . And also buy the remaining tickets at Yarmouth Drive-in Cape Cod where I will be appearing in front of 400 cars to do a show live. That's next Sunday. It's going to be awesome. PERINO: That's cool. WILLIAMS: Dana Perino. PERINO: That's a neat event. Exciting. OK, so in the not all heroes wear capes segment tonight, there was this 85-year-old man, his name is Kenneth Russell. He has dementia. And he went missing on Saturday near Calhoun, Louisiana. But there's great news because Zach Stephens is a man from nearby Monroe and his dog Ruby found him in the woods and now he is back with his family. Ruby is a bloodhound. He sniffed Russell out on Wednesday through sniffing one of his shoes. And it took her just 34 minutes to find him, which is amazing. So a job well done to Ruby. She got a spa day from a local business for all that so, nice story. WILLIAMS: That was a lifesaver, potentially. That's great. Well, I've got a special \"ONE MORE THING\" this Friday. This is special because there's really no need for me to say anything about this joyous moment. Take a look. The laughter is coming from Emma. Her mom, Erica Stubblefield put the video on social media. So far, 2.5 million people have joined in the laughter. Thanks, Emma, because I got a kick out of you. That was great. Trey, you're up. GOWDY: I want to thank the four of you for your hospitality. I also want to wish the kindest, sweetest, most beautiful person in the world happy 31st anniversary. GUTFELD: Thank you. GOWDY: I hope you -- I hope you like the weed eater and it's not too heavy. WILLIAMS: You didn't really give her a weed eater, did you? GOWDY: No, I gave her a leaf blower, to be honest with you. WILLIAMS: Oh, my God. All right, Kennedy, you're up. MONTGOMERY: Even better. All right, so one of the hardest things during the lockdown has been how do we give our pets exercise? Well, look at Gomez's human. She figured out a way to fasten a tennis ball to a tetherball setup. And Gomez just goes around and around in a circle as happy as can be. He's convinced he's going to catch that tennis ball at any moment. For those of you who know and love Boston Terriers, you know they have a lot of energy. I think this is a great set up and a lot of pet parents will be following suit. WILLIAMS: Pretty cool, Kennedy. That's it for us folks. Have a great summer weekend, everybody.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" July 28, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Alright. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy, busy Washington. Mollie Hemingway, Ben Shapiro, both will be here in moments to react to the abomination that was that Bill Barr hearing today. Also tonight, doctors vilified and censored for telling their COVID treatment stories. What's going on there? One of the doctors who organized yesterday's now infamous event is here exclusively. And Senator Josh Hawley takes apart big pharma - oh I can't wait for this - after one major drug company issued a threat after the President's executive order to lower drug prices. But first, berating Barr, befriending rioters, that's the focus of Tonight's Angle. Over the past month or so, the Angle has been telling you that there's virtually no distance between the mobs in Portland and Seattle trying to burn down federal buildings and the Democrats on Capitol Hill. And once again, they've proved our point. For several hours today, we saw the mobsters at work, but they weren't outside the building. They were inside, verbally, viciously attacking one of the most well respected legal minds in America, our Attorney General Bill Barr. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y.: Shame on you, Mr. Barr. WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Can I just say, Mr... NADLER: Shame on you. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, D-N.Y.: You have consistently undermined democracy, undermined the constitution and undermined the health, safety and well- being of the American people. REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND, D-LA.: When you all came here and brought your top staff, he brought no black people. That, sir, is systematic racism. REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: Your failure to respect the role of peaceful protest in this country is a disgrace. It's un-American. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-WA.: Mr. Barr, I just asked for a yes or no. So let me just tell you - I'm starting to lose my temper - this is my time and I control it. REP. STEVE COHEN, D-TENN.: I introduced H.Res. 1032 which would require this committee to investigate your conduct as Attorney General and determine whether you should be impeached. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: For the record, Barr's character, his reputation, his credentials are unimpeachable. I can't say the same for those folks. Now, I certainly couldn't say the same for any of the Democrat loud mouths hurling insults at him. Now, lest you forget what's been happening in major American cities, here's a reminder. (VIDEO PLAYING) INGRAHAM: The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee today however need you to see something very different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADLER: The protesters aren't mobs, they are mothers and veterans, mayors. COHEN: We've seen mothers and we've seen veterans who are peacefully protesting, not threatening the federal courthouse, beaten and gassed. CICILLINE: And the vast majority of the protesters are peaceful. REP. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL, D-FLA.: Most of the protests have been peaceful, Mr. Barr, you know that. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now we have right now in this country what appears to be a very organized effort by thousands of people across the country to create chaos and undermine our faith in the rule of law. And the Democrats, you watched them today, they just do not care. Now they're either wilfully and purposefully ignoring the dangers to our entire system or they're willing to let it all burn just to beat Donald Trump. Now, Barr who's seen a lot in his career could hardly believe what was on unfolding. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: Member of this committee, regardless of your political views, should condemn violence against federal officers. I see some of these Latin American countries in Central America where the police are very, very brave because the gangs they are trying to deal with go to their houses and kill their families. You never think that could happen here, but you could never think some of the stuff we're seeing today could ever happen here. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But it is happening here and it's happening because Democrat Mayors, Governors, Senators and those Congressmen have made a concerted decision to side with the very radicals who are threatening the lives of innocent Americans. They're doing it on interstate freeways, on bridges, in federal buildings, and frankly, anywhere where rioters gather. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: Since when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the Prettyman Court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the hill and started breaking windows and firing industrial grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in, and start fires in the court, is that okay? Is that okay now? No, the U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now, make no mistake, this is no longer the Democrat Party of Bill Clinton. It's not even the party of Barack Obama. This is the party of Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, the squad. This is the party of Antifa. This is the party of radical anarchists and revolutionaries who commit any crime against any person or any piece of property in order to get their way. And what's stunning to watch is that these domestic terrorists have become in their own way an active feature of the Biden campaign, got to keep up the chaos, try to provoke a reaction from federal law enforcement, all to affect the outcome of a Presidential Election. And Judiciary Committee Democrats are taking cues from these despicable people, performing for a television audience, attempting to carry out what was the equivalent of reputational assassination of Bill Barr. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MADELEINE DEAN, D-PA.: Have you now called for law enforcement to stop using these chemical irritants on protesters? Yes or no? BARR: Pepper spray? DEAN: Yes. BARR: No. DEAN: No? BARR: I think it's a very important non-lethal option. DEAN: For protesters? BARR: No, for rioters. DEAN: Sir, that was my question, for protesters. BARR: No, for rioters. DEAN: Yes. Sir, America was founded on the principles of free speech. BARR: When people resist law enforcement, they're not peaceful. DEAN: Reclaiming my time. I'm surprised at your lack of respect for a member of Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I laughed out loud in my kitchen when I saw that today. The gentle lady was treated with more deference in that exchange than she deserved. She took her five minutes to launch a personal attack on a man with an impeccable record. Like her colleague, she dissembled, distorted and demonized for purely political ends and her little charade for the cameras isn't just an example of conduct that is boorish and rude, but it's an insult to the integrity and history of the entire House of Representatives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POWELL: What am I supposed to say to my constituents when they ask me if the government has done everything in its power to protect their loved ones from dying? BARR: I would tell them that managing this kind of thing requires a lot of difficult choices, of weighing different consequences. (CROSSTALK) POWELL: I'm not going to lie. I am not going to lie to my constituents. I am going to tell them that President Donald Trump and the Attorney General working together are letting Americans die needlessly because of political reasons. (CROSSTALK) REP. MIKE JOHNSON, R-LA.: Is it permissible for a member of this committee to accuse a sitting Attorney General of the United States of murder, because that's what we just heard. NADLER: The members control the time. JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman, to say whatever they want? What about rules of decorum? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Rules of decorum? Those went unfortunately out the window a long time ago. And after all their preening and strutting and overcharged emoting, the Democrats sought to deprive Barr his one brief moment of humanity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: I have two children who are cancer survivors, so I feel very strongly about this issue as a matter of policy, and I believe that the President has made clear that he will ensure that they-- (CROSSTALK) REP. LUCY MCBATH, D-GA.: Sir, please answer my question, will you stop playing politics with Americans' health care in the middle of a pandemic? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Everyone should understand where we are. As mob violence consumes the country, we're in the middle of this COVID crisis, Democrats on Capitol Hill prefer to berate the chief law enforcement official in the country and float far left conspiracy theories rather than working with him to restore order and maybe just give people a little hope. And why are Democrats doing this? Why was there not a single reason question from even one of them today? Because they know that AOC and the squad will destroy them if they deviate from the far left playbook for just a millisecond. The Democrats are more terrified of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plus three because they're worried about her endorsing a primary challenger. They're worried more about that than what any reasonable American thinks. Ever since the impeachment effort failed, the Democrats have jumped on one crazy theory after another. Barr is a thoughtful and dedicated civil servant. He came out of retirement, not because he wanted something on his resume. He's already done everything. He did it because he has a profound sense of duty to this country. He and the American people deserve better. And don't imagine that Biden is going to stop the lawlessness in our cities, by the way, (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd be using local police as we did, when we were in office. When there were riots and our federal property at stake, we were able to take care of that and were able to take care of it by the use of (inaudible) obviously the use of local police. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh, really? Here's what Obama and Biden accomplished in Baltimore. (VIDEO PLAYING) INGRAHAM: They did nothing except let Baltimore and St. Louis, Ferguson burn, and electing Biden is going to make scenes like these play out in a neighborhood near you. And for those looking to, I don't know, for some comfort, some moderation, some sanity, Biden only offers an assurance to the far left and the AOC wing of his party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: If I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to be good to go down as the most progressive President in the American history. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Not bad. You're also going to be good to go down as one of the most manipulated and passive Presidents in American history. My goodness, think of Bill Barr and what he had to endure today and then think of Biden running the show, oh, sorry, whoever his Vice-President and the old Obama alums running the show. God help us, and that's the angle. Alright, joining me now is Ben Shapiro, Editor in Chief of The Daily Wire and author of \"How to Destroy America,\" we're seeing that play out. Also with me Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor. Ben, as loathsome as these characters on the left were at today's hearing, and also it really just showed us how intellectually morally bankrupt Democrats in Congress are right now. There is no decency. There's no dignity despite Biden invoking that word several times during his event today. BEN SHAPIRO, AUTHOR, HOW TO DESTROY AMERICA: It was a moral absurdity. The Democrats resembled nothing so much as a bunch of corgis attempting to strip a basketball while going after William Barr. It was just ridiculous from beginning to end. And the fact that Barr, who is a public servant, who has been around since the Reagan administration was treated this way, it's a good reminder that when President Trump says, \"They're not coming after me, they're coming after you\" to his supporters, he's right about that because Barr is generic arc (ph). He is not Donald Trump. He is just a normal run of the mill, very intelligent Republican conservative. And they went after him as though he were Donald Trump, which means they'll come after virtually anybody so long as that person opposes the radical left's agenda. INGRAHAM: Mollie, I think Ben's point is something that we have to state over and over again. So people take this away from Trump's tweets or his personality or he rubs you the wrong way sometimes. This is about the American people and how they tried to push around a man who is twice Attorney General of the United States. That's what they're going to do to the average - imagine what they'll do to the average citizen if they have the Justice Department back and all these federal agencies with investigatory power, imagine what they'll do. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Imagine what they'll do and also it's what they were unable to do with Barr because this is a man in full possession of his faculties. He's had a full professional career. He brings a lot of experience and wisdom and gravitas. He is a statesman. He is actually able to handle what Democrats are throwing at him. But if they are to turn their - that same sort of hate and viciousness against a typical Republican, I think a lot of people understand that's what they want to do and it's what they will do if they have more power. In many ways, what we saw today was probably the best example of the choice facing American voters. There is a group of Democrats, a large group of Democrats who are unwilling to condemn violence against federal buildings and federal law enforcement officers, destruction of city centers, arson, looting, assault. They're unable to condemn those things. In fact they defend those things and they instead attack the people who are attempting to restore law and order to these places. That is a very visceral choice facing American voters and that was on full display today. INGRAHAM: And this was Ben, I guess Nancy Pelosi came out today, and she had this as usual trenchant analysis of the Barr hearing today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: It demonstrated to the American people the contempt that he has for our democracy. He should be answering for what he did at Lafayette Square, a disgrace. So this is really, he was like a blob. He was like a just henchman for The President of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Henchman? Ben, she has now morphed into Ilhan Omar. I mean is there really any difference between Nancy Pelosi and any member of the squad, or frankly any member of Antifa? Really? I can't believe I'm saying this, but they're all one and the same. SHAPIRO: Yes. She was assimilated into the Borg last year when she refused to actually pass that resolution specifically condemning Ilhan Omar and then did a photo shoot with Ilhan Omar on the cover of Rolling Stone by the way. The innate ridiculousness of Nancy Pelosi claiming that Bill Barr is a threat to democracy, while simultaneously the entirety - virtually the entirety of the Democratic Party is claiming that federal law enforcement officers enforcing the law is military tyranny. It's ridiculous on its face and it's disgusting because again, they're saving their most rabid language for federal law enforcement officers. We've heard sitting Congress people on the Democratic side suggest that these people who are serving us and protecting us and standing between the villains and civilization, we've heard them called the Gestapo. We have heard them called tyrants. We we've heard the suggestion that they are in fact the threat in these cities. If that's the line they're going to pursue, I think sooner or later Americans are going to fight back against this, obviously non-violently. They're going to go to the ballot box and they're going to reflect the idea that most Americans are not willing to go along with their cities burning just to make Democrats feel good about themselves. INGRAHAM: Yes. That's why we are going to get to this later. That's why there's so much censorship from big tech. They don't want people to see the images that we're showing tonight on The Ingraham Angle. And Mollie, what got very little coverage of course is what Barr said, forcefully pushing back against claims that he's under pressure from The President in prosecutions or other criminal investigations. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: The President has not attempted to interfere in these decisions. On the contrary, he has told me from the start that he expects me to exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right and that is precisely what I've done. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Mollie, do remember anyone on the left charging Holder - Eric Holder with running interference even after he said - he actually said he was Obama's wingman. They weren't worried about that one bit. HEMINGWAY: They weren't at all. The reason why people don't like Attorney General William Barr is because he is attempting to hold people accountable for one of the most lawless things that has been done in the history of the country, if not the most - one of the most horrible things, which was this Russia collusion hoax, an attempt to take down the elected President of the country, to harm international relations, and to use it, to use all the tools of the intelligence services to do this. That was a horrible thing and Barr has said it clearly, and that's why they don't like him. But what's so galling about today is if you saw any pressure, it's not coming from people who are asking, it's not enough pressure coming from people who are asking for accountability. And it's all coming from people who are demanding that he stop, that he allow that lawlessness to continue, and that they be allowed to get away with what they did. And that is where the pressure is coming from. INGRAHAM: Yes, Ben and Mollie, they burned the Pfizer process, they burned the rule of law, they burned impeachment, all these investigations and now they will allow cities to burn, all to get rid of Trump. That has got to wake up the American voters. I certainly hope so. Both of you, your analysis tonight, so important. Thank you very much. And I had a tale of two liberal cities. Again, consumed by mayhem and their own leaders who seem completely unable or more accurately unwilling to stop the burning. In Seattle, an investigative journalist takes us inside how the city is going further than any other in bringing about the collapse of law and order. And in Chicago, we speak exclusively to the man who'll take on corrupt Cook County DA. You remember her; Kim Foxx. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Liberal cities across the country are being terrorized by chaos and lawlessness, especially in the Pacific Northwest. Now last night, we told you about the violence in Portland, a city that has looked like a scene out of Mad Max for the past two months. But tonight, we look at Seattle, the CHOP Autonomous Zone may be gone, but the radicals controlling the city are looking to continue its legacy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANGELICA CHAZARO, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: In order to actually transform the way the city does public safety, we need to shrink the current police force. KSHAMA SAWANT, COUNCILWOMAN, SEATTLE: We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state. MAYOR JENNY DURKAN, D-SEATTLE: It looks like this President is doing a dress rehearsal for martial law, sending in federal forces to take over police duties in city after city for political purposes. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now, my next guest says Seattle is going further than any other American city right now and deconstructing the entire justice system. The rule of law, it's shot there. Joining me now is Christopher Rufo, City Journal Contributing Editor. Now, Christopher, tell us what your sources and I know they're good, in the Seattle Police Department are confiding about what's really happening, the truth of what's happening in that city? CHRISTOPHER RUFO, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL: So right now, within the entire justice system in the city of Seattle, people are at a full blown panic. The Seattle City Council is currently deliberating a legislation to reduce the police force by 50%, which would have one of the lowest officers per capita of any large city if that happens. At the same time, the King County Executive Dow Constantine has pledged to close the Downtown jail and reduce the overall County jail capacity by 60% to 65%. It is just thing after thing after thing that the activists are pushing forward as we struggle with the COVID pandemic, as we struggle with this civil unrest. They're not waiting at all and their goal is very simple, abolish the police, abolish prisons and abolish the courts. INGRAHAM: So, again, the goal is clear. If that's what they want to do, the ends are going to mean complete destruction of life as we know it or knew it, I should say in Seattle. And Christopher, you got your hands on documents from King County's, it's called Zero Youth Detention Program, and they offer a template for Seattle's radical plan to abolish the prisons you just referenced. And that the document is full of ideas from critical race theory, including this page that describes white culture as \"individualism, meritocracy, progress and objectivity.\" Chris, doesn't it sound like it was written by a white supremacist there? Unbelievable. RUFO: Yes, there is a really increasingly fine line between old style racism and new style critical race theory. And what's happened is this, progressives have realized that the economic divide, classical Marxism is not a winning message. It has never worked anywhere it has been tried in the last century. So they've really grasped onto something that is unfortunately working much better for their aims, it's dividing people along racial lines and using the rhetoric of race to achieve the economic outcomes of Marxism. And Seattle is really ground zero and it's really astonishing, if you look at these documents, they're basically making the argument that the entire justice system is an institution of white supremacy, an institution of white domination, and the corrupt and evil racist culture, and the only solution for them, and this is at the highest levels of government, is to burn it all down. And that's what we're seeing not only in the streets, but we're seeing that in the boardrooms, in the decision-making centers, at the highest levels of government. It's really astonishing. And we haven't seen anything like this in recent history. INGRAHAM: Yes. I can tell you, Christopher, flyover country, those Midwestern states, swing states across this country - they better see that the coasts are collapsing in on them. If they think it's going to stay in Seattle, they haven't been paying attention. It's going to get worse under Biden because they're going to know what they're doing is working. Christopher, stay on this for us please and thank you for bringing us this story. Now, we traveled 2000 miles east of Seattle to Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot's exceedingly bad leadership is exacerbating the horrific crime wave there now sweeping the city in the wake of George Floyd's death. But the failure isn't Lightfoot's alone; it also rests with Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx. Now, that's right; that's a woman who refused to hold Jussie Smollett accountable for his hate crime hoax. She is now letting peaceful protesters who destroy and loot businesses off the hook. Why is she doing this? What's really her goal? Critics say she's refusing to uphold the rule of law because she wants a future in this new far left Democrat politics. Now, one of those critics and my next guest, Judge Pat O'Brien wants to derail her dangerous political ambitions. He joins me now and he's challenging her, Kim Foxx, for State's Attorney. Judge O'Brien, why is it so important in your mind that she be defeated in the next election? PATRICK O'BRIEN, R-STATE ATTORNEY CANDIDATE, COOK COUNTY: Laura, good evening and thank you. It's important because at this point, we're at a tipping stage where her policies are both corrupted and ineffective, and it seems like she's encouraging what we see on the streets, which is the blood of the innocent children that's running down and essentially the gangs and drugs controlling neighbourhoods; neighborhoods that she says she's protecting. So, the only thing we can do is to say \"Enough is enough, fire Kim Foxx\". INGRAHAM: Now, this is what Chicago police union president said on this show just a week ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN CATANZARA, PRESIDENT, CHICAGO FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE: There is a lot of people that were arrested with those guns that were immediately let back out on the street again. And it goes right back to Kim Foxx and the broken county jail system. I'm appealing directly to every voter in Cook County, Illinois, right now. You have a chance this November to take Kim Foxx out of office and do something worthwhile. She needs to go if we are going to get the city back away from the iceberg that the mayor has said it on a course with. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Judge O'Brien what's your message to the voters of Chicago this fall, especially those who are worried about the rule of law, race relations, all of it? O'BRIEN: Well, it's this, that you can't have turnstile justice, that you can't tell people that they can violate the law with impunity. They've got to be told that there are consequences for what, in fact, they do. There was no way that the neighborhoods are going to be safe, that victims are going to be protected if you turn your back on the law. The fact that she's running for an office that she doesn't have right now, which is to be on national stage, is just a crime, and the crime is Kim Foxx. INGRAHAM: Judge O'Brien, thank you so much, good to see you tonight. And up ahead, why is big pharma taking on Trump? Senator Josh Hawley takes them all on, and you don't want to miss it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Last week President Trump signed four very aggressive executive orders to slash drug prices, and as expected, big pharma, they are fighting back. Here is what the CEO of Pfizer said on an earnings call today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm disappointed by these executive orders. They pose enormous destruction at a time where the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment. We have plans to invest in both, R&D and manufacturing in the United States. If finalized, these new executive orders would force us to rescind those plans. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, Pfizer, of course, everyone knows is an amazing American company, but his grousing about profits is absurd. Last week HHS and the Pentagon announced that it would pay Pfizer and its German biotech partner $1.95 billion to produce 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine with the option of buying an additional 500 million doses, so you do the math they are. So there is no reason U.S. citizens should be paying more than other OECD countries for other drugs that Pfizer makes. That's the whole point of this executive order. The upcharge is absurd. Here to respond is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. Senator, you just heard the CEO of Pfizer essentially threatening to move manufacturing overseas because of these executive orders. What does this tell you? SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO.: It tells you that they are very interested in their profits and the gravy train that they've had going for years. Listen, I have no sympathy for big pharma whatsoever. They routinely charge Americans two and three and four times more for the same drugs that they charge patients in, say, Europe, France. And I know this is true because we have studies them. My home state of Missouri, they are charging people of Missouri three and four and five times more than they're charging folks in France or Germany and Canada. And I'm glad that the president is standing up to them. INGRAHAM: And I think, again, the money that is given by the drug companies to both political parties, it's astronomical. They are among the biggest donors to politics in the United States. And that's fine. That's what they do. But let's not all think this is all just charitable endeavors. It's a business, it's a company, but they have gotten a free ride. And I wanted to ask you, senator, about the president's decision, the administration's decision to give Kodak a boost in order to keep some medical manufacturing in the United States. There are a lot of conservatives out there, free marketeers, who would say we are playing favorites. And to that you say? HAWLEY: Well, I say, listen, it is important we manufacture as many pharmaceutical products as we can in this country. The fact that we manufacture so few drugs any longer, particularly drugs like insulin, we manufactured zero percent in this country. Major pharmaceutical products we've found because of the COVID-19 crisis that we are deeply dependent on foreign supply chains. So I think it is incumbent to look at all the options for bringing those supply chains back, for getting medical production back in this country. And to go back to big pharma, again, I don't have any sympathies for these guys. This big pharma, big government alliance has been great for big pharma. They have made a killing these last few years, really for decades. And it's time they start putting patients first. INGRAHAM: And Senator, a couple of weeks back, speaking of Biden, he said we should re-examine Trump's tariffs on China. Of course, that's the whole reason China came to the bargaining table in these trade deals. But today, Biden came out and pretended that he was going to be the one after four decades plus in Washington to put America first. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Using federal dollars that have already been appropriated, to focus them on building things that make us and increase our independence, so we don't have to rely on anyone else for, whether it's cyber security, cyber information. We have the capacity to do it at home. Do them at home. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK, Senator, is it my mistake or not, am I remembering this incorrectly -- wasn't he vice president in an administration for eight years? I must have missed all that work on these issues of bringing manufacturing back to the United States. HAWLEY: The problem with Joe Biden is that he is a classic China appeaser, and he has been his whole political career. He certainly was as vice president. Heck, even earlier this year he was questioning whether China was really a geostrategic threat. That turned out to be a little bit of a problem for him as we have seen with COVID-19, which is why he doesn't want to talk about those past statements now. But this is a guy who has never stood up to China. In fact, he has been all too eager to roll out the red carpet for China, give them whatever they want, sell out our jobs, sell out our workers. That's the problem. We're still cleaning up from his mess of years ago. And why would we go back to those failed policies? We don't need more appeasement. We need to get tough on China. This president started to do it. We need even more of that. INGRAHAM: Senator, I wouldn't let you get away without like you said this past weekend where you said, quite candidly, that you wouldn't support a Supreme Court nominee unless he or she had publicly stated before the nomination that Roe versus Wade was wrongly decided. Now, is that a litmus test that even some Republicans will back away from? What is your response? HAWLEY: You can call it whatever you want, Laura. I call it asking some basic questions about judicial philosophy. And I also call it the end of the trust us approach. For years conservatives, especially religious conservatives, let's be honest, have been told by the D.C. establishment just trust us. We'll pick good judges, just trust us. Don't ask too many questions, certainly don't ask about Roe. Just trust us. I'm through with that. I want to know, because Roe is absolutely central, Roe is an unbridled act of judicial imperialism. And if a nominee thinks that Roe was rightly decided, then he or she is a judicial imperialist and I'm not going to vote for him. INGRAHAM: We've still go to get Collins and Murkowski to sign on to any potential Supreme Court pick, but I would agree with you that if look at Roberts' record and even Gorsuch on some issues, and you wonder what the heck happened there. Trust but verify, I guess that's what you have to do. Senator, great to see you as always on these important issues. Thanks so much. And Twitter and Facebook are censoring anyone now who dares tout potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine. Now, my question is, does big tech have an M.D. after their vaunted brand names? And are they costing lives? Two doctors who have actually treated COVID patients with hydroxy including the one who organized yesterday's now viral press conference, they're here to respond. You don't want to miss this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have personally treated over 350 patients with COVID. And the result has been the same. I put them on hydroxychloroquine, I put them zinc, I put them on ZithroMax, and they are all well. I've not lost one patient. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If it seems like there is an orchestrated attack that's going on against hydroxychloroquine, it's because there is. When have you ever heard of a medication generating this degree of controversy? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But the M.D.'s at Twitter and Facebook have deemed those comments, heretical, dangerous. Twitter said the video violates its policies on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19, misinformation? Here's what one of the world's top epidemiologist told this show about hydroxychloroquine just last week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: You think thousands of lives could be saved going forward if they released that hydroxychloroquine stockpile and even gave it as a prophylactic for frontline workers, if they wanted it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think 75,000 to 100,000 lives will be saved if that happens. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskouithe cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in D.C. Also with me, Dr. Simone Gold, emergency medicine specialist. Dr. Gold, let's start with you. You organized this now viral event yesterday. What's your reaction to the anti-hydroxychloroquine censorship by big tech? DR. SIMONE GOLD, EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST: We come with a message of hope for the American people. The American people have been told that this is just something they need to have a lot of fear and a lot of panic over. And it's simply not true. There's a cure, there's treatment for early COVID disease, and that is hydroxychloroquine and zinc. It's very straightforward. It's easy. When you look at data from other countries, it's easy. We just don't have that kind of access here. And if anybody has any doubt that this is the answer, all they have to do is notice that YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook deleted all information about this. When did do a press conference, but we also had six hours of education from physicians explaining exactly why the drug works and going over all the safety and efficacy. They even took down our website. It's incredible. So somebody is really afraid of getting the truth. But I'm here to tell the American people hydroxychloroquine and zinc, we're going to get the information back up soon, America's frontline doctors. INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, here is the latest hydroxychloroquine hating from Dr. Fauci himself. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: The president promoting the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. We know the FDA has recommended against emergency use. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Exactly. And I go along with the FDA. The overwhelmingly, prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, what are the issues with the studies? There's one from Brazil that seem to be coloring Fauci and others' thinking on hydroxy, also the Boulware study. What is he talking about? DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST: What he is talking about is probably the most recent study out of Brazil that was referenced that came out last year in the New England Journal of Medicine. What it showed was when hydroxychloroquine given late, they couldn't tell whether it worked or not. And that's the study authors' own words. The reality is when given early in mild to moderate disease, hydroxychloroquine works terrifically well, and as we've seen, cuts mortality rate by 50 percent. INGRAHAM: But when we see the comments from mainstream media sources, Dr. Gold, I'm not going to say the word \"cure.\" I'm not a doctor, but I am going to say the passionate fight against a drug that's been around for 60 years is stunning. And the vitriol with which the critics launch their attacks, I've never seen anything like it. I don't know if Trump had never talked about it, if they'd feel differently, or if it's big pharma, or a combination, I don't know. But Dr. Gold, your group became persona non grata really quickly, really quickly. GOLD: You know what, Laura, I am a board certified practicing emergency physician. That's fine. We can take it. All of us can take it. But what we need to do, is we requested the FDA look at the emergency use authorization that's on their desk. We'd really like them just to allow us to use hydroxychloroquine, as we always were able to prior to COVID, and especially let us use it on-label now for COVID so that the states can stop restricting our usage of it. We really just want to heal patients and heal America. INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, a former Planned Parenthood president actually chimed in on hydroxy. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. LEANA WEN, FORMER PRESIDENT AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD: I really worry, Wolf, because there are so many millions of Americans for whom the president is their most trusted messenger. And when he starts saying things that go against science that are actually dangerous, I worry that Americans are going to go out, as they have before, and take this unproven medication. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: When I think of protecting lives, Dr. Oskoui, I think of Planned Parenthood. What's really frightening this woman? OSKOUI: I think what's frightening this woman is that there are numerous clinical trials that show that hydroxychloroquine works. And I think what she is afraid of is that this gets discovered by the American people. We never talk about the European data. We never talk about the mortality rates in countries that went to hydroxychloroquine early and aggressively. And that's something that should scare all of these people. Dr. Fauci is simply lying. INGRAHAM: Put that chart up. We actually have a chart. Put that chart up. We only have a few seconds. I wanted people to see that chart, where you see the countries on the right, early HCQ use, that's hydroxy use, very low rates of mortality and hospitalizations. Doctors, thank you very much. Up next, the Last Bite. It's a good one. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: OK, if you want proof that Stacey Abrams is no longer a top V.P. contender, listen to this one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We can't romanticize and say that if we do this, the world changes. It doesn't. There are no saviors running for reelection. There are no saviors running to save our country. Well, I want us to remember that this election is not about being excited about any single person. It's about being energized about our power to shape our future. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Biden better hope his voters have more enthusiasm for his run than she has.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his vice president. This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" August 11, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Big news in the political world, just hours ago, Joe Biden's handlers announced they have selected Senator Kamala Harris of California to run as Biden's Vice President. We will admit, we did not see this coming. In fact, just last night on the show, we told you that Susan Rice was likely to get that job. Rice is a hardened partisan, but she is not stupid, and more to the point, Rice has sincere beliefs whether you like them or not, and we don't. But Kamala Harris is the opposite of that. Harris may be the single most transactional human being in America. There are time-share salesmen you would trust more than Kamala Harris. You could find payday lenders who are more sincere. So it seemed inconceivable that given his current state, Joe Biden would choose someone so transparently one-dimensional as Kamala Harris. Someone as empty as he is. It would be the first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history and we thought it would never happen. But it is, they are doing it anyway. Biden-Harris, that's what they are going with, and the choice tells you a lot about the current state of the Democratic Party. America is still technically a democracy, yet neither Biden nor Harris has ever been popular with actual voters. This is Joe Biden's third run for President. The first two attempts ended in embarrassing disasters. The third was headed at high speed in that direction, and then a series of unforeseen flukes and a highly crowded primary field left Biden the last man in the race. He was clearly shocked by his own victory. On election night, the night he clinched the nomination in March, Biden was so rattled he mistook his sister for his wife during the acceptance speech. At the time, Joe Biden's relative unpopularity seemed like a major problem for Democrats. This is politics, after all. The people who tend to have the most support tend to win. So if you're choosing a presidential nominee, you think you'd want someone with a built-in constituency, a base of passionate voters you can count on Election Day, but as it turns out, that is the last thing the leaders of the modern Democratic Party wanted. They already had a candidate like that, in fact, his name was Bernie Sanders and they did everything they could to stop him. No. What they wanted instead with someone they could control and Joe Biden fit that description perfectly. Biden was eager, malleable, and totally blank. He was willing to be whatever his handlers wanted him to be. Kamala Harris will be every bit as eager and that's the point. If Biden-Harris to doesn't make sense to you as a ticket, it's only because you are not cynical enough. Harris clearly wasn't picked for her personal charm. More than 30 years ago, she dated a man called Willie Brown who was later the mayor of San Francisco. She was 29 years old at the time, Brown was 60 and still married. Brown launched Harris's political career. He knows her very well. Last week Brown publicly urged Joe Biden not to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. But it turns out, Willie Brown's opinion no longer matters in the Democratic Party, Jeff Bezos' opinion matters, so do the opinions of his fellow Bay Area tech titans and the finance moguls in New York. These are the people who bankroll the Democratic Party. They are the economic engine of the left, and they love Kamala Harris, not personally. It's business. Their main interest is in keeping the government carve outs that have made them rich. They know the last thing Kamala Harris will do is threaten any of those, never, under any circumstances. One thing you can be certain of, in a Biden-Harris administration, private equity barons will still pay half the tax rate you pay, and that's the real point. Voters may not like Kamala Harris, but Wall Street does -- just in case you're wondering who is actually in charge. And yet still, even politicians have souls -- technically anyway. So how could Joe Biden pick a running mate who once publicly denounced him as racist? You remember the moment. It was in the debate last summer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): I am going to be now direct this to Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist. But you also worked with them to oppose busing. And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I do not believe you are a racist. I do not believe you beat your wife. Right. Kamala Harris, Civil Rights icon. Actually, Harris group mostly in Canada. And in any case, forced busing was a disaster from the beginning to the end. Nobody liked it, including black families. Joe Biden may be a bigot but it's not because he opposed forced busing. But, apparently he has forgiven Harris for that slur. Maybe he doesn't member it. Even a dimming 77-year-old must have some memory of what Harris once said about his purported sex crimes. Just last year, several women came forward to say Joe Biden had touched them in sexually aggressive ways, both on and off camera. Kamala Harris wholeheartedly endorsed their claims, quote, \"I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it.\" Wait, what? You believe that Joe Biden sexually assaulted a number of women, sexually assaulted them, but you're joining his presidential ticket anyway? How does that work exactly? How can you do that? Well, as it turns out, she can do it happily, shamelessly without even taking a breath. Just tell Kamala Harris what to say and she will say it. That is the whole point of Kamala Harris. It's why she is so useful. And for the next several months, Harris is going to say that Donald Trump is a racist. She will say that every day until November. That's her job now. You watch. But keep in mind, as you watch that there's no fighting back. It's not allowed. Kamala Harris is a quote, \"historic\" candidate and that means you have no right to criticize her regardless of what she says. They are already telling you that. They are making it very clear. Just last week, a group of abortion lobbyists, officials from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, EMILY's List and others sent a letter to media organizations around the country about Biden's upcoming VP pick. It was addressed to editors, news directors, reporters. The choice of the vice presidential candidate was most certain to be a black woman, they said, they were right, and they wanted to warn reporters that in the wake of George Floyd's death, any critical coverage of Joe Biden's VP pick what amount to quote, \"systemic racism.\" That wasn't guidance. It was an unveiled threat. They made it because they knew it would work and in fact, it's already working. Immediately after Harris was chosen today, \"The New York Times\" sent out a bulletin describing her as quote, \"a pragmatic moderate.\" Got that? A pragmatic moderate, not some kind of cookie ideologue, not some flaky lifestyle liberal from San Francisco. Not at all, no. Instead, someone who wants to solve America's toughest problems, and solve them without regard to orthodoxy or partisanship. A sober, steady leader in troubled times. Actually, it might be nice to have someone like that. But that is not Kamala Harris, not even close. Harris has endorsed forcing schools to let biological males play in girls' athletic teams. It's not a majority position. It is nuts, but it's not as crazy as federally subsidized abortions for biological men. Harris is for that, too. She has announced it. Think that through for a minute. Men can't get pregnant, so how do we pay for their abortions? Harris has never explained that of course, at this point, it would be systemically racist to ask her, so no one ever will ask her. Shut up. No questions allowed. Meanwhile there is not a fashionable rich lady position that Kamala Harris doesn't have. Plastic straws are bad. Red meat is worse. If there was a bill to make soul cycle mandatory, Kamala Harris would get behind it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: Do you ban plastic straws? HARRIS: I think we should, yes. QUESTION: But would you support changing the dietary guidelines? HARRIS: Yes. QUESTION: You know, the food pyramid? HARRIS: Yes, yes. QUESTION: To reduce red meat specifically. HARRIS: Yes, I would. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So now you know Kamala Harris' position on the all-important F.D.A. food pyramid, but she has non-frivolous positions on important topics, too. On healthcare, Harris believes that illegal immigrants have every bit the right to taxpayer-funded medical treatment that you do as a citizen. This is yet another position, whatever you think of it, that the majority of Americans do not support. But as we have noted, Harris doesn't care what most people want. They are not her audience. She is told to support free healthcare for foreign nationals who break our laws, and so she does support it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Do you support giving universal healthcare and Medicare-for-All to people who are in this country illegally? HARRIS: Let me just be very clear about this. I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education or public health. Period. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So, Kamala Harris isn't an idiot and she knows what she just suggested is actually impossible. You can have a welfare state, lots of countries do. You can have open borders. But you can't have both. No country can survive with a welfare state and open borders. That's obvious. No one disputes it. But Kamala Harris doesn't care either way. The survival she cares about his or her own survival. By the way, if you think you can keep your family safe as a country collapses around her ambitions, you are wrong because she plans to disarm you first. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: Do you believe in the mandatory buyback of quote-unquote \"assault weapons\"? HARRIS: I do believe that we need to do buybacks, and I'll tell you why. They are weapons of war with no place on the streets of a civil society. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: We could go on and on. Oh, the ironies. A party that is angry about police brutality has just hired the former chief law enforcement officer of California. Again, there's a lot to say and in coming weeks, we'll say it. There is a lot of available tape and of course, Harris will soon provide more. But we are going to sum up Kamala Harris this way. Last year when actor, Jussie Smollett staged his fake hate crime, Harris was one of the first national leaders to jump in with an expression of support. Smollett was quote, \"The kindest, most gentle human being\" Harris had ever met, she wrote. The attack on him was quote, \"an attempted modern-day lynching.\" Okay, so, she fell for it. Lots of credulous rich people did. But what makes Kamala Harris a remarkable figure is that in the face of changing evidence, she never recanted her support. That tweet is still up. She did not delete it. You can still read it on her Twitter feed tonight. Smollett's story was entirely concocted. Harris knows that. We all know it, but she doesn't care. In fact, Harris understands perfectly well why Smollett lied. By smearing Trump supporters as bigots, he hoped to advance his career, and Kamala Harris, of all people, can respect it. Richard Goodstein served as adviser to the Clintons. He is watching all of this very carefully. He joins us tonight. Richard, I always preface my questions to you by saying, I don't want to be mean, but how can someone who said she believed that Joe Biden committed sexual assault against various women serve as his running mate? Sincere question. RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Tucker, can I just say one quick thing because this is something that will serve you and your fellow hosts on Fox. Her name is pronounced comma, like the punctuation mark -- Kamala. CARLSON: Okay. GOODSTEIN: Seriously, I've heard every sort of -- CARLSON: Okay, so what? GOODSTEIN: That's how it is. Kamala. Well, I think it's out of a respect for somebody who is going to be on the national ticket, pronouncing her name right is actually -- is kind of a bare minimum, that's all. CARLSON: Okay, so I'm disrespecting her by mispronouncing her name unintentionally. So it begins, you're not allowed to criticize Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris or whatever. GOODSTEIN: Kamala, no, no, no. CARLSON: Because -- Kamala Harris -- GOODSTEIN: It's not whatever. CARLSON: Okay, look, I unintentionally mispronounced her name. GOODSTEIN: Let me ask you a question. CARLSON: But I love the idea that she is immune from criticism, so let me restate my question. GOODSTEIN: Let me answer -- no, no. CARLSON: Because on this show, nobody in power is immune from criticism. Our political leaders must be held to account. That's our job. And so my question to you remains the same. How can a person who said she believed Joe Biden committed sexual assault serve as his running mate? Simple, regardless of how her name is pronounced. GOODSTEIN: Right. And I will believe that you or others who are interested in politicians committing sexual assault are serious about it when they put a smidgen of the attention into Donald Trump grabbing people by the genitals, then he brags about -- CARLSON: You're missing it. You're totally missing it. On this show -- hold on. I defended Joe Biden. I don't think the accusations are real against him. I'm like the only conservative on TV who said that. GOODSTEIN: Exactly. CARLSON: So I am not attacking Joe Biden on the basis of that. I'm attacking him for his ideas, which are wrong. Joe Biden was attacked by Kamala Harris and if she sincerely believed that, how can she serve as his running mate? It is really simple. It has got nothing to do with Trump. GOODSTEIN: Yes. Kamala Harris said about Bret Kavanaugh and everybody else what matters are the facts, and the facts in this case are that the one witness who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault has been radically discredited and that's basically her position and that's where the public has come down on this. That's why for months, you haven't heard a word about this and in part because you've got 20 women waiting to get their position in court taking their case against Donald Trump, and I guess, maybe in fair and balance- hood, you know, maybe you don't really want to go down that road. That's all. CARLSON: No, no. It's a very simple road. I don't work for any politician. If somebody accuses you of a crime and then never says she recants and doesn't believe you're guilty, then maybe she shouldn't serve as your vice presidential nominee. That's all I'm saying. It's not about Trump. GOODSTEIN: It's the facts. The facts matter. CARLSON: This is the one thing that's not about -- okay, okay. Let me ask you this. GOODSTEIN: Okay. CARLSON: Name three things that Kamala Harris sincerely believes. Issues on which she will not change her view, policy issues, if you would. Just as a baseline. GOODSTEIN: A fundamental thing, so Joe Biden is running for President. It's his positions, just like Mike Pence took the position with Donald Trump, not believing that grabbing women was a good thing, but he otherwise thought that Donald Trump was onto something. And Joe Biden is on to making sure that things are done more fairly in the country and not tilted towards the rich and powerful. Kamala Harris believes that. She did that as Attorney General. CARLSON: Oh really. GOODSTEIN: She did as a DA in San Francisco, yes, indeed. CARLSON: Okay, so I'm wondering, will they get rid of the carried interest loophole that allows private equity moguls to pay half the tax rate that the rest of us wage earners pay? I don't see them eager to do that. If you wanted to make the country fair, you would change the Tax Code, but they are servants of Wall Street, so they won't. So the lecture on fairness is a tiny bit nauseating, no? GOODSTEIN: Actually, I think they are talking about changing the Tax Code to tilt it toward the middle class and away from bias again towards the rich. And if carried interest is part of that, I think that we all get swept up in it. CARLSON: What do you mean, if it's part of that? GOODSTEIN: Yes, I wouldn't be surprised. CARLSON: It's a scam and everyone knows it's a scam, but of course, they never will because their donors are -- how can a ticket supported primarily by the tech moguls and Wall Street fight for economic fairness? Sincere question. GOODSTEIN: Tucker, Donald Trump had the House, the Senate, and the White House for two years and did nothing against carried interest, and you're complaining about Joe Biden's position on it? Please. CARLSON: He should have. No, no, hold on. I know you want to make everything about Trump. We spend a lot of time talking about Trump in the American media. Today, Joe Biden chose Senator Harris of California as his running mate. You said her main commitment was to fairness. It's clear that the Tax Code is not fair. GOODSTEIN: Yes. CARLSON: So in what way specifically where they change -- I mean, I don't mean yelping about BLM, getting off cheap and easy. I mean, the real change. GOODSTEIN: It's not yelping. CARLSON: What are they for? GOODSTEIN: So, it's not yelping to be for tax fairness, to be for racial justice. Most people in the country don't think our President supports racial justice. The people -- the reason why black voters -- CARLSON: It costs Kamala Harris' donors nothing to talk about racial justice. He would cost them something if they stopped getting special carve outs from the Congress. Will they work to change those? GOODSTEIN: Again, Joe Biden is the nominee. There's a reason that black voters overwhelmingly voted for him in the primaries and support him in the polls, because he is clearly for racial justice and so is she. That's not even questionable. I'm surprised that you -- that's a kind of an argument you want to pick. Seriously. CARLSON: No. What I am talking about is a thing that nobody ever talks about which is economic justice. All of this is a cover designed to keep us from talking about it. But I'm going to talk about it because I think it matters and these are the candidates of business. Period. Unfortunately. Richard, great to see you. GOODSTEIN: Well, I don't think that's a product you're going to see, but we will see as the months unfold. CARLSON: You may be right. They may not see it, but it doesn't make it less true. GOODSTEIN: Yes. CARLSON: Thanks. Dana Perino is a host of \"The Daily Briefing.\" It airs weekdays at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. She joins us now. I'm not going to attempt to pronounce Senator Harris' name ever again because I don't want to be accused of showing disrespect, which I'm not. DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Okay. CARLSON: But, I wonder if you think this is a wise choice as an electoral matter. PERINO: I feel like it is a -- believe it or not, I do think that out of all the choices, when I read through all of the bios this weekend, I came to the conclusion that she probably made the most logical sense for him. If you look at some of the other candidates, for example you mentioned Susan Rice at the top of the show that you thought maybe she would be getting it. CARLSON: Yes, I did. PERINO: I looked at that and I thought there's several reasons I thought she would be not a good choice for the vice presidential nod. I think if Biden trusts her and appreciates her approach to things, she might make a good Chief of Staff for him if he were to become the President. But she would make a very bad candidate. The thing about Kamala Harris is all of these policy positions, like for example, you didn't have a chance to mention with Richard, she said that she was against -- that she has for banning all fracking. That is not Biden's position. So, she will have to figure out a way to support Joe Biden on that thing. But there's a lot of questions she is going to be asked. If you remember, when she said she was for Medicare-for-All and she also went a step further and said she was for getting rid of private health insurance. That really was the beginning of the end of her campaign. She never really recovered from that stumble. CARLSON: Right, I remember. PERINO: In addition, she had a hard time connecting with voters. Now, I do think that she is going to get a fresh look especially the media. Right? The media will help a little bit and Democratic voters will have to decide, do they like Kamala Harris enough? Did she inspire them enough for them to continue to want to support Joe Biden as much as they want to vote Donald Trump out? I don't know how many people are going to say, I am definitely going to vote for Biden now just because he chose Kamala Harris. But a safe choice for him at this point, I think. CARLSON: Very quick. Countries obviously completely out of money, people want more federally subsidized healthcare. Will the Biden campaign stick with their position that we need to extend federally subsidized healthcare to people who are here illegally? PERINO: Well, they have said that they would. If they backtrack on that, I think that that would be, yet again another thing for the progressives of the party, right, that were really driving a lot of that primary charge where you saw all of these candidates move to the left. And Biden really hasn't tacked more to the center since he wrapped up the primary and the nomination. He has really kind of continued to try to win over that progressive left. Kamala Harris, I think, one of the things that I heard in the focus groups, one of the words used to describe her often was \"inauthentic.\" So can she reintroduce herself to America and especially Democratic voters, and be more authentic and still hold on to some of those positions or flip flop on them? I think that remains to be seen. But I do think after like three or four days, everyone is going to focus on the fact that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are the two candidates. Pence and Kamala Harris, important, but footnotes in the story. CARLSON: Probably true. Dana Perino, thanks so much for that. PERINO: Okay. Bye-bye. CARLSON: Nothing makes politicians madder than when you don't obey them. In one state, not wearing a face mask could put you on the hook for attempted murder. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Our elected leaders have changed their views on whether you need a mask so often that it's hard to keep track. Most people have decided just to ignore the yelping, and that makes politicians very angry. You can disagree, but you can't ignore them. That may be why the Director of Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources is now commanding that government workers wear masks even when they are alone at home on a teleconference. The Director is a man called Preston Cole and that he says that wearing a mask alone at home sets an example that shows you quote, \"care about the safety and health of others.\" Even if there are no others and you're by yourself. Wearing a mask will keep you from infecting yourself with the coronavirus. Meanwhile in the State of Tennessee, a Councilwoman called Sharon Hurt from Nashville believes you should face attempted murder charges if you don't wear a mask. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHARON HURT, COUNCILWOMAN, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE: You know, I work for an organization that if they pass a virus, then they are tried for murder or attempted murder if they are not told. Maybe there needs to be stronger legislation to say that if you do not wear a mask and you subject exposure of this virus to someone else, then there will be some stronger penalty as it is in other viruses that are exposed. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Some stronger penalties. Also, we should simply execute people who don't wear masks for the sake of public health. That may be up for discussion soon. Meanwhile, at the University of Georgia, the university has posted so- called medical advice that students should wear a mask, a medical facemask while having sex. They cited the Mayo Clinic for that. The school later removed the post after a much-deserved mockery online. So, should we be wearing masks home alone or while having sex? Dr. Scott Atlas has thought about this. He is a member of the White House Coronavirus Taskforce. He joins us tonight. Dr. Atlas, thanks so much for coming on. DR. SCOTT ATLAS, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASKFORCE MEMBER: Hi, Tucker. Sure. Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: So, as a man of science, if you could just explain the public health utility of wearing a mask home alone on a Zoom call. Is the virus transmissible through Zoom? ATLAS: No. And by the way, I want to correct you. I've not thought a lot about wearing a mask while having sex. I want to correct that. CARLSON: I was trying to do it with a straight face and I couldn't. ATLAS: Well, you know, the reality is that there is certain date that is very controversial about masks and I think the President said it correctly honestly when he said that in certain settings, it's reasonable to wear a mask when you cannot social distance and particularly if you're trying to protect -- in proximity to high-risk individual or you are a high-risk individual, and I think that's a rational policy. I don't want to make fun of people who say these other things, though, and the reality is it is stemming from a massive amount of fear bordering on hysteria now, and this is a real problem because public policy is supposed to be taken into consideration, not just stopping COVID-19 at all cost, but understanding the impact of people on what you do and what you say. I think that's been a failure in some of the people who have been speaking out on this. CARLSON: Well, fear has its political uses. That may explain it in part, but fear also has medical consequences, does it not? It's not good for people to be terrified, filled with anxiety, is it? ATLAS: Well, that's absolutely true and it also, again, you know, we need to live in a rational world. We need to show our children to use critical thinking. There's been a lot of sloppy thinking as I've said many times about people with very fancy CVs on this stuff. But reality is, you know, there are reasons to wear a mask. But generally speaking, you know, driving around in your car alone and some of the other scenarios you outlined is not really rational to wear a mask. CARLSON: You see people running outside with no one around them or riding their bikes outside and wearing masks, and you kind of appreciate the effort they're putting in and the suffering they're going through while doing it. But is there science behind that decision? Is there a good reason to do that? ATLAS: You know, there's no real good science on general population, widespread in all circumstances wearing masks, and that really has been sort of a failure of communication by people who are supposed to know better. When you look at an article that's published, you're not supposed to take the bottom line. You're actually supposed to look at it critically as a medical scientist and try to understand if you can actually draw the legitimate conclusion that the authors themselves are drawing. And much of the stuff on masks really is not very good science at all and in fact, the W.H.O. itself says there is no sound science for general populations wearing masks. However, in certain settings, I think we can say it's reasonable to wear a mask, and the whole public policy honestly is twofold here. The public policy is directly for stopping the deaths by protecting the high-risk people and preventing hospital overcrowding while you safely reopen society. The public policy is absolutely not just stop COVID-19 cases at all cost no matter what. That is not appropriate policy. CARLSON: And finally, you have seen a couple of high-profile people pass away from the coronavirus, from COVID-19, and you have seen media stories gleefully mocking their deaths. This is true for Herman Cain, a very nice man by the way. He died because he had doubted the mask policy, therefore the media concluded he deserved to die. Is this a standard that you accept, that we mock people after they die? And should we apply it to other communicable diseases? That people somehow deserve to die if they don't follow the rules? ATLAS: Yes, I mean, obviously, that's totally inappropriate. It's sort of a symptom of both fear and honestly your profession, not you, but your profession ... CARLSON: Yes, I know. ATLAS: \u00a0... that has really highlighted and sensationalized things way out of proportion, and I'm not sure if it's just a sign of the times or we are living in this hyperbole of social media or if there are other motivations. But really, it's up to people who are legitimate credible medical scientists to step up and articulate the logic and commonsense policy because you can't just say it's all about the science and then say things that are contrary to the science. CARLSON: I think that's a very smart point, because no one believes you and you devalue your own credibility. I think that's really wise. Dr. Atlas, thank you. ATLAS: Okay, thanks for having me. CARLSON: Reporters from \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" totally destroyed the life of an administration staffer. They did it deliberately. She survived and she is here to explain what happened and why. She's got a new book. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Just a year ago, Madeleine Westerhout was serving as Director of Oval Office Operations for the President, seated right outside his office. Then she went on a trip, a state trip and her life was ruined by reporters who published her off the record comments after a few drinks about the President's daughters. So she has left the White House, and now she has written a book. It's called \"Off the Record: My Dream Job at the White House, How I Lost it and What I Learned.\" Madeleine Westerhout joins us tonight. Madeleine, thanks so much for coming on. Congrats on the book. This was one of those stories that -- MADELEINE WESTERHOUT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF OVAL OFFICE OPERATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, I had run into you in Washington and I thought you seemed unlike a lot of people in the political world, like a genuinely nice person, so I watched this and it made me sad to see it. WESTERHOUT: Thank you. CARLSON: But summarize the book. Why did you get destroyed? What did you learn? WESTERHOUT: Yes, so you know I had a bad night. I made a mistake that cost me my job. I said some things I shouldn't have said after too many drinks. But how what I said got back to the -- what I said off the record dinner got back to the President and ultimately made headlines is beyond me. I don't know who gained anything from the story. I certainly didn't. I don't think the President did. I don't think his family did and I am pretty sure the American people didn't. CARLSON: So, I mean, people who cover politics know that at the end of most of days on the road, there's an off the record dinner between political people and reporters and nothing that's said gets leaked. The rules have changed. A guy called Phil Rucker from \"The Washington Post\" apparently is one of the people who broke the rules in order to hurt you. Why do you think they did this? WESTERHOUT: You know what? I think they did this to hurt the President. I don't think they cared about me at all, but they did care the President. They cared about hurting him and that's exactly what they did by sharing the information and I have decided over the last year that it is honestly no longer worth my time to question how these comments got shared. But I will ask a broader question which is, what does off the record even mean anymore? CARLSON: Right. Do you wish you hadn't trusted members of the National Press Corps? Rhetorical question. WESTERHOUT: Of course, yes, absolutely. CARLSON: I mean, I guess just to put a finer point on it, the irony of your story is this is a White House, if we are being honest that has a number of people in high positions who are leaking against the guy they work for. Who aren't actually on board with his program? You were one of the people who actually liked him and agreed with him. WESTERHOUT: I did. CARLSON: So, it's a little weird that you got destroyed. WESTERHOUT: Yes, and like I said and I talk about it in my book, I made a mistake and I think that's really relatable. I think a lot of Americans, and a lot of people, we all make mistakes. Mine just happened to play out on the world's largest stage. So, it's been an interesting year for sure. CARLSON: Did any of the reporters who betrayed your trust and broke the age-old law of off-the-record rule ever call you to apologize? WESTERHOUT: I spoke to a couple of the reporters that were at that dinner and they expressed their empathy for how things kind of unfolded. But no, I did not hear directly from any of the reporters that I think you're referring to. CARLSON: Did it occur to you since at these dinners, you know, most people are drinking and people's tongues are loosened to call their bosses and tell them off the record things that they had said, see if you could get them fired from their jobs. Did you consider doing that? WESTERHOUT: I didn't. I wish I had. CARLSON: Oh, you're not a bad person. Right, okay. WESTERHOUT: Well, and you know what, I'm not going to go up against the Amazon \"Washington Post.\" CARLSON: Yes, no it's a really good point. Jeff Bezos' newspaper. I hope, he is proud. Madeleine Westerhout, congratulations on the book. It is great to see you tonight. Glad you're back. WESTERHOUT: Thanks, Tucker, for having me. Thanks. CARLSON: Thanks a million. Joe Biden isn't as good a panderer as he was. Kamala Harris is on the scene, though, and we have amazing video and we will show you just how good she is at it. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Joe Biden may not always recognize his own wife, but he has not forgotten how to pander to voters. That's an ingrained skill gained over 50 years. Here he is on a videoconference with Muslim activists. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Muslim communities are the first to feel Donald Trump's assault on black and brown communities in this country with his vile Muslim ban. Under this administration, we have seen unconscionable -- an unconscionable rise in Islamic-phobia. The incidents including kids being bullied in school and hate crimes in our communities. If I have the honor of being President, I will end the Muslim ban on day one -- day one. Thank you so, so very much, and may peace be upon you. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I bet you didn't know we had a Muslim ban. Oh, because we don't. But here's something really surprising. Joe Biden, after a lifetime on the left now supports bringing religion back into schools. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a former Muslim, author of the book \"Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now,\" and one of our all-time favorite guests. We are honored to have her tonight. Ayaan, thanks so much for coming on. So how do you assess -- most people have not seen this video. I'm interested in your thoughts as someone who is deeply learned on this subject. What do you take from this? AYAAN HIRSI ALI, RESEARCH FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I mean, you go -- by the way, Tucker, hi. Nice to see you again and thank you for having me on. But when you go to the next sentence, the next thing that he says in the clip which is if you see something wrong and he quotes the Prophet Mohammed, then use your hand and if you can't use your hand, use your tongue and if you can't use your tongue, then use your heart. What he is basically doing from that point onwards is enforcing Sharia Law and it is vigilantism on steroids. It is like, you know, we have seen if you are a Muslim, you grew up within Islam, you're trying to reform it. You're a just a good American Muslim, you are being confronted with a former Vice President and I would say a candidates for a major political party who is basically saying let's enforce Sharia Law. I have absolutely nothing against -- and I am with him on let's fight discrimination. We should not be bullying Muslim children. We shouldn't be doing any of that. He is really good on that, but I don't know who puts these words in his mouth, and I'm alarmed. CARLSON: So, as a garden-variety Protestant, this went right over my head. I didn't catch any of it. I didn't even notice. Would this be obviously to people who grew up reading the Quran? ALI: Yes. I watched that video, I mean, all of it. Not just where you stopped, but where I think there is this concept called commanding right and forbidding wrong. And I absolutely cannot believe that in the year 2020, Joe Biden is commanding right and forbidding wrong. Meaning, he is enforcing Sharia Law. I understand that Joe Biden doesn't know what he is doing, because -- and I think most Americans don't. But he does have a campaign team. He has a team of people who will say this is what you can say, and here is why. This is what I think is. Your former guest said she is sorry when she made a gaffe. This is something I think because we're in this cancel culture and I am absolutely against cancel culture, but this is -- here is one thing where I would say Joe Biden should come out and apologize and apologize profusely to the American people, and especially to those American Muslims who have adopted and embraced the foundational principles of America. In this video, what he has done is he has put himself, at least these people who I think of as the Muslim Brotherhood, radical Islamists, they have him endorsing and enforcing Sharia vigilantism. I mean, think about it. You have people who -- Muslims scholars, when they start talking about enforcing Sharia Law, it is \"Should we use\" when you talk about the hand, is it the sword? Is it firearms? Is it improvised explosive devices? Think about the two brothers who went and used their mother's pressure cooker to hurt people during the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. That's the kind of thing. And if you don't know what you're talking about, then you shouldn't do it. But if you do, I think it would be a great trait of leadership if then Joe Biden came out and said I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I didn't realize this is what I was doing. If he did that, I'd vote for him. CARLSON: Do you think there's any chance that he will do that? ALI: Here we go, because you are trying to -- he is trying to harvest every single kind of vote he can get, but if he is so desperate as to want the vote of the organized Muslim Brotherhood, then I think we are in big trouble and I don't know if he will do it. CARLSON: Very quickly, how did these words get into his script? Do you have an idea who advised him to say that? ALI: I don't know who did that. I know this group of people called -- this guy who put the video together and who lured him into saying these things, I know that they are parts of the organized Islamist group. We call them the Muslim Brotherhood, those of us who are following these sorts of things. But what I do know is that the people who look after him, the campaign team were not on red alert and that they didn't stop him from saying this type of thing. CARLSON: Yes, clearly. ALI: And we all live in the age of cancel culture -- they didn't -- we live in the age of cancel culture and I would say to you, it would be a great trait of leadership of Joe Biden's campaign team came out today and said no, we made a big mistake. We obviously don't understand Sharia Law. We don't understand the ins and outs of it, but we -- this is wrong and this is not what we are about. CARLSON: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, thank you so much for that. Again, I missed it. But I was glad to hear it. Thank you. ALI: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Voters in Massachusetts will have to replace the only Kennedy still in Congress. The likely successor has an only in America success story, but with a twist. That's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Since 1947, just after the Second World War, a member of the Kennedy family has represented the State of Massachusetts more or less continuously, but that streak is finally ending. Congressman Joe Kennedy retires this year and honestly, I don't want to be mean, but his potential replacements do not seem quite worthy of the family name. None has tried to start another world war. None has left a woman to drown alone in a car -- but they are trying. One of the candidates this year is a woman called Ihssane Leckey. We will say this for her, she is every bit as shameless as the man she is replacing. Here's her new ad. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IHSSANE LECKEY, CANDIDATE FOR MASSACHUSETTS' 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT: \u00a0My name is Ihssane Leckey. I'm running for Congress in Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District. I was born in morocco to a public school teacher and a farmer. I came to this country believing in the American dream, of starting from nothing and becoming successful. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Got that? Born in North Africa to a striving family, came to the United States, became successful. It's a great story. In fact, it's the American dream. So how does Leckey feel about the country that made it possible? Yesterday she wrote this on Twitter quote, \"Now, I'm running for Congress to dismantle every oppressive system that denies us the basic necessities to live.\" End quote. In other words, I came to America. My life improved dramatically. I'm not grateful. In fact, I despise your country so much I want to quote, \"dismantle your systems.\" That's her platform. It is hard to believe there's a market for that -- for that kind of ingratitude, but obviously there is. Ilhan Omar is still in Congress. The well of progressive self-loathing turns out to be bottomless and unfortunately when you despise yourself, it's pretty easy to despise your country. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that's the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. And if you think that's great, wait until you see what happens now at 9:00 p.m. from New York, Sean Hannity. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Multiple sources confirmed to Fox News that President Trump intends to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Justice Ginsburg in the Supreme Court. President Trump plans to announce that Amy Coney Barrett will be his nominee to the Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, multiple sources told Fox News on Friday. The president is expected to make the announcement during a White House event on Saturday. Barrett currently serves as a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump, who has a campaign rally scheduled later Friday night in Virginia, declined to say who he will announce when pressed by reporters at Joint Base Andrews. \"You\u2019ll find out tomorrow,\u201d he said. The announcement is certain to ignite a bruising election-year confirmation battle, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to put up Trump's nominee for a vote. JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT: 5 THINGS TO KNOW Ginsburg died a week ago. Barrett has long been considered a front-runner for the seat after she was closely examined to potentially replace former Justice Anthony Kennedy on the high court. Though Trump eventually selected Justice Brett Kavanaugh for the slot, news outlets reported at the time that Trump said he was \"saving her for Ginsburg.\" The appeals court judge is a former Notre Dame professor and a devout Catholic, a fact that was controversial at her 2017 confirmation hearing to her current seat on the 7th Circuit.\u00a0\"The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told Barrett.\u00a0She was eventually confirmed 55-43. FAITH AND FAMILY: A LOOK AT JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT Barrett, a former clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia,\u00a0is 48 years old. She is a favorite of religious conservatives, an important well of support for Trump. Other top reported contenders have been believed to have been 11th Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa; 4th Circuit Judge Allison Jones Rushing and 6th Circuit Judge Joan Larsen. Trump has repeatedly said that he was considering five\u00a0potential nominees. A Trump justice, if confirmed, would mark his third successful Supreme Court confirmation. That would be more than two-term Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who each successfully nominated two Supreme Court justices. But Democrats say they will do everything possible to ensure that does not happen. The votes at the moment appear to be on the Republicans' side. Only two GOP senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, indicated that they oppose moving forward with a confirmation before the election. And Murkowski recently softened her stance on the matter, indicating that even if she has objections to the process she may vote on the eventual nominee based on her qualifications. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans have 53 Senate seats, meaning they can afford three total defections and Vice President Mike Pence could break a tie to confirm the nominee. It appears unlikely that two senators beyond Collins and Murkowski would oppose a Republican nominee -- but that picture will become clearer after Trump makes his pick on Saturday.

            "article_content": "John Sununu says the only success on Joe Biden's record after 40 years in public office is the crime bill A prominent Delaware law firm founded by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan for between $150,000 and $350,000, according to records released Monday by the Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration. The Trump campaign told Fox News that the records conflict with recent messaging from the Biden campaign that the PPP\u00a0is both ineffective and a vehicle to reward Trump \"cronies.\" \u201cInstead of attacking President Trump as an involuntary reflex, maybe Joe Biden should just say \u2018thank you\u2019 once in a while,\" Trump campaign director of communications Tim Murtaugh told Fox News.\u00a0\"The PPP saved 51 million jobs nationally, including at Biden\u2019s old law firm and a number of companies connected to Obama administration alums. A very likely explanation is that Biden simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about and would rather make a political weapon out of a program that helped people make their rent and mortgage payments.\u201d The law firm that received the big payout was originally founded as\u00a0Biden and Walsh\u00a0and is now known as\u00a0Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder; Biden currently has no financial interest in the firm. However, firm co-founder and partner\u00a0Melvyn Monzack, whom Biden\u00a0called\u00a0one of his \"great friends\" in 2017, has maintained close ties to the former vice president. He served as Biden's 2002 Senate reelection treasurer, as well as the treasurer for Biden's 2008 presidential run. READ THE FULL LIST OF COMPANIES THAT RECEIVED PPP FUNDS OVER 150G According to CBS News, Monzack, who has donated thousands to Biden's presidential campaign, attended a state dinner at the White House for Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2011. The law firm is also a registered agent for companies tied to Biden. Records reviewed by Fox News show that on July 6, 1987, Biden gave Monzack his legal power of attorney to \"demand, sue for and receive all debts, moneys, securities for money, goods, chattels, or other personal property.\" Power of attorney signed by Biden. Last week, the Biden campaign released a video that included\u00a0a small business owner saying the Trump administration had done nothing to help her; the advertisement did not disclose that the business owner received thousands in federal relief money.\u00a0Biden and his allies have also\u00a0stepped up their attacks on what they call President Trump's cronyism\u00a0in the distribution of stimulus money. A Biden aide shot back after this story was published -- both at the Trump campaign, and Fox News. \"The only thing this story tells us is how desperate the Trump campaign is to find an attack on Vice President Biden that sticks, and how eager Fox News is to help them in their efforts,\" the aide said. \"Joe Biden isn't \u00a0the president (yet) and has no control over how PPP funds are distributed, so perhaps instead of covering how a law firm Biden worked briefly at decades ago got a loan, Fox News should examine why the single biggest recipient of PPP funds was a massive Trump donor, or why 40 Trump-connected lobbyists were able to steer more than $10 billion in taxpayer money to their wealthy clients.\" EXCLUSIVE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES IMPROPERLY RECEIVED BAILOUT MONEY Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's team is rejecting reports that a business connected to her husband received big money under the government's emergency coronavirus relief program \u2014\u00a0arguing that his connection to the company is minimial. The company, EDI Associates in San Rafael, California, has 52 employees and says it's in the \"full-service restaurant business,\" government documents show. The company received between $350,000 and $1 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)\u00a0money. \u201cHe\u2019s an investor,\" Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill told Fox News. \"He wasn\u2019t involved in the application for the loan nor was he aware of it.\u201d The Washington Post and Bloomberg reported that EDI Associates is identified in Pelosi's disclosure forms\u00a0\"as a limited partnership with an investment in the El Dorado Hotel. ... The value of the asset on the form -- identified as belonging to Pelosi\u2019s spouse -- is listed as between $250,001 and $500,000.\" The paper noted that \"four other House members surfaced in previous reports about businesses\" that took PPP money, including Republican Reps. Roger Williams of Texas and Vicky Hartzler of Missouri and Democrats Susie Lee of Nevada and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida, who \"have ties to companies that are either run by their families or employ their spouses as a senior executives.\" The Daily Beast reported that other well-known individuals and entities received generous PPP funds, including \"a fiscal responsibility advocacy organization run by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, a high-powered consulting firm run by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the nonprofit headed by former Trump campaign official David Bossie, and a political strategy firm linked to two alumni of the Obama White House who\u2019ve turned anti-Trump podcasting into a lucrative enterprise.\" President Trump\u00a0signed a bill on Saturday\u00a0extending the PPP, a lifeline to businesses struggling to keep paying employees, through Aug. 8 UNIV OF DELAWARE BOARD MEMBERS\u00a0KEEPING BIDEN'S RECORDS SECRET -- AND\u00a0DONATED BIG TO HIS CAMPAIGN The measure also separates the authorized limits for commitments under the PPP from other Small Business Administration loan programs. On Monday, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration disclosed businesses that have received $150,000 as part of the PPP -- a list that includes about two-thirds of total dollars lent, but a much smaller percentage of total loans. The loans can be converted into grants in certain conditions. Fox Business Network's James Legatte contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden argues searching the university's Senate records could expose past political positions that can be taken out of context during the campaign; Peter Doocy reports. Women\u2019s groups are beginning to break their silence on sexual assault allegations against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden after the embattled candidate responded to the claims for the first time on Friday and said the alleged incident \"never happened.\" While they largely stayed quiet for weeks, a few groups had started to publicly pressure Biden to speak up in the run-up to Friday's statements. But the focus wasn't entirely on Biden, either. Now that the interview is over, at least one of those groups sought to use Biden's statement to paint a contrast with President Trump's handling of the multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him. \u201cWe have reached a pivotal moment in our nation when candidates for president are accused of sexual assault,\u201d Tina Tchen, president and CEO of TIME\u2019S UP Now,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cToday, Vice President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves, something that the current president has never done.\u201d BIDEN REJECTS TARA READE ACCOUNT ENTIRELY, SAYS 'THE FACTS IN THIS CASE DO NOT EXIST' \u201cNo longer can claims like this go ignored. Vice President Joe Biden needed to address Tara Reade\u2019s allegation today,\" Tchen, a former aide to former President Barack Obama, said.\u00a0\"We call for complete transparency into this claim and the multiple claims against President Donald Trump. As we go forward, American voters are entitled to a full understanding of all allegations of this nature. Women should be heard, treated respectfully, and have their allegations taken seriously.\" She added, \"By no means is the conversation about sexual assault and power in America over.\" Tchen\u2019s statement came after Biden answered allegations by former staffer Tara Reade that he assaulted her in 1993. The response came in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and in a written statement. \u201cNo, it is not true,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally it never, never happened and it didn\u2019t. It never happened.\u201d Biden was pressed on his past comments about women coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and assault, specifically his comments surrounding the confirmation hearing of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Biden said that \u201cbelieving women means taking women\u2019s claims seriously.\" He added that \u201cwomen have a right to be heard,\u201d but that their claims should be investigated by the press. \u201cThey should start off with the presumption that they\u2019re telling the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThen you have to look at the circumstances and the facts. And the facts in this case do not exist.\u201d The case puts women\u2019s groups, who are typically sympathetic to Biden\u2019s candidacy but who demanded that similar decades-old accusations against\u00a0Kavanaugh be believed, in a difficult position. TARA READE'S TIMELINE: FROM 1990S BIDEN STAFFER TO CENTER OF POLITICAL FIRESTORM Alexis McGill Johnson, Acting President of Planned Parenthood Action Fund,\u00a0said in a statement Friday that the group is \"glad to see Vice President Biden take a needed first step in addressing this issue head on. We now look to Biden to continue to push this conversation, and our country, forward.\" \u201cWe cannot let this conversation devolve into the kind of shame and ridicule that too many survivors face,\" she said. \"That ridicule is what keeps millions silent after they experience sexual violence or assault. That shame is what allows violence to continue.\" Tchen, in an interview with MSNBC, tried to highlight the\u00a0contrast with Trump, who has also denied the allegations against him. \u201cIt\u2019s the voters in this election that are going to make a decision, and are entitled to\u00a0full transparency,\u201d Tchen said. \"Vice President Biden has called for that transparency, President Trump has not ... he has tried to silence survivors who have come forward.\u201d Groups that have been vocal in the #MeToo movement\u00a0have been largely quiet about the allegations against Biden.\u00a0But on Thursday, some of those groups started to increase pressure on Biden to answer allegations. \u201cSaying we believe survivors doesn\u2019t mean only when it\u2019s politically convenient. This isn\u2019t a fringe issue, it\u2019s one that affects all of us. This crosses political party, race, gender, income level, and sexual orientation,\u201d Planned Parenthood Action Fund's\u00a0Johnson said in a statement. \u201cVice President Biden must address this allegation directly. Our country is hungry for leadership on this issue. Now is the time to give it to them.\u201d The Women\u2019s March tweeted that Biden should \"speak to his past, and he needs to do so immediately.\" \"No women should carry the burden for his silence,\u201d the group said. But it will remain to be seen if those groups, as well as groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America and the National Organization for Women, will be satisfied with Biden\u2019s response. Those organizations did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News. While Biden\u00a0gave a firm denial of Reade\u2019s accusations, and also called on the National Archive to search for relevant records, he declined\u00a0to approve a search for Senate records at the University of Delaware, saying that those files would not pertain to personnel issues. TIMELINE SHOWS MEDIA, DEMS' DIFFERENT APPROACH TO TARA READE ACCUSATION AFTER KAVANAUGH FREE-FOR-ALL Heather Drevna, vice president of communications for anti-sexual violence group\u00a0RAINN, also issued a statement Friday pushing for the release of any relevant records:\u00a0\"We appreciate Vice President Biden finally addressing Tara Reade's allegations. These allegations deserve a rigorous investigation, and we urge Vice President Biden to release any and all records that may be relevant, including those housed at the University of Delaware, in addition to any Senate records housed at the National Archives. We urge him, his campaign, and former staff to cooperate fully and provide complete transparency.\" Former Biden Senate staffer Reade\u00a0and seven other women had come forward last year to accuse Biden of inappropriate contact. However, the story she told in March was far more graphic, raising the allegation to the level of sexual assault. Reade told Fox News about numerous instances, particularly in major meetings, where Biden would \"put his hands on my shoulders usually from behind, and put his fingers underneath my hair, on my neck.\u201d During a March interview with podcast host Katie Halper, Reade described the alleged assault in 1993. \"He greeted me, he remembered my name, and then we were alone. It was the strangest thing,\" Reade told Halper. \"There was no like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She continued: \u201cHis hands were on me and underneath my clothes, and he went down my skirt and then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers and he was kissing me at the same time and he was saying some things to me.\u201d Her allegations have received some support in the form of a resurfaced \u201cLarry King Live\u201d interview that appears to show Reade\u2019s mother referring to the accusation, albeit in vague terms. Additionally,\u00a0two more people\u00a0who knew Reade have come forward to say she told them about the allegation at the time. Reade has not yet reacted to Biden's denial.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com. The Democrat running against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in the South Carolina Senate race this year reported raising almost $14 million in the second quarter of 2020, nearly double his record first quarter of the year. Jaime Harrison raised more than $13.9 million from April through June, after raising $7.4 million in the first quarter of the year in his bid to unseat Graham, who has\u00a0been in office since 2003. Still, it will be an uphill battle for Harrison, the state\u2019s former Democratic Party chairman and a DNC associate vice chairman, in the reliably Republican South Carolina. Graham won his reelection bid in 2014 by nearly 15 points, and Trump won the state by a similar margin in 2016. \u201cAfter 25 years in Washington, Lindsey Graham has lost all idea of the most basic challenges facing South Carolina families, and voters know it,\u201d\u00a0Guy King, a spokesman for the Harrison campaign, said in a statement, according to The State. GRAHAM FENDS OFF PRIMARY CHALLENGERS, SECURES GOP SENATE NOMINATION \u201cAs this state breaks new coronavirus records almost every day, Lindsey Graham is spending his time playing partisan games in Washington and fighting to cut unemployment relief,\u201d King added. \u201cVoters here have had enough of these political games, and are turning toward\u00a0Jaime\u2019s bold vision of principled leadership that once again puts South Carolina families first.\u201d South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jamie Harrison gesturing to the crowd during the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention at the Wells Fargo Center, July 28, 2016, in Philadelphia. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images, File) The Graham campaign said Harrison's lofty fundraising wasn't indicative of his popularity in South Carolina. \u201cJaime Harrison\u2019s campaign coffers are packed with contributions from Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Planned Parenthood, Barbara Streisand\u00a0and many other liberals who couldn\u2019t find South Carolina on a map,\u201d\u00a0Graham campaign Communications Director T.W. Arrighi\u00a0told Fox News. \u201cHarrison is being rewarded by Hollywood celebrities and Democratic party bosses for his support of late term abortion, the Green New Deal, free health care for illegals, and more.\u00a0Pandering to radical liberals boosts\u00a0Jaime\u2019s fundraising numbers, but\u00a0those positions cost\u00a0him votes in\u00a0conservative\u00a0South Carolina,\u201d Arrighi added. Though Harrison raised more than Graham in the first quarter, the incumbent has raised more in total this election cycle so far. Graham has raised $26.1 million as of June 20 and had $13.9 million cash on hand, according to the FEC. The three-term senator\u2019s campaign has not yet filed its second-quarter numbers\u00a0and has until July 15 to do so. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump has supported Graham in his reelection bid, campaigning with him in February. Vice President Pence also helped launch Graham\u2019s campaign last year. Harrison has been able to spark national attention for his grassroots campaign from national Democrats desperate to unseat one of the White House\u2019s fiercest allies on Capitol Hill. He\u2019s garnered the endorsement of high-profile Democrats, including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Rep. Jim Clyburn, second-ranking Democrat in the House from South Carolina.",

            "article_content": "Roger Stone was set to report to prison on Tuesday, July 14 to serve his sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into allegations of Russian collusion. The White House issued a response Sunday after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller published an op-ed in the Washington Post in which he defended the prosecution and conviction of political operative Roger Stone. President Trump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence on Friday, just days before it was set to begin. Stone was convicted of seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering\u00a0and making false statements to Congress in relation to Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. ROBERT MUELLER DEFENDS STONE CONVICTION, RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AFGER SHARP CRITICISM FROM WHITE HOUSE \u201cRobert Mueller and his corrupt investigation failed to hold anyone in the Obama-Biden Administration accountable for their negligence toward Russian interference or for spying on the Trump Campaign based on a Democrat-funded dossier full of lies, and instead wasted taxpayer dollars trying to undo an election,\u201d Deputy White House Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement. \u201cMr. Mueller should keep his promise to the American people and let the report, which fully exonerated the President, stand instead of pontificating in the editorial pages with more spin.\u201d In his op-ed, Mueller pointed to Stone\u2019s crimes, which were connected to communications he had about WikiLeaks and the release of hacked emails in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election. \"Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,\" Mueller said in an op-ed published by\u00a0The Washington Post. Stone was not charged with any underlying crime of coordinating with Russia, and he continues to deny wrongdoing. HOUSE DEMOCRATS PROMISE INVESTIGATIONS, LEGISLATION AFTER TRUMP COMMUTES ROGER STONE \u201cI engaged in legitimate, perfectly legal political activity which Mueller\u2019s corrupt investigation chose to criminalize,\u201d Stone told Fox News. \u201cI thought the results of the 2016 election were crucial.\u201d Democrats were aghast when the White House announced that Trump was commuting Stone\u2019s sentence, which was supposed to last 40 months. \"It\u2019s staggering corruption, but I think it\u2019s important for people also to know that it\u2019s a threat to our national security,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, claiming that national security was the motivation behind Trump's impeachment earlier this year, which had nothing to do with Stone or the Russia probe. Pelosi has also called for a bill that would prevent a president from taking similar action in future cases in which the offender is convicted of acts connected to the president. \u201cWe will have legislation that says a president cannot commute or pardon or offer clemency to anybody who commits a crime, is convicted of a crime that affects the president\u2019s behavior and his culpability,\" Pelosi said. In a statement, both House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,\u00a0and House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said they intend to seek \u201can immediate briefing from the White House Counsel on the circumstances surrounding Roger Stone\u2019s commutation.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cIn addition, the Department of Justice should release grand jury materials related to Roger Stone and his communications with the President,\u201d the statement said.

Rapper Kanye West is focusing on another state where he hopes to get on the ballot ahead of this November\u2019s presidential election. West has reportedly hired the petitioning firm Let The Voters Decide to help the rapper/producer get the necessary 2,000 signatures needed to get on the ballot in the swing state of Wisconsin. West has until Tuesday at 5 p.m. to turn in the signatures. The rapper has also set his sights on getting on the ballot in Arkansas, Ohio and West Virginia as the deadlines in those states loom. West has already submitted documents to appear on the ballot in November in Oklahoma, Illinois and Missouri. He missed the deadline in South Carolina last month. KIM KARDASHIAN SPOTTED IN EMOTIONAL VISIT WITH KANYE WEST IN WYOMING FOLLOWING HIS PUBLIC APOLOGY The musician\u2019s on-again, off-again presidential campaign has been roiled with controversy since the start as many people question his mental state following a number of inflammatory and embarrassing tweets and appearances in recent weeks. Most recently, West called out abortion in the Black community and blasted his critics for getting so \"concerned\" about him crying over potentially aborting his first-born child. \"I cried at the thought of aborting my first born and everyone was so concerned about me... I\u2019m concerned for the world that feels you shouldn\u2019t cry about this subject,\" he tweeted on Friday. His comments came after a viral campaign stop in which he cried while discussing how he and his wife apparently considered abortion. The emotional display prompted speculation about his psychological health while his wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian West, posted a video discussing his struggle with bipolar disorder.

            "article_content": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos weighs in on battle over reopening schools. This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" August 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MIKE HUCKABEE, GUEST HOST: I'm Mike Huckabee in for Laura Ingraham tonight. And this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Now, we've got a packed lineup tonight. You're not going to want to miss a moment. Why? It's what your friends are going to be talking about tomorrow. So, buckle up and sit tight. Rudy Giuliani is going to join us on how Kamala Harris could use the DOJ as a tool for revenge and retribution. And President Trump today asked an important question that a lot of parents and taxpayers are asking, if a school is closed, how come they're getting the money. Why not give it to the students who are scrambling to get their education. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is here exclusively. She'll tell us more. And it's Wednesday. You know what that means, Raymond Arroyo joins us for a Biden and Kamala file, Unseen and Seen. He's going to bring us all the moments that no one else has been able or maybe willing to show you. But first, last night, Laura laid out much of what you need to know in order to honestly and objectively assess Kamala Harris as a career politician. But the media is flagrantly lying about who she really is. Remember yesterday, The New York Times called her a pragmatic moderate. George Stephanopoulos obediently echoed that line earlier today. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Kamala Harris comes from the middle of the road moderate wing of the Democratic Party, not the first-choice progressives. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: That's an interesting way to describe the woman who ranked as the most liberal member of the Senate in 2019. How moderate is it to support socialized medicine or mass gun confiscation? She wants open borders and then wants to give free health care for those who came here illegally. That's something most taxpaying American workers don't get. Today, Politico wind up the ante claiming Senator Harris deftly hops between the Democratic Party's shifting tectonic plates. Now that swamp speak far, she's an unprincipled career who will do or say whatever she needs to in order to gain power. That's why she can pay homage to radical Leftist marching through our city streets and then share a toast with Wall Street executives later that night. She has brought together the Amazons of the world with the anarchist. She works the levers of power whenever she can. Case and point, Kamala is the only candidate ever openly endorsed by CNN President Jeff Zucker. Back in 2009, he said, Kamala is not just important for the city of San Francisco, the state of California, but for the entire country. How do you figure see it, coverage is going to be slanted probably just as objective as always, which means one big biased bag of balloon juice? Bottom-line, this is a vice-presidential nominee who has confirmed the worst kept secret of the New Democrats. They've left most of America behind and it's time for folks to wake up and realize it. Joining me now Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor, and host of The Sara Carter Show Podcast. Also, with me former California Congressman Darrell Issa who spent a lot of years in the California delegation with Kamala Harris. Now Sara, this is the woman who would really be running things most likely if Joe Biden were to win in November. So, what would that mean for most Americans. SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Well absolutely. Governor Huckabee, this would be the woman that would be running things because even Vice President Joe Biden has said that himself. He understands that he's aging that this is somebody that he wants to put in place, what it would mean is a radical agenda and somebody who's a chameleon. I mean she transforms herself whenever she wants into whatever she wants. You talked about CNN. Think about she said on CNN, I believe it was April 2019 when she was on with Don Lemon and she said, America should have a discussion about whether or not people in prison, prisoners should be able to vote. And she talks about the Green New Deal. She's for open borders. She doesn't believe that people who cross into the country illegally should ever be jailed or prosecuted. Yet the strange thing is, and the irony is, is that she was willing to prosecute so many people for minor crimes in California. In fact, she prosecuted more people than Joe Biden's insulted in his life. So, I mean, this is a person that is so wishy-washy, I think the American people will see right through it and they'll definitely see right through it before November. There's no way to kind of hide that record. \u00a0HUCKABEE: Speaking of the record, congressman, I say you've worked with Kamala Harris for a long time, you knew her from California, you knew her as the attorney general before she became the senator. What would keep you up at night more than anything else about her being vice president? DARRELL ISSA, FORMER CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: The fact that the president might need to be replaced would keep me up more than anything else. Yes, I knew her as the attorney general. I saw her make great speeches and then be completely hopeless in that role so much so that when she ran as a progressive for Senate, I endorsed and campaigned for Loretta Sanchez, her Democratic opponent. Not an easy thing to do for a seated Republican congressman, but the fact was we had a moderate Democrat and Loretta Sanchez by comparison, and the Left won out and she went on to the Senate. That's who she is. But I think Sara said it very well. It's Chameleon Harris. That's what it's all about. She will change what she says she stands for at the drop of a coin. But at the end of the day, this is somebody owned by the progressive Left time and time again. And right now, she's backing away from the few things she ever did that might be considered to be pro law and order. And if that's gone, she has nothing. \u00a0HUCKABEE: Sara, I want you to react to James Clyburn's comment about the country and where it's headed, keeping in mind that if it weren't for Clyburn, Joe Biden wouldn't be the Democratic nominee. Let's watch this and then your reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM CLYBURN, D-S.C.: You saw this jacket go left and Barack Obama, it went back right. And elected Donald Trump. This country is going back to the Left. I think this ticket is right where the country is. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: OK, there you have it. Sara, go ahead. CARTER: Look, I don't agree with Clyburn at all. HUCKABEE: I'm glad he-- ISSA: Obviously from where he sees it in his district and Nancy Pelosi and his agenda, this is what they would achieve if they get that ticket elected. So, yes, the fact is, he's right in one sense, if they elect that ticket, we're going to the Left. But that's not where America wants to be. When you look at 80 percent of Americans or more in every survey saying they don't want to defund law and order, they want to, in fact, restore law and order, you see very quickly, America is not where they are. HUCKABEE: And Sara, I want you to react to that because. Go ahead. I want you to react to that. CARTER: Yes, absolutely. I agree 100 percent. The American people understand what's happened. I mean, we've suffered a lot through COVID over the last six months. We've seen the escalation of rioting and violence that buttressed off of the tragic death of George Floyd. And now the American people are going to face another extraordinary challenge. I believe this is going to be one of the most important elections in modern political history because it's going to determine the future of the United States. Do we want a United States that is based and I've said this before on American values and principles and freedom and capitalism and choice, or do we want a United States that is going to go to the radical Left, that we are going to lose all those freedoms? And the American people do not - it's not going to be surprising to watch what happened in 2016 happened again in 2020. And we'll see President Trump win by a landslide. HUCKABEE: Well, I see - let me interrupt here because I want to play this clip with Jeff Zeleny from CNN and get your reaction to it, congressman. Here we go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: As the campaign moves along, I am told that Senator Harris, the anticipation is for her to visit swing states, it is for her to be out campaigning as much as she can, probably more so than Joe Biden. We've seen a similar thing on the Republican side. The Vice President Mike Pence travels extensively. and President Trump has not traveled nearly as much. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: OK, so congressman, it seems like there is such a-- ISSA: Governor, that's just not true. HUCKABEE: Yes, go ahead. \u00a0ISSA: That's just not true. The fact is, although Vice President Pence has kept a full schedule, no president has traveled more than President Trump or did it with more energy right up until the last hours in 2016. He proved that he could outwork, as you know, Senator Clinton, and that's how he became the president. But I think the more important subliminal message there is apparently the difference between California and Delaware is, we don't have - we don't have basements in California to hide in the way Vice President Biden is. And so, yes, she'll probably not be hiding in a basement. But the fact is, what they're really doing is sending you code that Vice President Biden is not going to campaign. They're going to sequester him away because he's senility is a problem. \u00a0HUCKABEE: Sara Carter, Congressman Issa, thank you both for being with us. My next guest says Kamala actually opens the Democrats and Joe Biden to a bit of danger. Here to tell us how, Doug Schoen, Democrat pollster and former adviser to President Clinton and Mike Bloomberg. Doug, she's called Joe Biden a segregationist. She said that she agrees with his sexual harassment accusers, but it's a primary win last night that you say offers another warning sign. I want you to explain that. DOUG SCHOEN, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER: Sure. The Squad has been uniformly successful, governor, in their primaries. Representative Omar was facing a very well-funded candidate, also a self-described progressive, who outraised her in the fourth quarter. And she - I'm sorry the second quarter and she won by, I think, over 15 points. Representative Tlaib lead won handily. And AOC was renominated with about three quarters of the vote. So, it's not just what your guests are saying are the positions of the Democratic Party. That will be debated, governor. But it is incontrovertible that the Far Left has had great success getting reelected in-House races and also electing a number of additional members to the Democratic delegation. HUCKABEE: Doug, to the Democrats who are voting for these people, do they truly understand what they represent or are they just kind of following the celebrity status of these folks? That's a real question. I think that the American people need to know. How much are these folks representing the heart and soul of today's Democratic Party. SCHOEN: The people that are voting in Democratic primaries now, governor, are not the same people, you and I remember voting in Democratic primaries, the moderates. You're getting the activist progressive wing, who if they don't understand the precise ideas, get the basic ideology. And they do support to a much greater degree than the rest of the electorate defunding the police Green New Deal, Medicare for All, policies that are out of step with the broader American electorate. HUCKABEE: I want to also ask 80 million-gun owners in America, the Democrats have made it pretty clear they're going to go after people's guns. And 34 percent of the NRA members themselves are Democrats. How big a vulnerability does this create for Democrats who use that message and think it's a winner? SCHOEN: Well, the winning message is to be for background checks, for eliminating any possibility that anyone who has any sexual abuse in their background can get a gun, getting rid of the gun show loophole. I would strongly urge the Democrats to support those kinds of policies and not support gun confiscation, which will not be a winner. Getting rid of assault weapons is one thing, but anything else is not going to be helpful politically. HUCKABEE: Doug Schoen, thank you very much. Good to see you. But we don't need to think too hard about how a Vice President Kamala Harris, would abuse her office. That's because MSNBC gave us a little preview of that early today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON JOHNSON, MSNBC POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Someone, once Biden takes office, is going to be tasked with going through this entire administration with a fine-tooth comb and basically expunging all the Trumpist, like getting rid of the Baath Party in Iraq. Senator Harris will be fantastic at finding those people and removing them. She can help us impeach some of these judges, these underqualified judges that Donald Trump has managed to push in. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: We don't have to take his word for it. Back in January 2019, Senator Harris said if she were in the White House, she would use the DOJ to pursue criminal charges against President Trump. She even told NPR, I believe that they would have no choice and that they should. Yes. Well, joining me now, Rudy Giuliani, former New York City Mayor, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Mayor, how unprecedented and how damaging would it be for a Biden administration to criminally prosecute a former president? RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Well, we've become a banana republic governor and that's where we're headed now. I mean Biden has nothing left. She's a very mean woman and she was a terrible prosecutor. I mean, she was a phony prosecutor. She prosecuted thousands and thousands of little people. 1500 marijuana smokers, but very few big drug dealers. She let every politically connected person go. She even let a guy go who murdered two people, including a journalist. She gave him probation. She was a horrible prosecutor. Her conviction rate was so low that she would plead cases out and people would just walk out. The murder rate went up substantially. And so, all you need to know about it, the murder rate went up substantially when she was district attorney and San Francisco, became very dangerous. So, she's a phony district attorney. She was a phony AG and she would do exactly what that man said. She's a very mean person. Nobody likes it. HUCKABEE: It's interesting to me, Rudy, that so many people prior to Joe Biden selecting her, we're saying, oh, no, she would be terrible. Of course, as soon as they announced, she would be wonderful. We all know how that goes. I always said the vice presidency is a job nobody wants, and nobody ever turns it down. So, now we have Kamala Harris. But there are some issues with things that people have brought up. What you just talked about is one of the ways in which Tulsi Gabbard during the Democrat debates just basically took her down in the second debate. I know we're going to see this stuff again, because if the Democrats don't bring it up. I kind of got a feeling to the president's party. GIULIANI: Well when you're darn right. I mean, she's the worst kind of prosecutor. She's a bully. She prosecutes the little people, the marijuana smoker. I mean, I was a prosecutor for 17 years. I never prosecuted a single marijuana smoker. Instead, I prosecuted the heads of the Mafia, the heads of the Colombian cartels. She'd run away from a case like that. She ran away from investigating the Catholic Church, large numbers of files of pedophiles, she refused to release. She - look, there were hundreds of police shootings when she was D.A. She wouldn't touch them. She won't even investigate them. She's afraid to go after the police. She was afraid to go after the Catholic Church. Anybody connected to Willie Brown of politics? Oh, my God. They got the courthouse and she go after little people. She went after parents. She went after parents and put them in jail because their children were truant, including a woman whose child was very, very ill and she didn't bother to check. I mean, she's a horrible person. She is mean and she is an incompetent lawyer. And she was an incompetent D.A. and that's why she plead cases down, because otherwise she would've had no conviction rate. She couldn't convict anybody at trial. The guy who committed murder, who she let out, was finally convicted by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, which is a real district attorney's office. HUCKABEE: Rudy, the problem with you is we just never know where you're coming from. We just don't know what you really think. I want you to react. We've only got about 30 seconds. But I want you to react to this tweet from the leading Never Trumper Bill Kristol. He said, just an innocent thought. We've seen Biden in office for over four decades and we've seen Trump nonstop for the last four years. We've seen enough to make up our minds about them. So, let's skip the presidential debates, but have three vice-presidential debates. They clearly know Joe Biden is not ready for debating Donald Trump. Is that why you're calling for four, not just three debates? GIULIANI: Kristol is a bitter little man, and it's a shame to see it. He is a very smart guy. And he's just a bitter little person. I mean, of course, they should have five debates. Look, unless the entire country has gone crazy, Joe Biden is senile. There's no question about it. The question is how bad, it only gets worse. You know that governor, that illness is progressive. It's vicious, it's awful. I feel sorry for him. But he shouldn't be president when he doesn't know what he's doing, when he can't finish a sentence, when he can't get through a thought without. And then he read I mean, MSNBC covered it up, he read his talk with her yesterday on Zoom. He read it there. HUCKABEE: Mayor, we've got to go. I appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. Well, is the White House-- GIULIANI: Thank you, governor. You're doing a great job. HUCKABEE: I appreciate it. We're going to find out if the White House is winning the messaging on school openings and could they really divert tax money from schools who refused to open and give it back to the parents? Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is here exclusively in just a few moments to tell us. We'll be back. And still ahead, Raymond Arroyo, he's going to be here to tell us all the unseen moments from the last 24 hours of Biden and Kamala. So, stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HUCKABEE: Well, less than a week after New York allowed schools to reopen, New Jersey is now ordering their own districts to follow suit. Governor Phil Murphy requiring schools to offer at least some in-person learning this fall. Schools can offer only online classes if they can prove that they can't safely reopen. Now, this all comes after immense public pressure from parents, from shows like this one and from the Trump administration. Few have been more vocal in pointing out just how imperative it is that we get kids back in school. And Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who just happens to be my next guest. Madam Secretary, I appreciate you joining us tonight. Let's talk about what more can the administration do to make sure that if kids are back in school, they're back in school safely? BETSY DEVOS, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: Well, we had a very important conversation with parents and educators at the White House with the president today. And President Trump has been really leaning into and boldly leading on ensuring that kids, kids' interests are being met and that parents and families and kids are not being held captive to other people's fears or agendas. And we have seen in all too many districts and all too many schools across the country, not actually addressing the needs of students, anticipating school in the fall, talking about keeping - we all want to ensure students and teachers are safe when they're in school again, but those things can be done and can be clearly accomplished. The science is very clear on this. What's been very clear is that there is an alternative agenda that includes defunding the police, universal health care, destroying charter schools, eliminating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. This is all what teachers' unions are demanding in order for kids for them to go back to school. I was really pleased to see that Governor Murphy in New Jersey has now joined Governor Cuomo and insisting that the option of in-person school has to be an option given to kids. Kids have got to be together. They have got to be with their peers and in classrooms with their teachers. And we need to ensure that this happens. HUCKABEE: I worked with a director of education in our state who used to say there are school people and there are kid people. Some people are all about making sure that the schools are the focus, but we really ought to be focused on making the kids the focus. The president suggested that by saying that if schools aren't going to open, send the money to the kids. Let's watch this. And then I want your reaction to what the president suggested. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'd like to see the money follow the student if a school is going to be closed and we're giving all of this money on the federal basis to a school. The money should follow the student. And this way you can make your own choice if a school is closed. Why are we paying the school? I'd rather give it to the student, the parents, and you do your own thing. That's something that we want to do. Having a hard time with the Democrats. They want the money to follow the union. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: You know, I think I heard a loud amen from across America with parents saying, hey, if you're not going to open the school to my children, give me the money. Because if I'm going to have to pay to get their education, I'd like to be able to have some money to do it. It sounds like you're on board with that as well, Madam Secretary. \u00a0DEVOS: Well, that's absolutely right. Families need to have options. They need to have choices. They need to be able to find the right fit for their child or their children. And it's becoming ever more clear in the last few months that this is more and more necessary for families across the country. We've had an education system that's been static for decades, a one size fits all approach. And if we've learned anything in the last several months, it's that children are not one size fits all and their education needs are not one size fits all. And the response to this is has not been a one size fits all. We heard from a mom today who's starting with another group of families. One of these things, they're calling pods a small micro school in someone's home or a small building somewhere. There's many other families that are considering home schooling and there are other families that would like to send their child to a school, a private, maybe faith based school, many of which have demonstrated the ability to reopen again and are right on track with doing so. We need to ensure that all families have those opportunities. And the president is absolutely right and strong in his support for advancing this notion of money following the student otherwise known as school choice. And Senator Tim Scott has introduced a bill that could do just that and Congress could take action to make sure that happens. HUCKABEE: Well, let's hope it does, because it makes a whole lot of sense. And it's kind of what worries me as to why Washington will never do it, because it makes a lot of sense. Secretary DeVos, thank you for joining us, delighted to have you here. DEVOS: Thanks so much. HUCKABEE: And it's not just K through 12 education that demands the Trump administration's attention. Higher education has become a bastion of speech codes, conservative intimidation, and much worse. Take the University of Southern Maine. Please, take them. They are now asking community members to sign a Black Lives Matter statement and antiracism pledge. What's worse, the school also published the names of people who signed it, which in this political climate means that those who don't sign it will almost certainly face retaliation and maybe even have mobs showing up at their homes. Joining me now, John Eastman, Claremont Institute senior fellow and constitutional scholar. John, this is a public university. People pay taxes and that's what funds this place. They are basically threatening the staff into signing a political document. I wonder, is that even legal? JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: It's not legal, it's not constitutional, and it's been that way for decades and decades. The Supreme Court a long time ago in a case dealing with Jehovah's Witnesses saying the Pledge of Allegiance. It's a very famous line in Supreme Court jurisprudence. If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official high or petty can proscribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. This is a standard of First Amendment law. You can't compel people to take a particular position when you're a public university or the government more broadly. HUCKABEE: So John, somebody doesn't sign this, do they sue the university? And how long does that take to wrap through the courts? EASTMAN: Well, that's going to take a long time, but I'd be concerned if they're fired, if their terms of employment are affected thereby. And look, we have to understand the propaganda nature of this. The same thing happened some years ago with the safe space movement, where faculty that were fully supportive of the homosexual rights agenda would put safe space stickers on their doors. The implication, of course, is if you didn't go along with that agenda and put that sticker up, you were an unsafe space. The same thing is being sought here. If you don't sign this antiracist pledge -- which is itself racist. The author of the language of this thing has admitted he wants reverse racism. If you don't sign it, then by definition you are the opposite of antiracist, which must be racist. It's pure propaganda. It has no place in an institution, a governmental institution, a public university. But at some point, we have got to quit calling them higher education. That's becoming a contradiction in terms. HUCKABEE: The president appoints judges, and regardless of who the president is, do you think Americans are finally begin to understand just how critical it is that we have a president that appoints judges who actually have read and believes in the Constitution? EASTMAN: Well, I think that's right. and we should be really clear here. People are not cheering because this president appointed conservatives or liberals to advance an unconstitutional conservative agenda instead of an unconstitutional liberal agenda. What their cheering is that this president has appointed people who are faithful to the language of the Constitution as originally understood and know the limits of their authority from the bench. HUCKABEE: John, thank you very much for joining us. John Eastman, great to have you here. EASTMAN: Thank you. HUCKABEE: Coming up, it's \"Seen and Unseen,\" the \"Momala\" edition. Raymond Arroyo is going to break down the hype and phony rhetoric surrounding Biden's big announcement today. Stay right there. We'll be back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HUCKABEE: I know you've been waiting for it. Well, it's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment, where we reveal the story behind the Biden-Harris rollout. And for that, of course, we go to Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor. Raymond, you picked up some signs during this Biden rollout that others might have missed. So why don't you tell us what we all ought to know? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Governor, great to be with you. Look, from the very start there were stumbles today. The campaign rolled out this video of Biden purportedly asking Senator Harris to join the ticket. But even at the start, he seemed utterly lost. Look at the face. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: Hi, hi, hi, hi. Sorry to keep you. BIDEN: That's all right. Are you ready to go to work? HARRIS: Oh, my God, I'm so ready to go to work. BIDEN: First of all, is the answer yes? HARRIS: The answer is absolutely yes, Joe, and I'm ready to work. I am ready to do this with you, for you. I'm just, I'm just deeply honored, and I'm very excited. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Now, Governor, the poor man was holding the iPhone backwards as he spoke. And Biden and had a script on his desk, which he read, trying to explain to Harris of the reasons for choosing her. Nothing says \"I love you\" like reading a script. And oddly, MSNBC cropped that cue card out of their on-air shot, as did the folks over at CNN. Now, due to Biden's condition, Governor, this campaign is scripted and totally controlled, really to the nth degree. Even today's big unveiling, it felt choreographed. They marched in in masks. There were no questions or conversations with any outsiders, which Biden explained away this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I wish we were able to talk to the folks outside, but we're keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Now governor, I've been saying from the start, Biden's real running mate is COVID-19. (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: But as the cases and deaths decrease, OK, how smart a strategy is this where he and Harris embrace COVID-19 so tightly? That was part of their governing message today. HUCKABEE: I find it funny, Raymond, that he is saying because of COVID they can't go out. Has he ever heard of things like Skype or Zoom or a telephone? He can still talk to people, but he doesn't want to because he's afraid of what he'll say. And the only people more afraid of him saying it are all those people around him. ARROYO: The campaign at home biting their nails. After a decent reading, OK, and he started well, he was reading a teleprompter, Biden's intro of Kamala Harris seemed to run out of steam. He made a few bizarre points and then started repeating himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: You've all watched her in the United States Senate asking the tough questions needing to be asked, and not stopping until she got an answer. And when none was forthcoming, it was obvious what the answer was. We're in a battle for the soul of the nation. That's when I decided to run. And I'm proud now to have Senator Harris at my side. Possibilities, possibilities. Let me say it again -- possibilities. Everyone, everyone, the ability for everyone -- and we mean everyone. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Everyone, Governor. It's almost like listening to a tape player with bad batteries. (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: The speech slows down, then it glitches, then it gets loud. It's very odd. The question is, is Biden's performance at this point sufficient to be competitive in this race, Governor? HUCKABEE: I think it's going to be really hard for him to take that game onto the debate stage with Donald Trump. I've been on the debate stage with Donald Trump, and you can't carry that up there and expect to come out with your head still on your shoulders. ARROYO: No, he's an improvisatory artist. You've got to watch him. For her part, Kamala Harris painted a doom and gloom portrait of America. She blamed the present for everything from the pandemic to racial divisions. But also did something I've never seen a running mate do before. She echoed her own campaign slogan from the primaries, and something more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: Kamala Harris for the people. Electing Joe Biden is just the start of the work ahead of us. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Electing Biden is just the start of the work ahead of us. It's almost like she is running for the top slot here. In fact, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes that Biden has chosen \"Harris, whose resume suggests she will be ready to step in if and when Biden decides to step aside.\" The guy isn't even the official Democratic nominee, governor, they are already pushing him aside. This is like that show \"Designated Survivor,\" sans the tragedy and the election. Have you ever seen anything like this? HUCKABEE: No, Raymond, I haven't. I'm telling you, I think she comes into this with more baggage than Delta Airlines on Thanksgiving weekend, it's going to be fun to watch. (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: Finally, Gov, I've got to get to this. I want to show you the end of the press conference. A lot of people didn't see this. People often reveal more when they don't speak then when they do. Look here, she finishes speaking, Kamala Harris, and the music comes up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: And a very odd thing happens, they never come into contact. He almost waved her off, OK, when she goes to approach Joe Biden. This looks like the dance at a body odor convention. They never touch. There's no contact, no real connection. So despite all the happy talk, despite all how close Biden and Harris are, except for matching masks, we saw nothing to reinforce their connection. So I guess they are committed to their running mate, COVID-19. (LAUGHTER) HUCKABEE: Raymond, that's why we love watching you. Thank you, Raymond Arroyo. ARROYO: I love being with you. HUCKABEE: We're going to see you tomorrow night, when you will be guest hosting for Laura. That will be great. ARROYO: I will, indeed. Thank you, Governor. HUCKABEE: ANGLE fans, you're going to get more of Raymond tomorrow night, because, as I say, he is filling in for Laura. You better mark that down. Joe Biden likes to paint himself as a man of faith. So if he does, why did he pick a running mate who has repeatedly vilified religion? We are going to find out about that, because coming up, Joe Biden will be kind of analyzed. We'll just figure out what's going to happen. That's coming out right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Mike Huckabee said the other day in part \"I don't know of anybody, people of faith, who think Joe Biden is a great choice.\" JOHN KASICH, FORMER OHIO GOVERNOR: Faith is a matter of your personal relationship. And so I don't know why that's been said about Joe. I think he is a man of faith. I don't think anybody can speak for the entire faith community and try to, try to say that this person is good and that person isn't. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: I've known John Kasich for a number of years. I'm really disappointed that he is letting his personal pain over being bested by Donald Trump four years ago turn him into a bitter and vengeful voice of never Trumpism. Four years ago, when he was the sitting governor of Ohio, he refused to so much as offer a welcome to his state for the Republican National Convention. But this time he's pledged he's going to speak at this year's Democrat Convention. And four years ago, he, like all of us who ran in the Republican primary, publicly pledged, even signed a document, that he would support the GOP nominee. He was dishonest about that, as well. Now, he says he's going to vote for a candidate who is for pro taxpayer- funded abortion, who is for same-sex marriage, and who would force the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Catholic nuns, to provide birth control and abortion pill coverage in their health care package. Biden is such a devout Catholic that he was the denied communion on the campaign trail last year, and his choice of Kamala Harris as vice president, no champion of issues that Christians and people of faith really care about. This is the same woman who last year implied that a federal judicial nominee's membership in the Knights of Columbus disqualified him from even sitting on the bench. Joining me now, Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chair. Matt, how can Joe Biden call himself a man of faith and bring on someone like Kamala Harris? MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIR, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yes, this is a real problem, governor. If you look at the record of Kamala Harris while she's been in the Senate, she had a hostility toward Catholic nominees for the federal bench or other Trump positions like we've really never seen. We're back to the time 100 ago when it was Catholics need not apply. She asked various Catholic nominees if they knew that the Knights of Columbus was a male-only institution that believed in traditional marriage, that believed in the rights of the unborn, or she characterized it, stood up against the reproductive rights of women. What she is basically saying with these questions is that if you are a person of faith, if you're a devout Catholic, and if you take the dogmas of the church seriously, biblically-based, that you're not qualified to sit on the bench. Now, that runs counter to the history of this country and our constitutional order, which says there's no religious test in order to serve in this government. And this is bigotry, these questions were bigoted, and there's no room -- and Joe Biden shouldn't just not just go along with this. He should have called this type of bigotry out. HUCKABEE: I want us to watch this. Kamala Harris also used her position as attorney general of California to punish Planned Parenthood's enemies. Right here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID DALEIDEN, PROJECT LEAD, CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS: While she was running for U.S. Senate, while Planned Parenthood in California was contributing to her political campaign, did she recuse herself from the Planned Parenthood investigation? No, she didn't. She consciously and willfully involved herself directly and personally in the Planned Parenthood case. She had an in-person meeting with six Planned Parenthood executives from California in Los Angeles two weeks before the raid on my apartment. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUCKABEE: Matt, we've only have about 30 seconds, so I've got to really squeeze you on time, but how do you react to what she did today with it? SCHLAPP: Well, it's this hunger to make sure that abortion is always kept legal. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris believe in no restrictions on abortion at any time. Even when the baby is born, it can still be killed. Joe Biden now believes that the parishioners he attends church with at St. Joseph's Church and his pastor should pay for these abortions all across this country. It's really radical stuff. They say my body, my choice. You know what, what I say to them is our soul, my soul, my choice. Allow Catholics, allow Christians to practice their faith fully. It's what makes America a special place. HUCKABEE: Matt, we've got to go. Matt Schlapp, thank you. One of my favorites, Matt Schlapp. We'll be right -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HUCKABEE: My new book, \"Three C's that Made America Great, Christianity, Capitalism, and the Constitution,\" written with coauthor Steve Feazel, hits the shelves September the 1st. But it's available for preorder right now on Amazon. Real insights on direct sources of the real America that some politicians seem to know little about. Well, that's all the time we have tonight. I hope you'll join me this weekend on TBN for my special show. I'm Mike Huckabee. I'm in for Laura Ingram. Right now, Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night,\" they're going to take it from here.

Torben S\u00f8ndergaard, of The Last Reformation, held gatherings at\u00a0Des Plaines' historic Methodist Campground in Cook County until city leaders issued an emergency order this week to stop them, requiring masks and social distancing at any and all events, CBS 2 Chicago reported. 'LET US WORSHIP' FOUNDER CALLS OUT CALIFORNIA LEADERS' CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN HYPOCRISY According to Alderman Andrew\u00a0Goczkowski, the order\u00a0puts \"Des Plaines' face covering and social distancing requirements a step ahead of Governor Pritzker's executive order,\" which limits public gatherings to 50 people and includes exemptions for religious groups, Patch.com reports. \"You can riot as much as you want with no social distancing, with no masks and no one stops you, but worshipping\u00a0God is\u00a0dangerous and suddenly you are spreading the virus,\"\u00a0S\u00f8ndergaard told Fox News. Torben S\u00f8ndergaard of The Last Reformation speaking at a revival meeting in a Chicago suburb after police visited the grounds. (The Last Reformation/YouTube) Police hand-delivered the\u00a0order to S\u00f8ndergaard on Wednesday, mandating that anyone traveling through the city must practice social distancing\u00a0and wear a mask whether on private or public property. Police Chief William Kushner told the Journal & Topics Thursday that\u00a0each person attending the revival could be fined $750 if they are not wearing masks or practicing social distance,\u00a0but\u00a0S\u00f8ndergaard said the order he received did not state a penalty for noncompliance. \"They're really trying to shut us down. I feel like they're using COVID-19 to intimidate us, otherwise, they could've had those guidelines in place weeks ago,\" added the evangelist, who said he fled religious persecution in\u00a0Denmark last year and is seeking political asylum in the United States, according to CBN News. \"We're waiting for police to deliver the 'new' set of rules.\" \"It's very, very difficult to plan anything when guidelines and rules just change,\"\u00a0S\u00f8ndergaard said.\u00a0\"We see this kind of religious persecution because there are some people who don't want us there.\" Organizers of the revival meetings said they got a tent permit and were following state and local orders, but after area residents expressed anger that attendees were not social distancing or wearing masks, the city reversed course. PLANNED PARENTHOOD SUES POP-UP CHURCH OVER NOISE, BUT PASTOR SAYS THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY \u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous because we are in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d\u00a0Des Plaines resident Tria Robinson told WGN-TV. The majority of Illinois' more than 179,000 confirmed\u00a0coronavirus cases and at least 7,677 deaths are in Cook County, which is expected to announce new guidelines Friday, ABC 7 Chicago reports. \"Cook County and the city of Chicago both have a serious problem,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said. \"I mean, look, every region has increasing positivity rates and increasing cases. This is hugely problematic. It's not something we wanted to see happen, but it means we're going to have to take a hard look at what we need to do, what mitigations we need now in order to get us back in line in the direction where we were going, which was reducing those positivity rates.\" Prior to the city council's meeting, Colt Moylan, 2nd Ward Alderman, wrote in a statement that the city\u00a0\"did not approve of this event\" but \"had no choice but to issue a tent permit,\" adding \"the governor exempted religious groups from his order ... the group is peaceful so far ... is largely contained to the campground in tents, campers, and RVs ...We will issue tickets after the fact if warranted.\" S\u00f8ndergaard wrote online that he sent a letter to President Trump to \"ask for his help.\" \"I\u2019m asking all Americans to pray now for a supernatural intervening to stop this socialist agenda before we become like China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela or Iran,\"\u00a0he added.

            "article_content": "King's College senior fellow scholar Mark Smith and University of Memphis law professor Steve Mulroy discuss Ginsburg's career. The 2020 presidential election,\u00a0Senate races and the American political status quo have been turned upside-down\u00a0 with the death of\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as President Trump said Monday he is likely to forge ahead with plans to announce a high court nominee at the end of this week. The fight to replace Ginsburg\u00a0on the highest court in the United States, with a justice who could potentially tip the balance of the tribunal for decades,\u00a0is shaping up to be one of the nastiest\u00a0in recent American political history. And it\u00a0comes as Americans were already dealing with several political crises and a high-stakes presidential election. TRUMP SAYS SUPREME COURT LIST IS DOWN TO 5 PEOPLE, ANNOUNCEMENT COMING FRIDAY OR SATURDAY Within hours of Ginsburg's death, top members of the U.S. Senate and presidential candidates were laying down markers on what should be done with the newly-minted Supreme Court vacancy just weeks ahead of a presidential election. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG DEAD AT 87 \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a Friday tweet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0however, said that \"President Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden added Friday: \"Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.\" TRUMP RALLY CROWD CHANTS 'FILL THAT SEAT!' AS SUPREME COURT CHOICE LOOMS When the news first broke Friday night, President Trump was holding a rally, unaware of Ginsburg's passing. When he was informed by the media, he expressed his sadness. Trump later in the weekend said he intended to nominate a successor to Ginsburg, and the crowd at a subsequent Trump rally Saturday night chanted \"Fill that seat!\" His campaign is already selling t-shirts emblazoned with the new slogan. And Trump Monday said on \"Fox & Friends\" that the Senate should vote on Ginsburg's successor before the presidential election. Trump's past two Supreme Court appointments -- Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch -- filled in for Republican-appointed Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. That means they did not significantly tip the balance of the court. Nevertheless, Democrats indicated that they intended to filibuster Gorsuch, prompting McConnell to nuke the Supreme Court filibuster, and resisted the Kavanaugh confirmation every step of the way in what became one of the ugliest episodes in modern American political history. Now Trump and McConnell are intending to confirm a successor to\u00a0Ginsburg: A\u00a0former ACLU general counsel who was one of the hardest fighters for women's rights in the 20th Century. A\u00a0Clinton-appointed, rock-solid liberal. \"The Notorious R.B.G.,\" an unlikely pop-culture icon revered on the left the same way the right reveres Ronald Reagan. So Democrats are already in open revolt. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, R-N.Y., held a joint press conference with Schumer\u00a0in Brooklyn Sunday night where she sent a stern warning that the Ginsburg vacancy would crystalize Democrats ahead of the presidential election. SCHUMER AND AOC CALL ON VOTERS TO PRESSURE GOP SENATORS INTO DELAYING TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE \"We need to make sure that\u00a0we mobilize on an\u00a0unprecedented scale to ensure that this vacancy is reserved for the\u00a0next president. And we must use\u00a0every tool at our disposal -- from\u00a0everyday people, especially in\u00a0swing states.\u00a0We need everyday people to call\u00a0on senators, to call on folks on the\u00a0bubble... to ensure that we buy\u00a0ourselves the time necessary,\" she said. Ocasio-Cortez added: \"We all need to be more\u00a0courageous and we all must act\u00a0in unprecedented ways to make\u00a0sure that our rights are\u00a0stabilized...\u00a0And to Mitch\u00a0McConnell, we need to tell him\u00a0that he is playing with fire.\u00a0We need to make sure that this\u00a0vacancy is protected, that our\u00a0election continues and that the\u00a0American people have their say.\" Schumer, in the Senate minorty,\u00a0has little he can do besides try to persuade Republican senators to vote against any Trump Supreme Court appointment, which he did Sunday in asking people to respect Ginsburg's reported wish that she be replaced only after the presidential election. \"And we only need two more senators to say that they will abide by RBG's wish, two have already said it,\" Schumer said.\u00a0\"We need two more. So Americans, if you care about all these rights, if you don't want big, powerful, wealthy special interests to turn the clock back 100 years, even, please, our fervent plea, our fervent wish is that you call your senator and say abide by the wishes of this saintly, brilliant, caring woman and let it wait.\" CORY BOOKER SAYS GOP MOVE TO IMMEDIATELY CONFIRM GINSBURG SUCCESSOR UNDERMINES LEGITIMACY OF SUPREME COURT Voters already seem to be responding -- there was a demonstration before dawn Monday morning at the home of Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Schumer has also tried a more intimidating, hardline tact. \"Let me be clear,\" Schumer said on a call with his caucus over the weekend, \"If Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans move forward with this, then nothing is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table.\" Schumer was likely referring to threats Democrats have been making for months to pack the Supreme Court and get rid of the legislative filibuster if they manage to take back the Senate in the November elections. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., was more direct in his threat: \"Mitch McConnell set the precedent. No Supreme Court vacancies filled in an election year. If he violates it, when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.\" MARKEY THREATENS TO PACK SUPREME COURT, ABOLISH FILIBUSTER IF TRUMP FILLS SEAT This week will be key as both sides position for the battle ahead. McConnell is expected to speak on the Senate floor during the 3 p.m. hour on Monday in remarks that could be among the most important the 78-year-old has made in his career -- setting the tone for what is likely to be a knock-down, drag-out, confrontation of raw\u00a0political power and will in the coming months. Both sides are also poised to spend massive amounts of money on this confirmation battle. Schumer will also likely hit the Senate floor Monday during the 3 p.m. hour. All of this will happen as the Trump administration is considering who it wants to nominate to fill the Ginsburg seat, with a nomination potentially coming as early as Friday or Saturday from Trump's pre-vetted list of candidates. The three reported frontrunners over the weekend are 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Judge Barbara Lagoa of the 11th Circuit and Judge Allison Jones Rushing of the 4th Circuit. 'The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern' TOM COTTON SAYS SENATE WILL MOVE FORWARD ON CONFIRMING GINSBURG SUCCESSOR 'WITHOUT DELAY' WHILE TOP SENATE DEM ALLEGES HYPOCRISY Trump previously considered Barrett for the seat he eventually nominated Kavanaugh to, but according to Axios at the time said he was \"saving her for Ginsburg.\" And Barrett, a former Notre Dame Law professor (Ginsburg was a professor herself before becoming a judge), is a favorite among religious conservatives. Further, many on the right see Barrett as someone who could weather what will inevitably be a toxic confirmation process after Democrats seemed to attack her for her Catholic faith during her previous confirmation process. \"The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told Barrett during her circuit court confirmation hearing in 2017. Democrats making similar comments in 2020 would seemingly also be attacking their presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who has featured his Catholic faith on the campaign trail as he seeks to portray himself as a moral alternative to Trump. But the key to the potentially filling the Supreme Court vacancy either before the presidential election or after it while Trump is a lame-duck president will be in whether Republicans can round up enough votes. In 2016 they held open Scalia's seat for several months before the presidential election, saying the American people should have a say in who filled that seat. Trump won, resulting in Justice Neil Gorsuch instead of D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, then-President Obama's nominee, being elevated to the Supreme Court. Now, Democrats are accusing Republicans of rank hypocrisy for moving to fill the Ginsburg seat. 'After Kavanaugh, the rules have changed as far as I'm concerned' \"In light of the vacancy created by Justice Ginsburg\u2019s death, we call upon you to state unequivocally and publicly that you will not consider any nominee to fill Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat until after the next President is inaugurated,\" Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a message to Graham. \"There cannot be one set of rules for a Republican President and one set for a Democratic President, and considering a nominee before the next inauguration would be wholly inappropriate.\" Graham had previously said he would hold open a vacancy happening in the last year of Trump's term, but Graham has more recently reversed himself, noting that the Senate and the presidency are in the same hands after the 2018 election when in 2014 Americans had voted for a divided government. Graham also last month said that \"the rules have changed as far as I'm concerned,\" after the Kavanaugh nomination battle, according to NBC News. Graham added in a tweet Sunday: \"Democrats chose to set in motion rules changes to stack the court at the Circuit level and they chose to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s life to keep the Supreme Court seat open. You reap what you sow.\" McConnell has made the argument that precedent is on the Republicans' side. \"In the last midterm before Justice Scalia's death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president's second term. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president's Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year,\" McConnell said in a statement Friday. SCOTUS BATTLE PROMPTS THREATS, CALLS FOR ARSON: 'BURN CONGRESS DOWN' \"By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary,\" he added. A Trump nominee's fate ahead of the election or while Trump is a lame duck would rest on the persuasiveness of those arguments to a small sect of moderate Republican senators and GOP senators up for reelection. The GOP already appears to have lost two votes, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who have each said they think it would be inappropriate to fill the Ginsburg seat ahead of the election. Meanwhile,\u00a0moderate Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., came out in favor of the Senate acting on the Supreme Court nomination, as did vulnerable Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz. Other votes potentially in play\u00a0are Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. Where they and other potential swing senators stand on a confirmation vote is likely to become more clear as the week goes on and especially after Trump names a nominee. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What is clear is that the 2020 presidential and U.S. Senate elections are no longer chiefly about the coronavirus pandemic or the economic crisis or race riots or the perceived morality of Biden or Trump. They are but a battleground in a massive culture war the scale of which is likely to be exacerbated by all of those factors. \"If McConnell jams someone through, which he will, there will be riots,\" warned GQ writer Laura Bassett. \"Burn Congress down before letting Trump try to appoint anyone to SCOTUS,\" Canadian political science professor Emmet Macfarlane tweeted. Fox News' Nick Givas, Sam Dorman, Chad Pergram and Paul Conner\u00a0contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republican discusses vital Senate runoff election in exclusive interview with 'The Ingraham Angle' Rev. Raphael Warnock is the Democratic candidate in one of two\u00a0heated runoff elections for\u00a0Georgia Senate seats\u00a0taking place on Tuesday. Warnock\u2019s competitor is incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to fill former\u00a0Sen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s seat last January. In the Nov. 3 election,\u00a0Loeffler was also challenged by a\u00a0Republican,\u00a0Rep. Doug Collins, who came in third. On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden and President Trump\u00a0were in the Peach State stumping for their candidates, with\u00a0the Senate majority hanging in the balance. Here are three things to know about\u00a0Warnock, a\u00a0first-time political candidate. Religious roots Warnock, 51, has served as a senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta since 2005, which is the same church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Both of Warnock\u2019s parents were also Pentecostal preachers. In this June 23, 2020, file photo, Rev. Raphael G. Warnock delivers the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks' funeral at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. (Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool) Former President Obama invited Warnock to deliver the closing prayer at the 2013 Inaugural Prayer Service held at the National Cathedral and the sermon for the Annual White House Prayer breakfast in March 2016. Warnock has referred to his campaign efforts as the \"Rev Up the Vote\" tour. He is recently divorced and has two children. Protest-related arrests Warnock was arrested during 2014 protests over GOP-led decisions not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, he was once again arrested during peaceful protests over\u00a0budget cuts to social programs that were being proposed by President Trump. Progressive views As his experiences with protest movements might suggest, Warnock is a progressive. His campaign website lists\u00a0reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and climate change as some of his top issues. GEORGIA SEN. PERDUE PULLS OUT OF FINAL DEBATE AFTER BITTER CLASH AT PREVIOUS FACE-OFF Warnock\u2019s candidacy gained ground alongside the massive civil unrest that gripped the country throughout 2020, including outrage over the deaths of Black individuals like Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks at the hands of police. After Loeffler criticized the WNBA for dedicating its season to the Black Lives Matter movement, the team she owns \u2013 the Atlanta Dream \u2013 donned shirts advocating for Warnock.

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., will stump in New Hampshire Thursday for Joe Biden, making her the first \u201cSquad\u201d member to officially campaign for the Democratic presidential nominee. When Pressley last visited the state 10 months ago, she was campaigning for then-presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at a New Hampshire Young Democrats event. Pressley was the only \u201cSquad\u201d member not to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. OMAR MOBILIZING PROGRESSIVES TO PUSH BIDEN LEFT Four electoral votes are up for grabs in the swing state and both candidates are making a push to win the state that then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton claimed\u00a0 in 2016. President Trump on Sunday held his own rally in Manchester, N.H., while Sanders has visted the state to stump for Biden. Meanwhile, her fellow Squad members have promised their progressive supporters to push Biden to the left if he wins the White House. Pressley\u2019s first of two stops will be a meet-and-greet with University of New Hampshire students, followed by a get-out-the-vote event in Portsmouth, N.H. AYANNA PRESSLEY CHALLENGER SAYS SHE WAS ATTACKED AT TRUMP RALLY Pressley\u2019s efforts will focus on women voters. \u201cAt each campaign stop, Pressley will discuss the issues that are at stake for women in the 2020 election, from access to affordable health care, to protecting reproductive rights, to the future of our planet,\u201d New Hampshire Democratic Party officials\u00a0told WMUR. \u201cWhile Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a plan to make health care more affordable and accessible, to ensure we get closer to full inclusion of and equality for women, and to address climate change, Donald Trump and Republicans have been a disaster for women and families,\u201d the party said. Meanwhile, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., asserted the progressives would push Biden to the left on key issues. \"We will have a cohort of progressives that are very clear about their objectives for wanting the implementation of 'Medicare-for-all' and a Green New Deal and raising the minimum wage and not allowing for fracking,\" she said in an interview with Axios. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden has not expressed explicit support for the Green New Deal or \"Medicare-for-all\"\u00a0but has similar climate and health care plans; his website calls the Green New Deal a \"crucial framework,\" and he has said he plans on expanding ObamaCare to make it \"BidenCare.\" His stance on fracking and the oil industry has flip-flopped over the course of his campaign.",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., held a joint press conference on Sunday regarding the Supreme Court vacancy left behind following the passsing of\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and urged the country to pressure Republicans into delaying\u00a0President Trump's potential nominee\u00a0until after the November election. Schumer, who spoke from\u00a0James Madison High School in Brooklyn where Ginsburg was an\u00a0alumnus, claimed that a\u00a0Trump court nominee would increase global warming, decimate voting rights and set the country back decades. He also asked for two more Republican senators to cross party lines and\u00a0promise to only vote on a nominee\u00a0after the presidential contest is decided. \"We're here to protect the rights\u00a0of women -- their rights to their body, to choose, their rights to health\u00a0care and equality would go down\u00a0the drain if that wish were not\u00a0realized,\" Schumer said. \"A court with a kind of nominee\u00a0President Trump will choose will\u00a0undo all of that and not make\u00a0global warming less likely but\u00a0more likely and it will come\u00a0quicker...\u00a0We do not want to turn\u00a0the clock back.\u00a0And we only need two more\u00a0senators who will abide by\u00a0RGB's wish.\u00a0Two said it.\u00a0We need two more.\" So far Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have signaled that they oppose holding a Senate confirmation hearing before this year's general election. Schumer\u00a0referred to Ginsburg as a \"saintly\" and\u00a0\"brilliant\" woman\u00a0who deserves\u00a0to have her wishes honored. Ginsburg told her daughter shortly before her death that she wanted the person who would fill the seat she vacated to be selected after the election. The New York lawmaker on Sunday\u00a0also cited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision to refuse Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the high court, as precedent for such a delay. Ocasio-Cortez was then given the mic and almost immediately called on political activists to begin organizing and targeting Republican lawmakers who are slated to vote on the next Justice. TRUMP PROMISES TO NOMINATE A WOMAN TO FILL SUPREME COURT VACANCY \"With an early appointment, all\u00a0of our rights... that so many\u00a0people died for -- voting rights, reproductive rights, health care\u00a0rights all of those rights are\u00a0at risk with this appointment,\" she said. \"So we need to make sure that\u00a0we mobilize on an\u00a0unprecedented scale to ensure that this vacancy is reserved for the\u00a0next president. And we must use\u00a0every tool at our disposal - from\u00a0everyday people, especially in\u00a0swing states.\u00a0We need everyday people to call\u00a0on senators, to call on folks on the\u00a0bubble... to ensure that we buy\u00a0ourselves the time necessary.\" \"We all need to be more\u00a0courageous and we all must act\u00a0in unprecedented ways to make\u00a0sure that our rights are\u00a0stabilized,\" she\u00a0added. \"And to Mitch\u00a0McConnell, we need to tell him\u00a0that he is playing with fire.\u00a0We need to make sure that this\u00a0vacancy is protected, that our\u00a0election continues and that the\u00a0American people have their say.\" Ginsburg passed away Friday at the age of 87 from complications stemming from her ongoing battle with pancreatic cancer. The president's reelection campaign shared a statement with Fox News on Sunday about Trump's intention is to fill the vacancy as quickly as possible\u00a0and to do so with a female nominee. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Voters elected Donald J. Trump president in 2016 and gave Republicans an expanded majority in 2018, so the people already have spoken,\"\u00a0communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a\u00a0statement.

BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Brit Hume, in for Chris Wallace. President Trump selects his Supreme Court nominee just days before his first debate with Joe Biden right here in Cleveland. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today, it is my honor to nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett. HUME: The noted judicial conservative nominated to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat. This hour, we're joined by Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, who knows Barrett from her days clerking for his father, the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Plus -- SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Justice Ginsburg must be turning over in her grave up in heaven. HUME: We'll ask Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow about Democrats strategy to slow the process, and get reaction from Senator John Kennedy, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Then -- PROTESTERS: Health care for everyone! HUME: What will the likely shift in the courts make up means for issues central to Americans lives? We'll discuss that with former independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Harvard Law scholar Laurence Tribe. And our Sunday panel on how the nomination battle could upend the November election. All, right now, on \"FOX News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) HUME: And hello again from FOX News in Cleveland. We are live on the campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic, the site of the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, moderated by our very own Chris Wallace, who is preparing today. The Supreme Court vacancy, President Trump's third and his selection of Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee add a new twist to Tuesday night's debate. We'll begin with FOX team coverage. Mark Meredith is at the White House and Jacqui Heinrich in Wilmington, Delaware. Let's start with the latest on the president's Supreme Court pick and what we know about the timeline for a confirmation process -- Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Brit, President Trump hopes to fire up his base with his new Supreme Court nominee but with Election Day fast approaching, the White House knows getting Judge Barrett confirmed by the Senate will be contentious. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: Is a very proud moment indeed. MEREDITH: Late Saturday, President Trump made it official. He is nominating Seventh Circuit Appeals Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court TRUMP: She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution. MEREDITH: Barrett, a favorite of the conservative establishment, is a practicing Catholic, graduate of Notre Dame, and former clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: His judicial philosophy is mine too. A judge must apply the law as written. MEREDITH: Democrats are outraged Republicans are pushing Barrett's nomination forward just five weeks before the election after Republicans blocked President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland for the same reason in 2016. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats are concerned with Barrett's record on abortion and religion. SCHUMER: I will strongly, strongly, strongly oppose this nomination. MEREDITH: Two GOP senators say they will not vote in the nominee before the election but the majority of Republicans appear ready to hold hearings, and Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham says his committee will hold four days of confirmation hearings beginning the week of October 12th. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: The president told reporters last night he thinks Barrett's confirmation will move fairly fast and as he believes a confirmation vote, Brit, will happen before Election Day -- Brit. HUME: Mark Meredith reporting for the White House, thank you, Mark. Now, let's turn to Jacqui Heinrich, who is covering the Biden campaign in Wilmington, Delaware. Hi, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Brit. Joe Biden hopes pressuring vulnerable Republican senators about health care amid the pandemic can stall the confirmation process. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH: Joe Biden is hedging his bets on coronavirus fears, warning of Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed and the Affordable Care Act is overturned, complications from COVID-19 like lung scarring and heart damage could become the next deniable pre-existing condition, writing: Barrett has a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision upholding the Affordable Care Act. She critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts' majority opinion upholding the law in 2012. Democrats hope the threat of retaliation from angry voters could persuade Senate Republicans in tight races to push the vote past election day and Biden is offering the election-year standard the GOP set four years ago as a way out, urging no action until after November 3rd. Biden is resisting talk about nuclear options like court-packing if Judge Barrett is confirmed, instead turning the focus to President Trump's refusal to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses. BIDEN: What I do -- am concerned about is whether he generates some kind of response in a way that unsettles the society or causes some -- some kind of violence. The last thing we need is a -- you know, the equivalent of a coup. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH: Biden was slated for a light schedule as he's been heavy into debate prep, including mock debates with an advisor playing the role of President Trump. But early this morning, he announced surprised remarks on the Supreme Court vacancy coming up later this afternoon -- Brit. HUME: Jacqui -- Jacqui Heinrich reporting from Wilmington, Delaware, thank you, Jacqui. Joining me now is our secretary of labor, Eugene Scalia. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us today. EUGENE SCALIA, SECRETARY OF LABOR: Brit, thank you, it's a pleasure. HUME: Let me start, I know you know Judge Barrett going back a number of years. And I wanted you to just give us quickly how you would characterize her. What kind of person is she? SCALIA: Well, she is a beloved teacher, a very respected scholar. I think she has shown herself to be a thoughtful jurist. And she's just a wonderful, warm, admirable human being as well. Mother to seven, mother to school-age children. She is a very impressive, delightful person. I think the American people as they come to know her are going to find her very admirable in so many ways. HUME: Let's get to the question of her record then. We're now -- it's now becoming clear, at least at the outset, that the issue on which she will be challenged by Democrats is health care and particularly the Affordable Care Act, which is coming up for action by the Supreme Court at some point in the near future. The assertion is being made that she is likely to vote not to uphold the act and therefore put an end to it. What do you make of that claim? SCALIA: It's a red herring, Brit. I think it reflects -- HUME: How so? SCALIA: -- a bit of frustration on the part of the Democrats on how they might attack her nomination. She made a comment about the Affordable Care Act decision a number of years ago before she was a judge. It was a comment that a number of people made at the time. It's not a question that will be before the court in the case that's coming up. And there's absolutely zero reason to believe that Judge Barrett is somebody who has -- does not have the views about the importance of health care. As I said, she's a working mother to school-age children. She is the mother to a child with disability. The suggestion that she is opposed to health care is absurd. HUME: All right, well, let my drill down a little bit farther on that question about the comments she made. What did she say about the Affordable Care Act? And I guess it was about John Roberts's decision in the case to treat the Affordable Care Act's penalties as a tax. What about -- what did she say exactly that you think is not likely to lead to a decision one way or the other? SCALIA: I believe that she made the observation that it appeared that the chief justice had bent over backwards to twist the language of that statute to save its constitutionality. That was a criticism that a number of people made at the time. By the way, it was something that other people praised the chief justice for. A number of people said the justice did the right thing by, in their view, going out of his way to save the statute. So it was a very common view at the time. I think the most important thing to know about Judge Barrett's jurisprudence is that she will go where the law takes her. Her view of judging is that any personal views she may have on health care or any other matter you can name is not relevant to determining what Congress wrote and what's in our Constitution. Her authority derives from those documents. She understands that and she will follow the lead of the Constitution and its original meaning and the text of what Congress wrote. HUME: I understand that the issue that will come before the court is whether the Affordable Care Act, with its tax or penalty, now were zeroed out, so there's actually no actual monetary penalty for not having insurance. With that out, then how can it stand as a tax, correct? SCALIA: I believe that's the question, Brit, but again, we're talking about -- (CROSSTALK) HUME: Well, while -- let me just interrupt you -- SCALIA: -- an extraordinarily qualified person with a great record of achievement. And there's no single case by which you should judge her qualification for the court. She will be addressing cases for years, probably decades. HUME: Understood, but let me just push you just a little farther on this, if you don't mind, sir. If she believes that the idea that it was a tax, as articulated by the chief justice, was kind of far-fetched, why would we not then believe that when the issue came before the court with the tax zeroed out that she wouldn't then say that the constitutional basis for demanding or ordering people to have health care, mandating health care -- health insurance, I should say, is unconstitutional? SCALIA: Because by the very fact that the tax no longer is there, the question whether it's a tax or not is moot, it's gone. It's a totally different case, Brit. And, again, the fact that this is being raised shows that the Democrats are casting about for anything by which they might seek to oppose an exceptional nominee. The other thing I expect we may hear about is her faith, which, as you know, was something she was attacked for last time. The Democrats embarrassed themselves when they did it. But they've done it with other nominees. We had a nominee of the president to a court a little more than a year ago who was attacked for being a member of the Knights of Columbus, which is a Catholic organization, has existed for more than a century. And Senator Hirono of Hawaii and Senator Kamala Harris both attacked this man for being a member of the Knights of Columbus, which is just a Catholic organization that accepts Catholic faith. So I think we will see all manner of criticisms, but it can't change the fact that she really is -- (CROSSTALK) HUME: Well, speaking of -- SCALIA: -- a wonderful person and exceptional nominee. HUME: Well, very quickly then, speaking of organizations, she has said to be a member of a group called People of Praise, which is a kind of ecumenical Christian group, exists in many countries, has a number of members in this country. What do you know about People of Praise? And do you have any idea of why people seem so afraid of that? SCALIA: Well, it is, as you said, a Christian group that has spread about the world. It's one of any number of groups that Catholics associate themselves with to deepen their faith, deepen their spirituality, serve others. It has been suggested that because she's a member of this group she may have a submissive view of women's role in society, which is ridiculous. This is an incredibly accomplished scholar, a teacher who won the best teacher award three times at Notre Dame Law School. She has done amazing things. It's actually quite insulting to suggest that she has a submissive view of women's role in society, quite sexist. And by the way, that's not what her critics are worried about. They are worried not that she's meek and mild, but that she's a very thoughtful, articulate, learned judge who will be, I think, a wonderful addition to the court. HUME: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much, thanks for joining us today. Up next, we'll speak with two members of the Senate about the upcoming confirmation process of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, as \"FOX News Sunday\" reports from the campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic, ahead of the first presidential debate. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HUME: Senate Republicans have laid out a speedy confirmation process for the president's Supreme Court pick. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not said whether a final vote will come -- become before or after the November 3rd election. So, joining us now is Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who will be one of those obviously with a chance to vote in this nomination. Senator Stabenow, very much -- very nice to see you, ma'am. Is there any chance you might vote for -- SEN. DEBBIE STABENOW (D-MI): Good to be with you. Good to be with you, Brit. HUME: Thank you. Any chance you might vote for this nominee? STABENOW: Well, Brit, first, let me say, congratulations to Amy Coney Barrett. This is always in honor of course to be nominated to the highest court in the land. So I want to congratulate her for that. For me, this is all about in the middle of a health pandemic, once-in-a- lifetime health pandemic, and it's very clear from her writings, multiple writings that she will be the vote that takes away health care for millions of Americans, including people -- 130 million people and counting with pre- existing conditions. And, of course, those are going up every day because of the health pandemic. HUME: Right, let me stop you if I can -- STABENOW: So I'm deeply, deeply concerned about that. (CROSSTALK) HUME: Let me ask you what specific writings you are citing that would mean she would definitely be a vote not to uphold the Affordable Care Act? STABENOW: Well, I think your questioning of former guest, Secretary Scalia, makes it clear when she was laying out her criticisms of the court for not essentially repealing it sooner. And, you know, Brit, what's most important here we know that President Trump and Senate -- and Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act since they took office. The Congress said no. And so, this is the last chance, you put someone on the Supreme Court that will do it and that even though people in Michigan didn't want the law to be repealed, they want their health care, and I would say that the response has got to be to put a president in who's going to protect and strengthen their health care. HUME: I hear you, Senator. Let me just say -- let me just follow up on that a little bit further if I can. The remark that I mentioned to Secretary Scalia was one in which he had commented in passing, critically, of John Roberts' determination that the penalties afforded under the Affordable Care Act for not carrying insurance amounted to a tax and not -- not just a penalty. That viewpoint, by the way has been widely criticized. And now that the tax penalty has been eliminated, there's no tax at all, what makes you think that that remark would lead to her naturally and automatically, inevitably voting not to uphold the Affordable Care Act? STABENOW: Well, Brit, it's called common sense. The number one priority of the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has been to take away people's health care and they've been trying actually for ten years, even before President Trump -- by the way, with no replacement. They want to take it away. And he certainly has given every indication that he wants the Supreme Court to act in the favor of the case that he has supported. He has helped to bring this case to the United States Supreme Court. Does anybody really think -- you know, common sense will tell you, he's going to put somebody on the court who has given all kinds of clues and writings about this issue. And I tell you, the people of Michigan are really worried. (CROSSTALK) HUME: I can understand, but you say all kinds of clues. What other clues other than this remark that was cited in my interview with Secretary Scalia? What other clues, Senator? STABENOW: She has -- well, we will lay all of this out in judicial -- judiciary hearings. And I don't want to get -- debate all the legalese back-and-forth with you today because I think there's a bigger picture here, which is people's healthcare. And I do have to say from a Michigan perspective, we have people right now just holding on. You know, over 200,000 people have lost their lives. They are holding on and they're saying, why aren't you focused on another COVID package that's going to help my family keep a roof over our head and food on the table and help our small businesses be able to open safely? And please help us with our schools. We -- we can't get the testing support, the other things we need to open the school safely, and my own family trying to juggle Zooming for a kindergartner and a third grader. And so, instead of dealing with right -- what's right in front of people right now that is causing them real pressure, what we have is a rush to judgment to put somebody on the court that's going to take away people's health care. Brit, I just don't get it. HUME: Well -- well, I understand your view. Let me just say if you wanted (ph) -- by virtue of the fact that you just congratulated Judge Barrett on her appointment, may I take it that you therefore believe it is legitimate for the president to have made the appointment? STABENOW: Well, we know this, it certainly legitimate for him to make nomination. We also know it's clear in the record in the Senate that between July and November of a presidential election year, there has never been a confirmation of the United States Supreme Court justice. Never. Either party, never happened. We are right now in the middle of voting in Michigan. We're already voting. We're being asked to vote four days before Election Day on whether or not a nominee will go on the court with a very high likelihood of overturning their health care, taking away their health care protections -- right when they're voting between a president who wants to do that and a nominee, Vice President Joe Biden, who said very clearly he's going to protect and strengthen their health care. And, by the way, if we have a Democratic Senate, we're going to join him in making sure that happens. HUME: Senator Stabenow, very nice of you to take the time with us today. Thank you very much. Now let's turn to a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee where those hearings will take place, Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana. Welcome back to Fox News Sunday, Senator. Nice to have you. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R-LA): Thank you, Brit. Nice to be here. HUME: Now let me get your reaction -- we can now see, I think pretty clearly, the outlines of the case, at least a big part of the case is going to be made by Democrats against Judge Barrett, which is that she will be an inevitable vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act as it now exists. What's your reaction to that? SEN. KENNEDY: Senator Stabenow is my colleague and I consider Debbie a friend, so I say this gently, sell crazy somewhere else, we're all stocked up here. Unless Debbie is clairvoyant, I don't think she knows how the nominee is going to vote or any other member of the United States Supreme Court. But Debbie makes the point the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in terms of the role of the Supreme Court, my Democratic friends think the Supreme Court ought to be a mini Congress, they're politicians without robes, they don't even need to hear cases. They already know how they're going to vote. And that's part of the problem. That's not how I view the appropriate role of the Supreme Court. And I don't think that is how it operates. You're going to see a lot of evidence -- (CROSSTALK) -- accusations -- sure. HUME: Senator, let me just ask you this -- SEN. KENNEDY: Go ahead. HUME: -- about the very process and the fact of the nomination. You, of course, were around when the nomination was made of Merrick Garland and the Senate simply refused to take it up in any way. And the case was made by Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, that the American people this closest (ph) in an election year, which that was, back when President Obama nominated Judge Garland, should have a say in a Supreme Court nomination made that close to an election. Now it seems that the roles are reversed. A president has made a nomination. It is an election year, indeed it is very close to the election, and the view, and the other Republicans are prepared to move forward with this, in -- which is, distinct, obviously, from the course you took just four years or so ago. They are being accused of hypocrisy and double standards. How do you answer? SEN. KENNEDY: Well, let me finish my last point first, to Debbie and my colleagues in the Senate. I hope they let us have a respectful process. We don't need another freak show. I mean, I hope they won't get into the foothills of KiKi (ph) and bring back Michael Avenatti and all that other stuff. Let us focus on the nominee. Now to answer your question, I'm rather fond of the Constitution. I have read it. Its provisions about filling a Supreme Court vacancy are unaffected by the electoral calendar. I realize that on both sides, Brit, there's been a lot of circumlocution and attempted Churchillian rhetoric about the president to be followed during an election year to fill a vacancy. Here's as best as I can tell, here's the rule. When the Democrats are in charge of the process, they do what they think is right, consistent with the Constitution. When the Republicans are in charge of the process, they do what they think is right. And I think that's what our founders intended. I think our founders intended elections to have consequences and when they send people to Washington of a particular party, they expect them to represent their voters. And I think that's been the tradition and the precedent. HUME: It appears from a constitutional point of view that you are spot on with that. The Constitution certainly doesn't say anything, as you point out, about the electoral process in terms of the appointment of confirmation of Supreme Court justices. But would you not acknowledge that what we have here is a serious case on both sides on this issue of shoe on the other foot disease? SEN. KENNEDY: Sure, absolutely. And that's why I say if you -- in Washington, as you know better than I do, Brit, you have to watch what people do, not what they say. And if you watch what has happened, in the history of ever, I don't think there's ever been another instance where when the Democrats were in charge they didn't do what they wanted and when the Republicans were in charge they didn't do what they wanted. Consistent with the Constitution. Right now we have a Republican president, we have a Republican Senate. If that shoe were on the other foot, then I can assure you Senator Schumer would do what the Republicans are doing right now. As I said the other day, if you don't believe that, you probably peaked in high school. HUME: So you're hoping, as I'm sure others are as well, that we will have something other than what you called a freak show in this, but there is some real history here, the Kavanaugh nomination being only the most recent example. Previously we had late and unexpected allegations made of sexual misconduct against now Justice Clarence Thomas. Is it your sense that the Senate's appetite for allowing this kind of thing to go on is diminished? Because otherwise, if something like this comes along, I'm not sure what you can do about it. What can you do? SEN. KENNEDY: Well, if my Democratic friends want to turn it into an intergalactic freak show and bring back the protesters with the genitalia shaped head gear, I can't stop them. I just hope they won't (ph). I'm going to do my job. I think she's a good nominee, but my job is to advise and consent. I'm going to probe her intellect, her temperament, her judicial philosophy, her character. I want to be assured that -- HUME: (INAUDIBLE). SEN. KENNEDY: -- she doesn't think justices are politicians in robes. I'm going to answer that in a second. I want to be assured that she's not one of these justices that tries to rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday to advance a political agenda that the voters won't accept. I don't think her faith -- I mean, if the Democrats (INAUDIBLE) if she believes in God, therefore she is unqualified, I don't think that's illegal in America. I hope not. We have religious freedom and it should be jealously guarded. They tried that when she came up for a Court of Appeal nomination. It didn't work out too well. They may try it again. As I say, before it's over with, they may bring back Michael Avenatti, but I hope so because it cheapens the process. I hope not rather. HUME: Senator Kennedy, thank you very much for joining us today. Always good to talk to you. Up next, we'll discuss how Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation could reshape the court with two leading experts on constitutional law as we count down here in Cleveland to the first presidential debate just a couple of days away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming up, Bernie Sanders tries to portray President Trump's comments as threat to democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy. And democracy must win. (END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Brit Hume returns with the Sunday panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HUME: Central to the fight over the next Supreme Court justice is the issue of abortion, which its proponents like to call women's reproductive rights, and the future of Roe vs. Wade. That's the decision, of course, that made abortion legal in America. We wanted to -- not only legal, but a constitutional right. We wanted to do a deeper dive on that upcoming court battle, so we invited former independent counsel and former federal appellate judge Ken Starr and Laurence Tribe, Harvard constitutional professor emeritus to discuss. Gentlemen, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Let me start with you, Professor Tribe. What is your -- let's give me -- give us quickly your view of this nomination. LAURENCE TRIBE, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, my view is that the nomination should certainly have awaited the results of the election. We've never, never jumped the gun this quickly. It's basically five weeks away. People are already voting. Whatever the rule might have been in the case of Merrick Garland, where the GOP kept the seat vacant for over 400 days. The idea that we need to rush ahead with a lifetime appointment, that as Judge Barrett herself would readily acknowledge will make a huge difference in the tilt of the court on health care, on women's reproductive rights, on voting rights, the idea that we can't wait a few days is ludicrous. There's no reason for it. HUME: I don't -- TRIBE: And I really think that the nomination is -- is misguided, quite apart from the nominee. I think quite well of Amy Coney Barrett, but that's not the issue. The issue is not the nominee, it's the nomination. They're not willing to wait because they really are nervous about what the American people believe the Constitution means and what they believe should be represented on the Supreme Court. HUME: Well, speaking -- well -- TRIBE: They also -- HUME: Well, speaking -- TRIBE: Yes, go -- no, go ahead. HUME: Speaking of the Constitution -- speaking of the Constitution, sir, do you find any support for your argument in the Constitution itself? TRIBE: Oh, I'm not suggesting it's unconstitutional to go ahead. It's perfectly constitutional. But a lot of things that are constitutional are stupid. This is not a good idea. What is it that they're afraid of? That the American people don't want to re-elect this president? If they think he'll be re-elected, and that they will have a Republican Senate, then they can confirm Amy Coney Barrett then. But the idea that it has to happen now, one of the reasons the president has given is, he wants to have a majority on the court to uphold his decision not to count all the ballots. He's said, if we don't count the ballots, if we toss some of them aside, we won't have to worry about a transition, it will just be a continuation of my presidency. That's not the way democracy works. That's the way dictatorship works. HUME: Judge Starr, your -- Judge Starr, your reaction, please, to the points that have been raised by Professor Tribe? KENNETH STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, first, I have great respect for Professor Tribe and no small affection for him. But I view it as the president's duty. There is a vacancy and it's tragic that we lost Justice Ginsburg, but, exactly, you ask the right question, what does the Constitution say? I don't think that the president, whoever the president is, should dillydally. And, in fact, Justice Sotomayor said in 2016, we really don't do well -- I'm paraphrasing, with eight members of the court. And Justice Ruth Ginsburg herself said at that same time. The president does not stopping being the president during an election year. So the president has done his duty and now, of course, it is up to the Senate to determine, are these considerations that Professor Tribe is articulating, are those weighty enough to say we're not going to go forward or we're going to wait until after the election and so forth. But the president has chosen a superb nominee. We saw that yesterday. And just no one is questioning her abilities, her integrity, her temperament and the like. So let's have a good confirmation hearing and air out all these issues, including how are you going to vote on some of these thorny questions? HUME: Well, let me get to that because it is being staged with some certainty by -- TRIBE: Can I say -- HUME: Well, just a second, Professor Tribe, let me just follow up here and -- and I'll get back to you. Professor Tribe was pretty specific about the issues on which he believes that he can predict or that it's clear how Judge Barrett will vote, abortion and a number of others that he mentioned. What's your reactions to that, Judge Starr? STARR: Absolutely premature and wrong. With all due respect to Professor Tribe, the judicial process is not an academic enterprise. What someone has said is an academic may -- and it's appropriate to explore that in the confirmation hearing. But to predict in advance how a justice going to behave or to vote I think is folly. I also think it's unfair to the process. That's why we have a judicial process. It's why you take an oath and that's why you read the briefs as a judge, you listen to the oral argument and you consult with your colleagues as well. Does she have a judicial philosophy? Absolutely. She has said she is of the school of Antonin Scalia. And so that's a great insight. And that is a -- what I would call a traditionalist who treats the Constitution not as simply an aspirational document, but as law. And so I would say, hold off, let's hear the confirmation hearings and see if she says, as I think she will, I solemnly promise that I will go about my duties with an open mind, I will listen to all the arguments and I will assess them with great, great respect for both sides as well as the views of my colleagues. HUME: Professor Tribe? TRIBE: Well, I don't pretend to have a crystal ball. I've just read her writings. I've read many of her opinions. It's clear how she approaches the law. It's a perfectly respectable view. It was the view Justice Scalia held. And, of course, he said he thought Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. She's written that Roe v. Wade is not entitled to determinative weight as a precedent. She has also been explicit in saying she thought that Chief Justice Roberts was wrong in stretching what he understood the Affordable Care Act meant in order to uphold it. She's been admirably candid about her views -- HUME: What did you think of that view, by the way? What did you think -- what did you -- what did you think -- right, but let -- what did you think about what Justice Roberts -- how Justice Roberts ruled on that matter, whether it was a tax or a penalty? What did you think of that as a constitutional lawyer? TRIBE: I -- I made clear at the time that I thought that's what he would rule and that that's what he ought to rule in order to avoid a constitutional conflict. That is, interpret the law as a tax in order to use the broad taxing power in order to uphold it. And I think the lower court, which said that when the tax goes away, it's no longer possible to uphold the law and even the protection for people with pre-existing conditions goes away. I think, and most scholars think, that that went way too far. Now, I'm not going to predict exactly what Judge Barrett will do on that, but what is clear is she is being rushed through in a confirmation process that will be faster than any in recent memory because they want to have -- HUME: All right. TRIBE: Six conservatives on the court -- HUME: Let me -- TRIBE: That will determine whether he is remaining president. HUME: Judge Starr, very quickly, give me about 15 seconds, I'm sorry, we're almost out of time, I just want to give you the last word here. STARR: Predictions are fallacious. Let's have a confirmation hearing. The history of confirmation shows that the Senate can move forward very, very quickly, especially when you have someone with a very good and solid record and a person of such great ability. So let's move the process forward and have a good, robust debate, which I think will be good for the country. HUME: Judge Starr, Professor Tribe, thank you very much, both of you, for your perspectives as this confirmation process gets underway. TRIBE: Thank you. STARR: Thank you. HUME: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what's at stake on Tuesday night's debate and with this nomination when FOX NEWS SUNDAY returns from Cleveland. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Why are they committing a power grab so egregious that it risks shedding the last vestiges of trust that remain between our two parties? SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The sky is falling when a Democratic president does not get to confirm every last judge he or she wants. And the sky is falling when a Republican president gets to confirm any -- any judges. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUME: Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell giving us a sort of preview of the Senate battle ahead over President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Time now for our Sunday panel. GOP strategist Karl Rove, https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__townhall.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=lGzOdBATBLGbFW1WTWos7Uxm7OS-m4HSkX6dRS7cu8E&s=Tc900rN8B_o0MG6Dfc_r6oDn2RIodyRG5fbuQNtYOv0&e= editor Katie Pavlich, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams. Well, the Republicans are speaking with great confidence about their prospects and we're hearing that the votes are there. Certainly the votes are there to bring up the nomination. But, Karl, how confident can we be just -- give me your best thought -- that the votes will be there when all is said and done given the kind of processes we've had before? KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Judge Barrett went through this in 2017 and passed out of the Senate with Republican support. I suspect a very strong likelihood that this time around the result will be the same. I think it's interesting though that the Democrats have -- are making sort of I think strange arguments. You heard Senator Stabenow, for example, really ion essence imply there was a prearranged agreement between the president and Justice Barrett that she would vote to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and then she railed on the Senate for taking up this matter rather than passing another Covid relief package. This is a matter of days after she voted against the Senate even taking up the Republican proposal for another round of Covid relief. So this is going to be politics, politics, politics, but it's going to end with her on the Supreme Court. HUME: Katie. KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it's very clear that Democrats are taking this with the political health care argument. The insinuation that they know how Judge Barrett would rule on Obamacare is something that they don't know about and judges frequently, during these confirmation hearings, whether they are for a federal bench or the Supreme Court, do not reveal how they would vote on pending cases. So I think that Democrats will be very frustrated with that. But you had Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe on in the previous segment. I think the way that he summed up how he feels about Republicans moving forward with the constitutional process really defines how the left is moving forward with their philosophy on this. He said, well, it's constitutional for the president to appoint a nominee and for the Senate to move forward on advise and consent, but there are number of stupid things in the Constitution. So while Republicans are moving forward with the constitutionality of this and while Judge Barrett continues to say that her political feelings personally and her policy positions do not reflect how she rules on a number of cases, Democrats continue to argue that because they have some feelings about the timing of this, that the Constitution should be pushed aside, which is in direct conflict with what Barrett said yesterday at the White House in saying that she will -- she loves the Constitution. She would move forward in the constitutional process and she will not make law from the bench, but rather interpret it. HUME: Juan, your -- where -- where do you come out on all this? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Brit, I think the Democrats have a choice here. I mean one choice is they could shun Barrett, not grantor here a meeting, stay away from the hearings, which is what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland for ten months, not just six weeks. But I think it's most likely now, from what I'm hearing, they will go to the hearings. I don't know about the meetings, but they'll go to the hearings and they will focus on the idea that this is a rushed process. They will note that many Republican senators, even before we knew it was going to be Amy Coney Barrett as the nominee, said they would vote for whoever President Trump nominated. So they will focus on that and they will focus on the idea, as we've heard earlier in this show, that she is an opponent of, you know, the continuation likely of the Affordable Care Act, but also in terms of gay rights, abortion, and maybe most of all that any dispute in the election would be decided by her in the president's favor and that would, of course, decide who the next president of the United States is. HUME: Well, Juan, do you think there's any chance that those arguments on the Affordable Care Act and the rushed process will peel away any Republican votes? Because he -- in order to block this nomination, Republicans have a majority, a very narrow one, but a majority nonetheless, those arguments would have to sway Republicans. Could those arguments do that, Juan? WILLIAMS: You know, it's a matter of conscience at this point. And what we've seen is a unified Republican front behind Senator McConnell, the majority leader in the Senate, Brit. So it would have to be that somebody, either as a matter of conscious, or I would say potentially somebody who's in a tough re-election fight for their Senate seat, decides that it's untenable. But, at this juncture, I don't see anything like that. HUME: Karl, what do you think? ROVE: No, I don't -- I don't think so. Look, most of the Republican senators were there in 2017, many of whom were there in 2017 and voted to put her on the Seventh Circuit when we went through a similar circus. This is where Dianne Feinstein attacked her Catholic faith by saying, quote, the dogma live strongly within you. But, look, the -- members of the Senate are allowed to exercise their constitutional authority. The president, under Article Two, Section Two, Clause Two has the right to nominate and the Senate has the right to give or withhold its advise and consent. And what's interesting to me is, is Senator Schumer was a leader of the effort to withhold -- they never gave a vote to Miguel Estrada, nominated by President Bush, and -- and nothing was wrong with that by them exercising their authority. HUME: Yes. (INAUDIBLE). Katie, what do you think the chances are that this affects the election one way or the other? PAVLICH: I think the chances are 100 percent, Brit, especially for Republican voters who put more senators -- Republican senators in the Senate in 2018 based on the Supreme Court issue after the bruising fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. President Trump has been very transparent since the beginning of his presidency four years ago in releasing a list of Supreme Court nominees he would put on the court if he had the chance. HUME: So -- right. PAVLICH: So he's given everybody including Democrats a preview of this and plenty of time to prepare for what's coming. HUME: I -- I understand, but what -- what about -- but what about the effect of this nomination -- and let's just assume for the sake of discussion that it -- she's confirmed, what is the effect, if any, on the election, quickly? PAVLICH: Well, I think Democrats who feel like this has been rushed through too quickly may get some more enthusiasm for Joe Biden, who, of course, needs that. And Republicans, I think, risk serious consequences in future elections if they were not to move forward with this nomination. HUME: So -- OK, Juan, your thoughts on the election and how it might be affected by this nomination? WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think there's any question, a majority of Americans think that it's wrong to rush the process. They think the next president should decide. Even a substantial number of Republicans. HUME: OK. WILLIAMS: So this is brute politics. HUME: So -- WILLIAMS: But in terms of the election, I think it excites the base of both parties. HUME: OK. Gentlemen, lady, thank you very much. See you next Sunday. PAVLICH: Thanks, Brit. HUME: Or you -- someone will, Chris, I suppose. WILLIAMS: Thanks, Brit. HUME: A look back on big -- up next, a look back on big moments of debates past as Donald Trump and Joe Biden prepared to go face-to-face here in Cleveland in two days. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HUME: In just two days, President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will finally face-off on the debate stage with our own Chris Wallace moderating, his second time at the helm of one of these debates. It is, obviously, a critical event for both candidates hoping to deliver a knockout performance as they always do hope that could generate momentum in the campaign's homestretch. First debates tend to be the most important ones. History has shown that impressions that are created in these first debates can sometimes be hard to overcome if they go against you and a great help if they go for you. President Donald Trump will return to the debate stage here in Cleveland, shortly, two days from now, on this very time, facing Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Be sure and tune in as Chris Wallace moderates the first debate. That's at 9:00 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday. We'll have special coverage starting tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern, anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. OK, we have a package here looking back on debates past. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The presidential candidates meet face-to-face in television debates heard and heard by millions of people. HUME (voice over): It is a famous anecdote, John F. Kennedy dazzling TV viewers while debating Richard Nixon, going on to win in November and setting a new precedent, bring you're A-game to the TV debates, leverage the visuals, nail the witty comebacks. Like Ronald Reagan's epic rejoinder when journalist Henry Trewhitt asked about his age. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (October 21, 1984): I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience. HUME: Or the smack down by Michael Dukakis' running mate Lloyd Bentsen of Dan Quayle comparing himself to JFK. LLOYD BENTSEN, MICHEL DUKAKIS' RUNNING MATE (October 5, 1988): I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy. HUME: In 2000 it was the nod, George W. Bush cheekily brushing off a looming Al Gore. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (October 17, 2000): But can you get things done? And I believe I can. HUME: And in 2012, President Barack Obama was ready when Mitt Romney talked military preparedness. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (October 22, 2012): You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military has changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers were planes land on them. HUME: In the 2016 debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, it was suddenly less about style and more about the unpredictable substance. CHRIS WALLACE, ABC NEWS (October 19, 2016): Where do you want to see the court take the country? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (October 19, 2016): I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. HUME: And key moments that shocked at the time and still loom large as we head into November. WALLACE (October 19, 2016): Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the results of this election? TRUMP (October 19, 2016): I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. WALLACE (October 19, 2016): Are you say you're not prepared now to commit to that principle? TRUMP (October 19, 2016): What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. (END VIDEOTAPE) HUME: It's going to be interesting on Tuesday. That's it for today from Cleveland. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Twenty years ago it was the state that decided the presidential election between then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. Bush won the state by five points in his 2004 presidential reelection. President Barack Obama carried the state by razor-thin margins in both 2008 and 2012. Then, four years ago Trump narrowly edged out 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. An average of the most recent polling in the state shows Biden holding a slight lower-single-digit lead over the president.",

Democrats took to social media to slam\u00a0President Trump's\u00a0choice of\u00a0Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0for the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0after the president's announcement Saturday night --\u00a0with one senator claiming the nomination is the result of an \"illegitimate process.\" Many of their posts related to the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, claiming Barrett, a judge on the\u00a07th Circuit Court of Appeals,\u00a0would threaten ObamaCare. TRUMP ANNOUNCES AMY CONEY BARRETT AS NOMINEE FOR SUPREME COURT SEAT Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u00a0responded by saying\u00a0\"vote like your health care is on the ballot \u2014 because it is.\" \"Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions,\" Biden said. \"The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress. Americans deserve to be heard.\" His running mate, 2020 vice presidential nominee\u00a0Kamala Harris, claimed in a tweet that the president's choice made it clear Republicans are intent on destroying the Affordable Care Act and overturning Roe v. Wade,\u00a0the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision on\u00a0abortion. \"This selection would move the court further right for a generation & harm millions of Americans,\" Harris said. \"I strongly oppose Judge Barrett\u2019s nomination.\" Former presidential candidates former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, D-Ind., and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also ripped into the nominee. \"This is about health care, reproductive rights, full equality for LGBTQ people, our planet, and so much more,\" wrote Buttigieg. \"The stakes of this struggle could not be higher.\" Warren said that who Barrett is \"in many ways doesn\u2019t matter.\" \"We know exactly what that person is being picked to do: complete a decades-long assault on our judiciary by billionaires and giant corporations to tilt the courts for the rich and powerful,\" she asserted. \"Amy Coney Barrett will work to gut Roe v. Wade and the ACA, taking away health care coverage from millions of Americans\u2014including those with pre-existing conditions,\" she tweeted minutes later. \"And make no mistake: Trump is counting on her to swing the Supreme Court in his favor when he loses this election.\" New York Democratic Sen. Kristen Gillibrand tweeted that Barrett's nomination is the \"product of a corrupt, illegitimate process that undermines the will of the American people.\" \"Alongside her dangerous, ultra-conservative record, she\u2019s not fit to serve on the Supreme Court,\" she added. In line with the Democrats' broader argument against Republicans' supposed hypocrisy, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom tweeted a video of Barrett from a 2016 CBS News interview regarding the filling of Justice Antonin Scalia's vacant seat. \"Here is Judge Amy Coney Barrett explaining why it\u2019s wrong to fill a SCOTUS vacancy during a presidential election year,\" Newsom wrote in a caption. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted that a vote for Barrett is a vote to \"eliminate health care for millions in the middle of a pandemic\" and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the president specifically -- not even naming Barrett. \"For four years, President Trump has tried to crush the Affordable Care Act,\" she wrote. \"With his Supreme Court nominee, he is threatening the destruction of every benefit and protection of the ACA, including life-saving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.\" California Democratic Rep.\u00a0Adam Schiff tweeted that Republicans were \"rushing\" Barrett into a lifetime appointment so she can strike down important health care and because, \"Republicans also fear they\u2019re losing the election and want her to deliver the election for Trump.\" \"No confirmation before [the] inauguration,\" he urged. Washington State Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee wrote that 718,000 Washingtonians stand to lose their health care coverage under Barrett, and others like Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Texas Senate candidate MJ Hegar slammed GOP members for rushing the confirmation through in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"If John Cornyn and his boss Mitch McConnell can rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, the Senate could've been a functional legislative body passing desperately needed COVID-19 relief and more,\" wrote Hegar. \"Instead they\u2019re pushing their partisan agenda to strip us of our health care.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Barrett, 48, is a former law professor at the University of Notre Dame and a mother of seven. A source familiar with the process told Fox News that Oct. 12 is the target date for the beginning of confirmation hearings. Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.",

The freshman \"Squad\" leader urged her supporters not to despair, but rather mobilize in a mass way because reproductive\u00a0rights, marriage equality, labor protections, climate change and health care were now all at a \"tipping point.\" SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG DEAD AT 87 \"Let this moment radicalize you,\" Ocasio-Cortez said late Friday in a social media video. \u201cLet this moment really put everything into stark focus because this election has always been about the fight of and for our lives. And if anything, tonight is making that more clear to more people than ever before.\u201d In an Instagram live video posted around 10:30 p.m, the freshman Democrat urged some 45,000 people watching to double-check\u00a0their voter registration immediately, organize for the election and reach out to friends and family to get them to turn out. \"I need you to be ready,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.

She spoke for about 40 minutes about the gravity of the vacancy and how important it was to keep up the fight for Democrats to win in November. She alluded to Joe Biden\u2019s unpopularity among progressives who preferred that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., be the party's nominee, but said November is about survival. \u201cWe\u00a0need to focus on voting for Joe Biden.

AMY CONEY BARRETT ACCEPTS SUPREME COURT NOMINATION, PLEDGES TO 'FAITHFULLY AND IMPARTIALLY' DISCHARGE DUTIES \u201cThe Senate shouldn\u2019t act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cAmericans deserve to be heard.\u201d Biden, this week, called Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s efforts to push a nominee through the Senate before Election Day an \u201cexercise in raw political power.\u201d Biden pointed to the controversy surrounding former President Barack Obama\u2019s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, and argued that \u201chaving made this their standard when it served their interest, they cannot, just four years later, change course when it doesn\u2019t serve their ends.\u201d Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or a vote on Garland\u2019s nomination,\u00a0citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. Biden has refused to release a list of potential Supreme Court picks should he be elected president, saying that he would make his nominations to the high court on a bipartisan basis. BIDEN SAYS SENATE SHOULD WAIT ON TRUMP SUPREME COURT NOMINEE DESPITE PAST COMMENTS \u201cIf I win, I will make my choice for the Supreme Court\u2014not as part of a partisan election campaign\u2014but as prior presidents did,\u201d Biden said last week. \u201cOnly after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate\u2014and seeking their advice before I ask for their consent.\u201d He added: \u201cAs everyone knows, I have made it clear that my first choice for the Supreme Court will make history as the first African American woman justice.\u201d The Trump campaign has criticized Biden for failing to release a list of his own, suggesting he is \u201chiding\u201d something. \u201cWe know he\u2019s a tool of the radical left, so the only answer must be that he doesn\u2019t want Americans to see the radical leftists he would appoint, with judicial histories littered with extremist rulings on issues like abortion, religious freedom, immigration, Second Amendment rights\u00a0and government regulation,\u201d Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News this week. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump\u2019s choice to nominate Barrett would \u201charm millions of Americans.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s hand-picked successor to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat makes it clear: they intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act & overturn Roe,\u201d Harris tweeted, referring to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. \u201cThis selection would move the court further right for a generation & harm millions of Americans,\u201d she said. Also Saturday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez also weighed in, saying the president\u2019s choice \u201cconfirms what we already knew.\u201d \u201cEverything we care about is at stake in this election. Health care is on the ballot. Reproductive rights are on the ballot. LGBTQ rights, voting rights, and workers\u2019 rights are on the ballot. The future of our planet is on the ballot,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an affront not simply to our values as a democracy, but to every organizer and activist who has fought, marched, and voted to make this country live up to its founding ideals.\u201d Perez added: \u201cWe must send a loud, clear, and unified message to Trump and every one of his Republican enablers at the ballot box in November by voting them out of office.\u201d The comments come after Trump formally nominated Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court from the White House Rose Garden Saturday. Coney Barrett accepted the nomination, pledging to \u201cdischarge the responsibilities of this job to the very best of my ability.\u201d TRUMP CAMPAIGN KEEPS PRESSURE ON BIDEN TO RELEASE LIST OF POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT PICKS \u201cI love the United States and I love the United States Constitution,\u201d she said Saturday. \u201cI will do equal right to the poor and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge my duties under the United States Constitution.\u201d Barrett went on to acknowledge what is likely to be a heated and controversial confirmation process. \u201cI have no illusions that the road ahead of me will be easy, for the short term or the long haul,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI never imagined I would find myself in this position. She added: \u201cI will meet the challenge with both humility and courage.\u201d Addressing members of the Senate, Barrett said: \u201cI will do my very best to demonstrate that I am worthy of your support.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris makes remarks at Florida Memorial University in Miami, Florida. Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris faced renewed scrutiny for her lack of press availability on Monday after she abruptly exited the stage after\u00a0a speech in North Carolina in which she criticized President Trump\u2019s bid to fill a Supreme Court seat before the election. Harris did not take any questions from the media after her speech at Shaw University, one of North Carolina\u2019s historically black colleges and universities. The event was closed to the general public and attended only by news reporters, according to the Fayetteville Observer. AMALA HARRIS CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF PRESS AVAILABILITY: 'WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF?' Aside from her role as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s running mate, Harris is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and will have a chance\u00a0to directly question Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's pick to fill the high court vacancy,\u00a0in any confirmation hearing that takes place prior to Nov. 3. In her speech, which was criticized by the research wing of the Republican National Committee, Harris ripped the GOP for moving forward with the nomination so close to an election. \u201cWe will not give up, and we will not give in,\" Harris said. \u201cWe will not let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress, that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other, spread to the United States Supreme Court.\" Harris has faced criticism for not taking questions from the press in recent days. Reporters from multiple outlets have questioned why Harris hasn\u2019t made herself available to the media, and Trump and members of his campaign staff have frequently complained that both Biden and Harris are being given a free pass when it comes to questions from the press. Fox News reported last week that Harris hasn\u2019t participated in a formal press conference or gaggle since she was announced as Biden\u2019s running mate in August. Trump nominated Barrett on Saturday for the Supreme Court seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until her death earlier this month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In her speech, Harris warned that Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court would endanger the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, as well as reproductive rights legislation. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the ACA just days after the election. \u201cJudge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s life than undoing the seminal decision in the court\u2019s history that made it clear a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump calls Biden 'destroyer' of jobs; Kristin Fisher reports. MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2013 Sarah Manjarrez and her husband drove from New York City to New Hampshire to see President Trump in person. Ahead of the president\u2019s Friday night speech in the key battleground state -- his\u00a0first campaign event since his nomination acceptance address Thursday night capped this week\u2019s Republican National Convention\u00a0-- Manjarrez pointed to the four-day affair as a potential game-changer in the 2020 presidential election. THE POLL POSITION BETWEEN BIDEN AND TRUMP COMING OUT OF THE CONVENTIONS \u201cI think this is definitely going to sway some people,\u201d she told Fox News hours before the president arrived. She\u2019s not alone among Trump supporters. Supporters of President Trump wait in line ahead of Friday evening's event at a hangar adjacent to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, on August 28, 2020 Marisa George, a young Trump campaign volunteer from nearby Salem, N.H., emphasized that \u201cthe convention usually always helps a candidate but this week the convention was very patriotic. They talked about everything from all he\u2019s done for the Black community, women, and also hitting on how he\u2019s helping the cities, so I think it will give him a boost.\u201d And George believes the president could get a bounce from the polls coming out the convention. She cited Trump\u2019s law-and-order message amid a summer of unrest from coast to coast over police brutality against minorities and systemic racism. Trump and fellow Republicans have accused Democrats of ignoring the violence that's flared in some cities where protests escalated into riots. \u201cHe\u2019s been encouraging different cities to let him call in the guard. He really wants to bring back law and order,\u201d she noted. \u201cA lot of people were calling in the last few nights saying they\u2019re sick of all of the unrest and that the RNC has been convincing them to vote for Trump. I think if Trump keeps doing what he\u2019s doing \u2012\u00a0rally\u00a0his base but\u00a0also getting the moderates and the independents \u2012\u00a0I think if he keeps doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s got a great chance.\u201d One of the president\u2019s goals was to use his convention nomination speech and the entire four-day convention to shake up\u00a0a contest that has seen him for months trailing\u00a0Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in national public opinion polling and, more importantly, in key\u00a0general election battlegrounds. The president is aiming for a reset in a race where his job combating the worst pandemic to strike the nation and the world in a century \u2013 and an economy\u00a0severely deflated by the coronavirus \u2013 are top on the minds of voters. TRUMP SPOTLIGHTS SECURITY, WARNS BIDEN WOULD END 'AMERICAN GREATNESS,' IN CONVENTION FINALE Rayla Campbell made the drive from Randolph, Mass. Campbell, a Trump supporter who is Black and who\u2019s also running for Congress as a write-in candidate, predicted that coming out of the Democratic and Republican conventions \u201cthe people that were on the fence, a lot of them independents, I think they are going to go towards the Republican side and vote for the president because of what we stand for, because we\u2019re just standing up there talking about American values.\u201d She stressed that the president and the GOP are \u201chealing our people and healing our country, standing up together and not pushing people down. We don\u2019t want to segregate. We\u2019ve already done that. That\u2019s what happens when you tear down history, you\u2019re bound to repeat it. We\u2019ve got to put the statues back up.\u201d Corinn Dahm of Berlin, Mass., noted that if people \u201cwatched the convention, they got a different message\u201d about the president. She highlighted that due to the convention, \u201cI think they will relate to him a lot more.\u201d Paul Senecal spent hours driving from Hyde Park, N.Y. The one-time independent said he just registered as a Republican \u201cbecause Trump\u2019s been doing the things he said he would do.\u201d New Hampshire was supposed to have been the site for Trump\u2019s second rally -- following Tulsa, Okla. -- but it was canceled a day ahead of its scheduled July 11 date. At the time, the Trump campaign and White House blamed the cancellation on a tropical storm that ended up never impacting the airport at Portsmouth, where the rally was supposed to have been held. The president later acknowledged the rally was scrapped due to health concerns over large gatherings of people amid the coronavirus pandemic. Attendees entering the event site on Friday had their temperatures checked, and masks were mandated. That\u2019s a big switch from the previous night, when many in the crowd of nearly 2,000 packed into the White House South Lawn were not wearing masks as they watched the president\u2019s convention address in person. Supporters of President Trump wait in line for a temperature check before as they arrive for the president's speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Friday, August 28, 2020. New Hampshire is the only remaining state in the region without a statewide mask mandate. But earlier this month Republican Gov. Chris Sununu did implement a mask mandate for any gathering with 100 or more people. The Trump campaign noted since formally announcing this event last weekend that masks would be required and would be provided to all attendees who didn\u2019t have one. George, the campaign volunteer, said that it appeared \u201ceveryone is fully willing to cooperate as long as it\u2019s coming from the Trump campaign. They emphasized to us we all have to wear masks, so we\u2019re all OK with it.\u201d Sununu \u2013 who\u2019s running for reelection for a third two-year term steering New Hampshire\u00a0\u2013 said this week that he\u2019ll greet the president as he arrives at the airport, but that he would not be staying for the event. The Republican governor noted he\u2019s been generally been taking precautions to avoid large crowds. The hangar adjacent to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in New Hampshire, where President Trump will hold his rally on Friday evening, Aug. 28, 2020. New Hampshire has held a special place in the president\u2019s political history. After narrowly losing the Iowa caucuses four years ago, Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide, launching him toward\u00a0the GOP presidential nomination and, eventually, the White House. Besides holding the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, New Hampshire for a generation has been a battleground state in the general election. Trump narrowly lost the state\u2019s four electoral votes four years ago by fewer than 3,000 votes to Democratic nominee\u00a0Hillary Clinton. New Hampshire is one of a handful of states Clinton narrowly captured that the Trump campaign\u2019s hoping to flip from blue to red. Trump campaign New Hampshire co-chair Fred Doucette told Fox News having the president in the state is a big boost. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very big statement for him to show up here first after his acceptance speech,\u201d the state representative from Salem emphasized. \u201cIt\u2019s a loud statement that New Hampshire is that important.\u201d Biden hasn\u2019t been in New Hampshire since February\u2019s presidential primary. The former vice president announced on Thursday that he\u2019d start resuming small scale in-person campaign events in key general election battleground states after Labor Day. While a campaign stop in the Granite State by Biden or vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris would be warmly welcomed by Granite State Democrats, state Democratic Party communications director Holly Shulman emphasized that \"what matters to voters in New Hampshire is will they have health after the election, will they have Social Security after the election, will they have access to reproductive health care after the election?\" She stressed that \u201cthe difference in this election and the issues and how much is at stake, that\u2019s what energizing voters right now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Some political insiders say Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has drifted away from the conservative bloc, providing hope for Democrats and angering Republicans. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 role as the court\u2019s new swing vote has become abundantly apparent in recent weeks, as he has been the deciding justice in several high-profile 5-4 decisions in which he sided with the court\u2019s liberal bloc --\u00a0providing hope for Democrats and angering Republicans. The jurist kept court watchers on their toes yet again this week, siding with the conservatives in a tight decision that delivered a win for the school choice movement on Tuesday. But in Monday\u2019s decision in June Medical Services v. Russo, Roberts sided with the liberal members to rule\u00a0against a Louisiana law restricting who can perform abortions, upholding precedent from a similar case in 2016 in which he was on the other side. This followed his vote in rejecting the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to rescind DACA and his vote in a 6-3 decision that prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BID TO END DACA PROGRAM \"The Supreme Court\u2019s entering Buffalo Springfield territory: 'There\u2019s something happening here,'\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after Monday\u2019s ruling.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, observed a similar trend after the DACA decision but was far less enthusiastic about it. \u201cOver recent years, more and more, Chief Justice Roberts has been playing games with the court to achieve the policy outcomes he desires,\u201d Cruz said on the Senate floor, before citing past instances of what he called \"sleight of hands\" by Roberts,\u00a0adding: \"This is becoming a pattern.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., celebrated Monday\u2019s ruling while pointing out that it went against Republican political preferences. \u201cThis is a major victory for reproductive rights. The Supreme Court has confirmed it over and over again: the decision to get an abortion is a constitutional right, whether extremist Republican legislators like it or not,\u201d Sanders tweeted. Well-known liberal law professor Laurence Tribe, who taught Roberts at Harvard, expressed pride for his former student after Monday\u2019s decision. \u201cAdding the Louisiana abortion decision to the DACA decision and the LGBTQ decision makes me especially proud of my former constitutional law student, Chief Justice John Roberts,\u201d Tribe tweeted. Roberts' history of separating himself from the court\u2019s conservative contingent in key cases goes back years. \u00a0In 2012, by siding with the liberal wing and reinterpreting an individual mandate as a tax, he allowed ObamaCare to be found constitutional. Additionally last year he joined with liberals again in shutting down the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add a citizenship question to the census. TRUMP DECRIES SUPREME COURT DECISIONS AS 'SHOTGUN BLASTS INTO THE FACE' OF CONSERVATIVES The recent decisions, however, appear to have particularly struck a chord. President Trump called them \u201cshotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.\u201d Even before Monday\u2019s abortion case, Trump indicated that he was not confident in the current makeup of the court, despite the majority of justices being Republican appointees. \u201cThe recent Supreme Court decisions, not only on DACA, Sanctuary Cities, Census, and others, tell you only one thing, we need NEW JUSTICES of the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump tweeted earlier this month. Yet Roberts is far from the first justice appointed by a Republican president to drift from the conservative bloc, and a number of Republican selections have famously moved even further left. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, both recent examples of swing vote justices, were appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Justice David Souter, who was chosen by President George H.W. Bush, often sided with the court\u2019s liberal contingent. In 1992\u2019s landmark Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court upheld the right to an abortion in a 5-4 decision. All five majority votes \u2013 O\u2019Connor, Kennedy, Souter, John Paul Stevens, and Harry Blackmun -- were appointed by Republicans. The opinion in Roe v. Wade, which first established abortion as a right, was written by Blackmun, who was tapped for the Supreme Court by President Richard Nixon. The late former Chief Justice Earl Warren, nominated by Dwight Eisenhower, also faced criticism from conservatives for the court's decisions. Several conservatives have expressed fear that Roberts is not even a swing vote, and that he has gone full liberal. \u201cJohn Roberts is an empty black robe who wants to be loved by liberals who believe in legislating from the bench,\u201d said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. \u201cMr. Chief Justice, if you want to be a legislator, resign and run for Congress. But at any rate, just resign!\u201d \u201cJohn Roberts didn\u2019t \u2018side with\u2019 the liberal wing of the Supreme Court, HE IS A LIBERAL,\u201d tweeted Fox News contributor Dan Bongino. Despite the attention to Roberts\u2019 recent left-leaning votes, however, the chief justice has on many occasions remained with conservatives in 5-4 decisions. According to statistics compiled by\u00a0SCOTUSBlog, the court\u2019s October 2018 term featured 17 cases that resulted in 5-4 decisions where all four liberal justices voted together. Of these, Roberts turned out to be a deciding vote in 10 of them, sticking with his fellow conservatives seven times and voting with liberal justices three times. On Tuesday, Roberts sided with conservatives, resulting in the\u00a05-4 decision in the\u00a0school choice case that said\u00a0a clause in Montana's state constitution forbidding aid to schools controlled by a \"church, sect, or denomination\" violated the U.S. Constitution's Free Exercise Clause because it prevented religious schools from participating in an aid program that would have provided tax credits for scholarships at private schools. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Supreme Court still has nearly a dozen cases left to decide this term, with several having significant political implications. Their issues include whether states can force members of the Electoral College to vote in accordance with the state's popular vote, and whether President Trump's tax returns can be released to House committees or Manhattan prosecutors.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Welcome to the Vivint Smart Home\u00a0Arena, the home of the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City. This is a special two-hour preview of tonight's vice presidential debate.Good evening, I'm Bret Baier.MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening everybody, I'm\u00a0Martha MacCallum.Breaking tonight, we are 26 days away from this presidential election.\u00a0Tonight, we're giving you a first look at some brand new Fox polls on the\u00a0election, the coronavirus, and the economy.BAIER: The big one, the head-to-head. Joe Biden up 10 points, doubling his\u00a0lead from last month.MACCALLUM: President Trump is shifting gears on yesterday's decision to\u00a0stop negotiations on a pre-election virus stimulus package and late this\u00a0afternoon, the director of National Intelligence said that he has provided\u00a0almost a thousand pages of documents to the U.S. attorney investigating the\u00a0origins of the Trump collusion probe.\u00a0We've got Fox team coverage for you Gillian Turner on the developments in\u00a0the Durham probe. Peter Doocy here in Salt Lake City looks at how tonight's\u00a0debate will be different from any other.BAIER: And we begin with chief White House correspondent John Roberts\u00a0starting us off with the latest on the president's health. Good evening,\u00a0John.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret,\u00a0Martha, good evening to you. We should point out that the president just\u00a0tweeted out a new video moments ago in which he called him contracting\u00a0coronavirus code \"A blessing from God\" a blessing in disguise because he\u00a0discovered this new Regeneron drug, a polyclonal antibody which the\u00a0president promised he will get approved quickly and make available free of\u00a0charge.Now, to tonight's debate, Vice President Mike Pence is needing to have a\u00a0big night tonight because a new Fox News poll out finds, more voters think\u00a0that Joe Biden won the first presidential debate last Tuesday than\u00a0President Trump. 44 percent of people saying, they thought Biden won it,\u00a0compared to 29 percent for President Trump. The president no doubt will be\u00a0watching tonight's debate as he got back to work for the first time in the\u00a0West Wing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)ROBERTS: The Marines stationed in front of the West Wing indicating\u00a0President Trump was back in the Oval Office today for the first time since\u00a0returning from Walter Reed. The president receiving a briefing on the\u00a0hurricane and coronavirus relief.\u00a0In a statement, the White House physician saying, the president has been\u00a0fever-free for more than four days, symptom-free for over 24 hours.\u00a0Dr. Sean Conley saying, President Trump now has detectable levels of\u00a0antibodies. Suggesting his immune system is responding to the infection\u00a0through Regeneron which makes the antibody cocktail he was given on Friday\u00a0said, the antibodies could be from their drug.MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: He's doing really well. We\u00a0actually spent some time together yesterday working very hard from the\u00a0residence and I can tell you that he's fully engaged and feeling great.ROBERTS: The White House response to coronavirus will be a major topic at\u00a0tonight's vice presidential debate. Mike Pence has been the president's\u00a0point person leading the Coronavirus Task Force.Our new Fox News poll finds, coronavirus tied with the economy is voter's\u00a0top issue. 68 percent of people who say coronavirus is their top issue\u00a0indicate they'll vote for Biden, compared to 29 percent for President\u00a0Trump.Tonight, Mike Pence expected to contrast how the White House responded in\u00a0the early days of the pandemic with what Democrats were saying.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer,\u00a0they all wanted to keep our borders open between China, the epicenter of a\u00a0viral outbreak. They couldn't help themselves but go to the P.C. response\u00a0of well, it's racist and xenophobic to literally shut down travel from the\u00a0epicenter of a deadly viral outbreak.ROBERTS: Terrorism and ISIS also expected to be a factor tonight. Among the\u00a0vice president's guests, the parents of Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian\u00a0worker who was captured, tortured, and killed by ISIS. Two men believed to\u00a0be involved in Mueller's death, the so-called ISIS Beatles we're today\u00a0brought to the United States to face justice.After pulling the plug on negotiations for a comprehensive coronavirus\u00a0relief bill, President Trump today urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to do\u00a0it in pieces, tweeting, if I am sent a standalone bill for stimulus checks\u00a0$1,200, they will go out to our great people immediately. I am ready to\u00a0sign right now. Are you listening, Nancy?\u00a0The House Speaker was in fact listening and said this.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He's just again rebounding from a terrible\u00a0mistake that he made yesterday and the Republicans in Congress were going\u00a0down the drain with him on that.(END VIDEOTAPE)ROBERTS: The president also suggesting today the money that was unspent\u00a0from the first coronavirus relief bill could be reallocated toward Paycheck\u00a0Protection, enhanced unemployment insurance benefits, even support for the\u00a0airlines but that that would take legislation to do Nancy Pelosi last month\u00a0was unwilling to even entertain the so-called skinny bill for coronavirus\u00a0relief. So, it's unclear whether or not she would support a proposal like\u00a0that.Again Bret, the big news out of this video that the president just tweeted,\u00a0calling his infection with coronavirus a blessing from God because he\u00a0discovered this new drug from Regeneron which he said made him feel good\u00a0almost instantaneously, Bret.BAIER: I will see that video momentarily here on Fox. John Roberts, live at\u00a0the North Lawn. John, thanks.MACCALLUM: So, stocks did rally today on the hopes of another COVID\u00a0stimulus bill. Dow picked up 531 points on the best days it had since July.\u00a0S&P was up 58, NASDAQ finished ahead by 210.BAIER: Heading into tonight's debate, Senator Harris has higher approval\u00a0numbers than Vice President Pence. Our new Fox poll has Harris at 53\u00a0percent favorable, 40 percent unfave. Pence's numbers 47, 48 respectively.MACCALLUM: So, this is going to be debate unlike any other from a physical\u00a0standpoint because of the coronavirus but that does not mean that the\u00a0stakes are not extremely high here. Correspondent Peter Doocy live in Salt\u00a0Lake City for us with a look ahead tonight. Hi, Peter.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Tonight's debate in Salt Lake\u00a0City will be contact-free.SYMONE SANDERS, BIDEN CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: We don't expect them to have\u00a0any interaction except for the words that they hear on the debate stage.DOOCY: Harris, the former prosecutor knows Democrats have sky-high\u00a0expectations for her showdown with Mike Pence. Telling donors last month,\u00a0let me just say something. He's a good debater. So, I'm so concerned, like\u00a0I can only disappoint.\u00a0Pence has had tonight circled on his calendar since August.MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Joe Biden and the\u00a0Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left. And look, we'll\u00a0talk about that. I'm looking forward to that debate more than I can tell\u00a0you.DOOCY: Democrats hope Harris hones in on Pence's record (INAUDIBLE)\u00a0responding to COVID-19.PELOSI: It should be about health care in terms of Mike Pence being the\u00a0head of the task force to -- on the coronavirus, really? What level of\u00a0success does he have to offer?DOOCY: Republicans plan to pin Harris as having a radical record.STEVE CORTES, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: She was to the left of\u00a0Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders. So you have a stark contrast\u00a0here, you have a wide chasm ideologically between these two folks.DOOCY: Significant steps have been taken to protect Pence and Harris from\u00a0COVID-19, but it's not clear if this set up will be enough to make Joe\u00a0Biden comfortable in the same room with Donald Trump next week.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I figured he still has COVID,\u00a0we shouldn't have a debate.DOOCY: He's been pledging to follow the advice of experts all week.BIDEN: And I'm going to continue to listen to the -- to the scientist. But\u00a0I'm looking to have an opportunity to do a town hall meeting if that\u00a0occurs.DOOCY: The Trump campaign's final scouting report on Kamala Harris is in,\u00a0straight from the stand-in who played her in mock debates with Pence.PAM BONDI, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISER: I know Kamala, she's smart, she's\u00a0articulate, she is very tough, she's a -- she's a great debater.\u00a0Prosecutor's debate, that's what she do every day in a courtroom.DOOCY: The Biden team has been studying tape too.KATE BEDINGFIELD, BIDEN DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: We know Mike Pence is a\u00a0very good debater. He's a very skilled debater and he gets a lot of credit\u00a0because he speaks in complete sentences, unlike Donald Trump.(END VIDEOTAPE)DOOCY: Masks are mandatory for everybody that's going to be in this room\u00a0except the debaters and the moderator.And tonight, the New York Times is quoting an epidemiologist talking about\u00a0the plexiglass on stage saying that it is \"Only going to be effective if\u00a0the Vice President or Kamala Harris are spitting at each other\" but it's\u00a0still there as the debate organizers borrow the kind of barrier that you\u00a0might see if you're checking out at the grocery store, Bret, Martha.MACCALLUM: Peter, thank you very much.BAIER: We have major developments tonight in the investigation into the\u00a0origins of the Trump-Russia collusion probe. The director of National\u00a0Intelligence is promising full cooperation and is backing that up tonight.\u00a0Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us how. Good evening, Gillian.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you both,\u00a0Bret and Martha. So, breaking tonight, the director of National\u00a0Intelligence, that's John Ratcliffe announcing his offices provided nearly\u00a0a thousand pages of documentation to the Department of Justice to help with\u00a0their ongoing investigation into the origins of the 2016 Russia probe.Now, Ratcliffe says all these documents were provided in response to John\u00a0Durham. He is the U.S. attorney that's leading the Trump administration's\u00a0counter probe.\u00a0And tonight, in a statement, Ratcliffe says, the O.D. and I look forward to\u00a0supporting the DOJ and further declassifications consistent with their\u00a0investigation.As you can see, tensions tonight between the Obama administration and Trump\u00a0administration intelligence communities is ratcheting up fast.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TURNER: Newly released documents from operation Crossfire Hurricane are\u00a0guiding a political firestorm in Washington. Former CIA Director John\u00a0Brennan is taking aim at Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe,\u00a0after he transmitted tranche of documents including Brennan's handwritten\u00a0notes to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: He -- it is appalling, his selective\u00a0declassification of information that clearly is designed to advance the\u00a0political interests of Donald Trump.\u00a0These were my notes from the 2016 period when I briefed President Obama and\u00a0the rest of the next security council team about what the Russians were up\u00a0to and I was giving examples of the type of access that the U.S.\u00a0intelligence community had to Russian information.TURNER: Former Intel chiefs then begin duking it out on Twitter. Former\u00a0Acting DNI Ric Grenell tweeting. Proof, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden\u00a0directed their administration to use the powers of government to attack\u00a0Donald Trump's campaign and then transition.Former CIA Director Michael Hayden replying, you're a quote expletive,\u00a0really.Grenell then responding, I see you don't like to be exposed and so you\u00a0resort to name-calling.President Trump tweeted he wants to see more. I have fully authorized the\u00a0total declassification of any and all documents pertaining to the single\u00a0greatest political crime in American history, the Russia-hoax. Likewise,\u00a0the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal.That authorization, in fact, came nearly a year and a half ago when he gave\u00a0the Attorney General permission to declassify any documents relating to\u00a0Crossfire Hurricane.(END VIDEOTAPE)TURNER: As this political drama unfolds, allies of President Trump over on\u00a0Capitol Hill who are themselves leading their own inquiry into the origins\u00a0of the Russia probe are ratcheting up pressure on the FBI Director\u00a0Christopher Wray and the CIA Director Gina Haspel, accusing them both of\u00a0blocking the release of more documentation in this probe, Bret and Martha.BAIER: Gillian, thank you. We will discuss that Twitter feud more with\u00a0former acting DNI Chief Richard Grenell in just a bit. But first, let's\u00a0bring in the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Thank you very much\u00a0for the time.We want to talk about that last story with you but first, about the\u00a0president. We're going to see this Twitter video in just a bit. He's\u00a0obviously projecting that he's doing well, you expect him to be out on the\u00a0trail soon?MEADOWS: Well, I do. He's actually has been in the Oval Office mostly\u00a0afternoon. That video was taped just a few hours ago on the South Lawn and\u00a0he's -- he keeps telling everyone but he's telling me privately, these\u00a0feels better than he did 20 years ago. And so, we're just very very\u00a0thankful to the doctors to the American people for their well wishes. And I\u00a0am for hopefully this groundbreaking drug that has made such a difference\u00a0in the president's recovery and so, he's put in a full day. He's still in\u00a0the Oval Office. I just left there to come out and be with you and your\u00a0viewers.MACCALLUM: So, Mark Meadows can you give us a sense of what a person has to\u00a0do to go into the Oval Office to speak with him? I understand that you were\u00a0in there today. There's a lot of blowback for him being back in the Oval\u00a0Office and around people since he still has the virus. So, did you wear\u00a0full PPE when you went in there?MEADOWS: I did, you may see some lines from my mask that I had on earlier.\u00a0We've got N95 mask, we've got goggles, we got full PPE.\u00a0And we're keeping the access there into the Oval very limited but it may be\u00a0limited in terms of direct contact with personnel and people that support\u00a0him but it's not limited in terms of the amount of phone calls and the\u00a0amount of work that he's getting done because he's been constantly on the\u00a0phone with Secretary Mnuchin, leader McConnell, leader McCarthy as it\u00a0relates to the stimulus and where we are and how we can best make sure that\u00a0the American people can get help.BAIER: You know, I want to ask you about the stimulus but first, you know,\u00a0there's a lot of talk about when he first contracted the virus. And there\u00a0are a lot of things we still don't know.We're listening to the physicians and all the statements they put out, but\u00a0we don't know when his last negative test was, will we?MEADOWS: Well, we don't normally get into the testing protocol for the\u00a0president. Obviously, the doctor has already spoken about that, that it was\u00a0a positive test on last Thursday evening when he was confirmed to have the\u00a0coronavirus. And obviously, the doctor here -- the White House doctor\u00a0kicked into gear with making sure that he was protected and had the medical\u00a0treatment there was proper.I can tell you that from our standpoint, I think the doctor put out today -- you know, that there were no antibodies with the amount of review that\u00a0was done that particular night which would indicate that we caught it very,\u00a0very early.And so, we're just very thankful that he is where he is at, and we're\u00a0looking forward to hopefully having not only a healthy president but a\u00a0healthy America.As we advance the prospects of some of these therapeutics that are coming\u00a0down the pike, I can tell you, two of them were put in for emergency use\u00a0authorization today. The president has been very clear. He wants to make\u00a0sure that those get approved as quickly and as safely as possible.But then, they are given free to everyone so that the American people can\u00a0have the same kind of treatment that he just received at Walter Reed.MACCALLUM: I know everybody wants to make sure that those treatments are\u00a0widely available, and I think there's a plan to get that underway. I just\u00a0want to go back around on this one more time, because it was put out today\u00a0that the gold star families that were at the event at the White House on\u00a0September 27, have been told that they may have been exposed to coronavirus\u00a0when they were there.So, that's why it's so important to know when his case was active, and the\u00a0places that he went during that time. And also, all the other people at the\u00a0White House who have since been -- since been seen as positive. So, can you\u00a0answer that?MEADOWS: You know -- you know, when you look at that, when you do contact\u00a0tracing, what you do is you go back, according to CDC, 48 hours prior to\u00a0either symptoms or a positive test. And we've done all of that. And that's\u00a0to try to make sure that we can mitigate the risk of anybody that has come\u00a0in contact with it. The good news about the actual incubation period is that we know that generally, that incubation period is about five to seven days. It can be longer, that's why we tell people to quarantine between 10 and 14 days. But part of that contact tracing, we've done all the contact tracing to go back to make sure that anybody that would -- was at risk has been contacted. And I met with the CDC and our own medical White House staff, actually, yesterday, to verify that not only has that been done but indeed making sure that it -- that it has been accomplished. BAIER: There's a lot of questions about the ending of the negotiations on the next stimulus on coronavirus. The president sending out that tweet before the markets closed. The Dow took a major drop. MEADOWS: Right. BAIER: Then, you had the House Speaker come out and say this about that decision. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI: I wouldn't go anywhere near the White House. It's one of the most dangerous places in the country. I said yesterday to my colleagues, I said, there are those who say that a steroids have an impact on people's thinking. I don't know, but there are those health care providers who say that. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Went on to say that may have been the steroids that made him end the negotiations. What's the truth behind ending those stimulus negotiations, and then, tweeting out that these singular deals are still possible? MEADOWS: Well, anybody who's negotiated with Nancy Pelosi more than a month will realize that cutting off a deal has nothing to do with steroids. It has more to do with the person that looks in the mirror when she gets up in the morning. And so, I can tell you that as we look at this, we believe that we have a number of things that we agree upon, a broad base of support to get a deal. But yet, she was continuing to stick at her 2.2 to 2.4, depending on how you calculate it, trillion-dollar deal. And when Secretary Mnuchin had not only offered 1.6 but was willing to go to 1.7 trillion, she'd rather have zero than that kind of number. Now, I can tell you that maybe, perhaps, the best way to do it is take all the things that we agree upon, start building those back, and passing those out. Leader McConnell, I know, is willing to look at, you know, a separate bill for airlines, and PPP. If we can -- we can look at some of those and start to add to it. But at the same time, if -- you know, if she thinks that she can come back with something that's closer to where Secretary Mnuchin has come up to, I'm sure the president is more than willing to look at, at a counter-proposal. But to date, she hasn't really been doing that. Over the last several weeks, she's been having a lot of conversations and it's been Secretary Mnuchin that's been giving, not Speaker Pelosi. MACCALLUM: Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, thank you as always. Good to have you here tonight, sir. MEADOWS: Great to be with you both. Thank you. BAIER: We just received that new Twitter video message from President Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hi, perhaps you recognize me, it's your favorite president. And I'm standing in front of the Oval Office at the White House, which is always an exciting place to be. I got back a day ago from Walter Reed Medical Center. I spent four days there and didn't have to. I could have stayed at the White House, but the doctors said, because you're president, let's do it. I said, fine. You tell me what to do and I'm going to listen. These are great professionals. They've done a fantastic job. And by the way, not only at Walter Reed, all over the country, we have the greatest doctors in the world, we have the greatest nurses, the greatest first responders, law enforcement, by the way, incredible, firefighters, everybody. They're just great. We have great people. This is a great country. But I spent four days there and I went in and I wasn't feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron. It's called, Regeneron, and other things too, but I think this was the key. But they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now. So, I just want to say, we have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they're coming out and we're trying to get them on an emergency basis. We've authorized it. I've authorized it. And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, I think we're going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free. And especially, if you're a senior, we're going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready. I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you're going to get better. You're going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. The job that the scientists, the labs, everybody has done is incredible. Then, addition to that, you have various other drugs that help a lot. But these -- I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me, it wasn't therapeutic, it just made me better. I call that a cure. So, I want to get these things done. So, we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly. That's much more important to me than the vaccine. But, on the vaccines, we have many companies that are in final stages for the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, all great companies, but many of them. And we're going to have a great vaccine very, very shortly. I think we should have it before the election. But frankly, the politics gets involved and that's OK. They want to play their games; it's going to be right after the election. But we did it. Nobody else -- nobody else would have been able to do it. The FDA has acted as quickly as they've ever acted in history. There's never been a time and no president has ever pushed him like I pushed them either, to be honest with you. But the FDA is approving things in a matter of weeks that used to take a matter of years. So, we have these drugs, Eli Lilly, and the others that are so good. But they are, in my opinion, remember this, they're going to say that they're therapeutic. And I guess they are therapeutic. Some people don't know how to define therapeutic. I view it different. It's a cure for me, I walked in, I didn't feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I want to get out of the hospital. And that's what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great. I feel like perfect. So, I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it, I heard about this drug. I said, Let me take it. It was my suggestion. I said, let me take it, and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. And I think, if I didn't catch it, we'd be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job. I want to get for you what I got, and I'm going to make it free. You're not going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault, and China is going to pay a big price, what they've done to this country. China is going to pay a big price, what they've done to the world. This was China's fault and just remember that. So, we're going to get you the drug. It's going to be free. We're going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you'll see some amazing things happen because we have -- our military is doing the distribution. It's called logistics, and they deliver, hundreds of thousands of troops in a matter of days. This is easy stuff for them. Our generals are all ready, we're waiting for the emergency use authorization, and the drug companies have just made a lot of it. So, hopefully, this is going to be not just a therapeutic, it's going to be much more than a therapeutic. You're going to get better; you're going to get better fast just like I did. So, again, a blessing in disguise. Good luck. (END VIDEOTAPE) BAIER: President Trump, and -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: So, looks like he's feeling quite well and is back, right? BAIER: Outside the Rose Garden there on the South Lawn, saying that he wants to get Regeneron, this -- not approved by the FDA yet, but on its way -- available for everyone who has COVID. And saying, he feels obviously like a million bucks. MACCALLUM: So, that drug is the monoclonal antibody drug which is a synthetic version of the antibody that you get if you have coronavirus, and then, your body responds to it and builds that antibody. He says he requested it from the doctors. As you say, even though it wasn't approved by the FDA, they want to make it free for everybody. He also says that China will pay a big price for what has happened with the coronavirus in this country. BAIER: So, expect that -- the focus on that, this tape, what he said, to come in tonight to the debate. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Absolutely. BAIER: Obviously, Senator Harris wants to focus on COVID-19. Vice President Pence, being the head of that task force is going to talk about what they have done, what they're doing, but we'll probably put the focus elsewhere as well. MACCALLUM: Yes. He says the military is preparing to distribute this. And that, as I said, everybody in the country who needed it, would get it for free. So, that's sort of his pitch before the big debate tonight, putting himself out there on all of that. So, coming up next, we're going to speak with the former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, about these thousand documents that have been released from the DNI. BAIER: A little bit later, we'll talk to Senator Chris Coons. But first, we'll set the stage and look a little different side than the first presidential debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Here in the debate hall for the vice presidential debate, they're getting ready, you can see the difference. The plexiglass in between the candidates and these three desks. Vice President Pence will be stage left, Senator Harris on stage right, and then, Susan Page, the moderator in the middle. There are additional precautions in this hall. Obviously, the tests, the masks. Over my shoulder here, the photographer is surrounded by plexiglass, that's new. So, they're being extra careful with COVID-19 ahead of this big debate Wednesday night. Our show continues after this. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0 All right, we are back in Salt Lake City, and we want to bring in the former U.S. Ambassador to Germany and the former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. Ric, good to have you with us tonight. The news this evening is about these 1,000 documents that John Ratcliffe, the Director of National Intelligence now, has released to the Durham investigation. And it's getting a ton of attention. John Brennan is pushing back in saying that the quotes that were released from him about this effort to get Hillary's campaign to loop the Trump campaign into this Russian conspiracy theory, John Brennan says there is nothing to that. They were just letting the president know what they were picking up on Russian intel. What do you say do all that? RIC GRENELL, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:\u00a0 Well, if John Brennan is so certain, why doesn't he come down on the side of transparency? Look, we've had a lot of people, Susan Rice, James Comey, Brennan, a whole bunch of people scrambling, doing everything they can to not have transparency. Transparency isn't political, Martha. Transparency is supposed to be our friend. I will give you that it is very unique to have transparency in Washington, though. Washington types want to hold the information. That is what they have done. What John Brennan needs to understand is that the information from career intelligence officials from the very beginning was pushed aside and classified away because it didn't fit the narrative that the Obama administration, the Obama/Biden administration, Susan Rice, James Comey, and Brennan, all of them, what they wanted to spoon-feed to the American people. This is just the facts. Anyone who wants to disagree with this should come down on the side of transparency and say let's look at all of the documents, see how this started, see what kind of individuals were briefed, what kind of career intelligence official statements we were dealing with that were pushed aside. Let's have a full, transparent look at the situation. I think that after so many years of hearing Washington politicians and the insiders spoon-feed the American people miss information, we need to go back to the beginning and be transparent. What are you afraid of? BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0 Speaking of transparency, you were acting DNI, you released some documents. This DNI is doing the same, following the president's orders to declassify documents. But Ric, there is a lot of frustration, not just Democrats who are blowing this off and saying it's 28 days before an election, but also Republicans up on the Hill who said the FBI and CIA have been slow walking things. They don't know where the Durham report is. And again, you're 28 days from the election. There is a lot of frustration here. GRENELL:\u00a0 I take the point, but let's remove the 28 days, because the most important part of this is not the election. The most important part is making sure that our government, our U.S. government, the greatest country in the whole world, does not weaponize the power that they have, individuals weaponize it against their political enemies. I have spent 11 years at the State Department. When these types of things happen, we condemn them. We call out opposition parties in other countries who try to do things like this. This was not a peaceful transition of power. They went after candidate Trump. They went after newly elected Donald Trump, the president-elect, his entire team. It's pretty clear. I go back to the fact that there is a lot of foot dragging from Washington, D.C., types. It's not a Republican versus Democrat issue. This is a Washington versus the rest of America issue. We have got to clean up Washington. I think what you saw from President Trump just now on the COVID issue is the classic President Trump that we hired. Here is somebody who doesn't talk about filing some sort of piece of legislation or cosponsoring a bill, which is what Joe Biden talks about what he did when asked about his accomplishments. This is President Trump saying, you know what, I experienced this drug. It was amazing. I'm going to get it through the FDA and I'm going to make sure everybody gets it for free who has COVID. That's an amazing outsider perspective. He is a man of action. He is not a man of cosigning pieces of legislation. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 There's obviously a big war of words going on between prior heads of the CIA and the DNI. And here is Michael Hayden, the former CIA director, talking about transparency and trust and truth, which you just talked about, but here's his version. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR:\u00a0 Truth is really important, but especially intelligence. President Trump doesn't care about facts. President Trump doesn't care about the truth. He doesn't listen to his experts. If Trump gets another turn, I think many alliances will be gone, and America will be alone. And that's a real, real problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 He came after you and called you pretty nasty name, Ric. What do you have to say to the former CIA director? GRENELL:\u00a0 Look, I'm not going to get into the name calling. I think that's silly. We're the greatest country in the world, and we can have policy disagreements, but let's talk about actual facts and policy discussions. Here is a man who attacked me with really shameless words, all because I was trying to be transparent to share information. So he can talk about facts, and he can talk about wanting to see facts, but his whole tirade against me was because I was calling for more transparency. So again, I go back to the fact, this is the Washington game of pretending that you know something on public television, and then when you go into the bowels of the House where you're under oath in front of lawyers, you say something completely different, which is what Susan Rice and Samantha Power and the whole team did. So I think we can settle this. Practical people outside of Washington, they just view this as all Washington talk. And what they would say is, let's just see the transcripts. Let's go back to the facts and look at it. The American people are smart enough to know when they see something, they can come to their own conclusion. But that is just not the way Washington works. They like to spoon-feed the American people. BAIER:\u00a0 We've heard from the Trump campaign, a lot of pushback on polls. The polls that have come out since the first debate, Ric, have seen Joe Biden increasing his lead not just nationally but also in some of these key battleground states. Considering that, understanding the skepticism from the Trump campaign about polls, what does Vice President Pence have to do tonight, quickly if you could? GRENELL:\u00a0 Look, I think Vice President Pence just has to talk about the facts. Kamala Harris is one of the most radical senators that we have ever seen come around. She is the queen of the cancel culture. She has said that she compared immigration officials, ICE officials, to the KKK. This is somebody who is a real radical. And what Vice President Pence just needs to do is just ask her a question and demand an answer, and the American people will see just how radical she is. BAIER:\u00a0 Ric Grenell, we appreciate your time outside the debate hall. Thank you. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Thanks, Ric. So here are some of other headlines tonight. Wisconsin health officials are opening a field hospital at the state fairgrounds near Milwaukee as the surge in COVID-19 cases threatens to overwhelm hospitals there. A new FOX News poll finds 73 percent of those surveyed believe that the coronavirus is only somewhat or not at all under control. BAIER:\u00a0 Hurricane Delta has made landfall south of Cancun along the northeastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. It is expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico and grow considerably stronger. Residents along the coast are preparing for the hurricane to hit the area Friday. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 And the Justice Department has unsealed charged against two Islamic State militants from Britain, accusing them of carrying out a gruesome campaign of torture, beheadings, and other acts of violence against western hostages they had captured in Syria, including four Americans. BAIER:\u00a0 Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin released from prison after posting a $1 million bond. Chauvin had been jailed in segregation at the state's maximum security prison awaiting next spring's trial in the death of George Floyd. He is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 And the South Carolina Senate appears to be tightening. The Cook Political Report is now rating this race a toss-up. Incumbent Lindsey Graham had at one point been considered a heavy favorite against challenger Jaime Harrison. BAIER:\u00a0 These Senate races are interesting to watch. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Very. BAIER:\u00a0 Our latest FOX News poll shows likely voters who say they will mail in their ballots break significantly for the Democratic ticket. Our survey finds 68 to 27 a lead for Biden-Harris ticket among those voters. In person voters go for the Trump-Pence ticket by a nine-point spread. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 With just four weeks to go until Election Day, some states have issues with ballots and the voting process. Senior correspondent Eric Shawn joins us tonight from New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 People are not only voting now for president, more than 5 million ballots reported so far. But in some places, they are already counting their votes. In Maryland, the numbers are being tallied up, but like other states, cannot be released until after the polls close on Election Day. Some states are going to court to move up the counting process. Election officials say that would give him a jump start to get the election results sooner. At least 17 states now start counting at some point before November 3rd. But some other states, like the key battleground Pennsylvania, want to get a head start too. KATHY BOOCKVAR, (D) PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH:\u00a0 We need the legislature to pass a law that allows counties to start pre-canvassing the mail in absentee ballots sooner. That's our main need from the legislature right now. SHAWN:\u00a0 In New Jersey, where this year's election is taking place predominantly by mail, a federal judge found in favor of the state to start counting 10 days before Election Day, handing the Trump campaign a defeat in court. This comes as a garden state mail carrier has been arrested for allegedly discarding mail in dumpsters, including 99 general election ballots being mailed to the voters in West Orange, New Jersey. Officials say the nearly 2,000 piece of mail were recovered and put back into the system. Ohio started mailing 2 million absentee ballots, double the 2016 number. In Franklin County, some voters received absentee ballots meant for others in different towns. Officials blame the mix up on a high speed scanner. (END VIDEOTAPE) SHAWN:\u00a0 And as for that New Jersey mail carrier, well, he happens to be the second one accused of wrongdoing after a West Virginia mailman pled guilty to mail and election fraud in July. He allegedly altered eight absentee ballots by changing party registration from Democrat to Republican on some, though tonight there is no apparent evidence that the New Jersey mailman's case is directly connected at all to the election. Bret and Martha, back to you. BAIER:\u00a0 Eric, thank you. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So let's hear from one of the members of the Joe Biden team, Senator Chris Coons in Delaware. Senator, good to have you with us this evening. Thanks for being here. What are you looking for tonight -- SEN. CHRISTOPHER COONS, (D-DE), SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:\u00a0 Great to be on with you, Martha. Thank you. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 It's great to have you with us as always. Thank you, Senator. So the last debate was pretty raucous. What do you expect tonight? COONS:\u00a0 Well, I expect that it will be a little more orderly. I was in Cleveland, and I've never seen anything like that. Frankly, tonight I think that we'll see Vice President Pence, who, by the way, spent five years as a radio and television commentator, as a talk show host, delivering a more measured defense of the Trump administration record. And we'll see my colleague, Senator Kamala Harris of California, explaining and advocating how a Biden/Harris administration will have a plan to bring our country together to get us through this pandemic and to build back better on our economy. I do think Vice President Pence, who is the chair of the Coronavirus Task Force, will have a hard time answering questions about how successful that task force has been when the president and first lady and 18 members of the senior team in the White House have recently, sadly, been infected. BAIER:\u00a0 Senator, thank you for being here. I want to talk more about what you think about tonight and the back and forth, but I understand you met with Judge Amy Coney Barrett today. Tell us about that and where you are on that process. Our new polling suggests that people OK in the polls to say go ahead and confirm her. COONS:\u00a0 Bret, we didn't meet in person. We spoke by phone, which is just another reminder of how the pandemic has upended so much. We are just now 27 days from a presidential election where more than half the states are already voting. There is no precedent for the Senate considering a nominee for the Supreme Court this close to an election where voting has already started. I talked with Judge Barrett about some of her writings, some of her opinions, some law review articles, and I asked her questions about judicial philosophy, about how being a former clerk and a follower of Justice Scalia's view of textualism and originalism, how that would actually impact real Americans live. I spoke earlier today a Delawarean, Carrie (ph) from Middletown, who owns a small business, and she and her daughter have preexisting conditions. She is anxious about the future of the Affordable Care Act. As you know that's on the docket for the Supreme Court a week after the election. And I asked Judge Barrett whether she stood by previous comments she has made criticizing Chief Justice Roberts for upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. If the court strikes down the ACA, that will take away protections from half of all Americans, and that is something that Judge Barrett wouldn't speak to specifically, but I really do think is on the docket and on the ballot. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So was they anything that set off alarm bells for you? You when I have discussed the ACA before and have different this case is that's before the court now then the one was that was an overall look at it with Justice Roberts. But in terms of the other things that you said were alarming, what were those? COONS:\u00a0 Judge Barrett wouldn't make any specific comments about severability and how she would apply that in this case, but what I was also pressing her on was her view of precedent, whether or not the court should overturn long settled cases that we have come to rely on, that are critical in areas like voting rights or labor rights or reproductive rights or LGBQT rights. She wouldn't make any specific commitments, but I did press her view, repeatedly stating, that we should be willing to overturn long settled cases. So look, bluntly, my question -- BAIER:\u00a0 Senator, you know that -- you know that judges don't answer these questions in this kind of preconfirmation hearing back and forth. They just don't. One of the things, the questions -- don't mean to interrupt you here, but one of the questions that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris haven't answered is whether they would increase the number of Supreme Court justices on the court, or whether they would be for killing the filibuster. Why don't the candidates who are running as opposed to Judge Barrett answer those important questions about changes to our government? COONS:\u00a0 Well, Bret, the questions I did ask of Judge Barrett that are appropriate are about her judicial philosophy, whether she is someone who believes in a living Constitution or in originalism, and what that would mean for the real lives of daily middle America in terms of things like health care. But the questions you raise are ones where, if you heard former vice president Biden's remarks in Gettysburg yesterday, where he talked about bringing the country together, about trying to restore bipartisanship, it seems clear to me that what Joe Biden, given his record, given his platform, and given his view of our country, what he would prefer to do if possible is what I hope to do in the Senate if reelected and if we are in the majority. And that's to work across the aisle to deliver real solutions to the problems in front of us. If our democracy works, we won't need to take more extreme measures and change the rules of the Senate. But if we're not able to get partners who will work with us to solve issues right in front of us, like prescription drug prices or the opioid crisis, like getting out of this pandemic or building back better after this recession that's, frankly, largely been caused by President Trump's mishandling of this pandemic, if we don't have good partners for this, then there may be other changes on the horizon. But that's not something we need to consider yet. My hope is we'll be able to work together in the interests of bringing this country together after this election. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Senator, thank you. Those hearings for Amy Coney Barrett began on October the 12th, and we will check back in with you then. Thank you very much, Senator. BAIER:\u00a0 Thanks, Senator. Up next, the panel previews tonight's debate. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 But first, a closer look at the Utah State Capitol Building right here in Salt Lake City. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 We are here in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah, right in front of the state's capital as we get ready for a very big night tonight, the vice presidential debate between Senator Harris and Vice President Pence as Democracy 2020 rolls on. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATE BEDINGFIELD, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We have every expectation that Mike Pence is going to be compelling on the debate stage tonight, but Senator Harris is going to make the case for a different vision for this country, a different direction, and for competent, competent, capable leadership. MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP-PENCE CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence is ready. He is prepared to prosecute the case against the California radical extremist of Kamala Harris. And we know that he is going to talk about and ask the tough questions on Kamala. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 The prebattle for the vice presidential debate tonight. In the meantime, we just heard from the Democratic nominee Joe Biden in response to President Trump's statement in the Rose Garden that he thinks it's a gift that God gave him that he got COVID so that he can help others. Here is Joe Biden just moments ago responding. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 It's coming. BAIER:\u00a0 We think so. (LAUGHTER) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 It's coming. BAIER:\u00a0 OK, it's coming. It's not there yet. Let's bring in our panel -- we'll get it for you momentarily -- Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics, pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co- founder and president. Let's see. There was a little delay. Now the gremlins are allowing us to play this soundbite. Here we go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 I've got to think before I speak on this one. I think it's a tragedy that the president deals with COVID like it is something not to worry about when already 210,000 people have died. I think it's a travesty. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 He starts off by saying I need to think before I speak on this one, and you can hear the rest. Maybe they didn't want us to hear it because it didn't sound great, but we finally played it. Mo, your thoughts on this and what the president said earlier. MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:\u00a0 Look, this is the issue. COVID is the issue in this campaign. It is the number one issue on the minds of the voters. The president had an opportunity to turn around his sliding numbers on it, and he didn't seize the opportunity. To come out and say it was a gift because it would help him help people, but at the same time be there saying don't worry about it, don't be afraid of it, downplaying the virus and exposing people around him while he is still potentially contagious, the two just don't match. And that, to me, the president's numbers have not moved. He dramatically needs to change the dynamics of this race if he's going to turn the race around. The clock is ticking. And he's not doing anything to help his case right now. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Kristen, do you agree with the president's approach to his hospitalization and being diagnosed with COVID? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, POLLSTER:\u00a0 The president has had poor numbers on COVID-19 handling in polls going back months. Voters initially gave him the benefit of the doubt but were let down by his handling of this virus, and that has led to him having really tough standing in the polls as the narrative has shifted back from being able to talk about the economy to being really focused on COVID. This virus does not care what your campaign strategy is. It does not care what your messaging strategy is. You can't just turn the page and pretend like the virus has gone away, that it's no big deal, when it is something that is still dramatically disrupting Americans' lives. This was a moment where President Trump could have said, look, I have now seen this face to face. It has come to my front door, and said, here is what I'm going to do besides just wait for a vaccine to help us get through that. But we haven't heard that from the president, and that is why I think this is a missed opportunity for him. BAIER:\u00a0 Tom, sorry, but quickly, what are your thoughts? (LAUGHTER) TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER:\u00a0 I'll just say for the debate, Mike Pence has to be sharp tonight. He's got to do three things. He's got to defend the Trump administration's record, right, and he has got to press Kamala Harris, and he's got to do it by being aggressive yet respectful. BAIER:\u00a0 You were aggressive, yet respectful, and we made the commercial. Thank you. Sorry for the short talk there. When we come back, hour two of our special debate preview.

            "article_content": "What it means for the Court and the presidential election. The Republican National Committee launched a $10 million campaign to promote President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett to \u201chold Democrats accountable\u201d for what the GOP called their \u201chypocrisy\u201d on the nomination process to the high court. The initiative, rolled out after the president formally nominated Coney Barrett\u00a0to the high court on Saturday from the White House Rose Garden, includes a $10 million digital ad campaign, a new website and a get-out-the-vote effort in target states. AMY CONEY BARRETT ACCEPTS SUPREME COURT NOMINATION, PLEDGES TO 'FAITHFULLY AND IMPARTIALLY' DISCHARGE DUTIES The RNC said Saturday that the initiative also includes a \u201cmassive rapid response operation\u201d to amplify Coney Barrett\u2019s record, while \u201charnessing voters\u2019 enthusiasm about appointing a constitutionalist\u201d to the Supreme Court, and \u201cmotivate and persuade\u201d voters to the polls on Election Day. \u201cEven before President Trump announced a nominee, Democrats made clear that they would obstruct this Constitutional process every step of the way, throwing historical precedent out the window,\u201d RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Saturday. \u201cWith a full-throttled effort from now until President Trump\u2019s nominee is confirmed, our teams will expose Democrats\u2019 partisanship, aggressively promote the qualifications of Judge Barrett, and use this issue to galvanize voters to the polls in November.\u201d In addition to digital ads, the RNC is using its joint field effort with the Trump campaign, Trump Victory, to hold dozens of events and protests to engage with volunteers in critical states throughout the confirmation process. The effort comes ahead of what is expected to be a brutal Senate confirmation process for the president\u2019s nominee, as Democrats, including his Democratic opponent former Vice President Joe Biden has urged the Senate to block a nominee from being confirmed to the high court until after Election Day. \u201cSupreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions,\u201d Biden tweeted Saturday, just after President Trump nominated Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy left by late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cThe Senate shouldn\u2019t act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cAmericans deserve to be heard.\u201d Biden, this week, called Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s efforts to push a nominee through the Senate before Election Day an \u201cexercise in raw political power.\u201d Biden pointed to the controversy surrounding\u00a0Obama\u2019s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, and argued that \u201chaving made this their standard when it served their interest, they cannot, just four years later, change course when it doesn\u2019t serve their ends.\u201d Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or a vote on Garland\u2019s nomination,\u00a0citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump\u2019s choice to nominate Barrett would \u201charm millions of Americans.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s hand-picked successor to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat makes it clear: they intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act & overturn Roe,\u201d Harris tweeted, referring to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. \u201cThis selection would move the court further right for a generation & harm millions of Americans,\u201d she said.

Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris\u00a0is coming under increased scrutiny as the Supreme Court showdown\u00a0comes to a tipping point ahead of November's election. Following the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week, Democrats and Republicans have been locked in a constant struggle over the vacant seat on the high court. HARRIS MAKES MISLEADING STATEMENT ON COVID-19 BUSINESS LOANS WHILE CAMPAIGNING IN MICHIGAN While President Trump and the GOP are already pushing to get their potential pick through -- with the president promising a selection by Saturday -- Democrats argue that they should follow the precedent that\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had set ahead of the 2016 election. But, Republican lawmakers like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said\u00a0the contentious confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh broke that precedent two years ago. Kavanaugh was under intense pressure from Democratic members of Congress -- like then-Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris -- after he was accused of sexual assault by California psychology\u00a0professor Christine Blasey Ford and several other women. At the time, Harris made waves asking what many deemed \"gotcha\" questions about former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of the Trump\u00a0campaign, suggesting Kavanaugh had compromising conversations about the probe. Kavanaugh denied those allegations. Only two days after Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations were made public, Harris was one of the first to say: \"I believe her.\u201d FLASHBACK: KAMALA HARRIS SAID NATIONWIDE PROTESTS ARE 'NOT GOING TO STOP' As NPR reported Friday, it was notable, then, that Harris declined to answer reporters' questions about whether she plans to take part in the\u00a0impending confirmation hearing, though a\u00a0Biden-Harris\u00a0campaign official later admitted\u00a0she does plan to participate in the eventual hearing. But, as The Washington Times reported, Democrats hope the former state attorney general \"has the goods\" this time around to cross-examine like never before. While Harris is the most junior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, she won't be viewed in only that way within the confines of the hearing room walls, now being the Democrats' vice presidential nominee. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., listens to Christine Blasey Ford testify during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court in Washington. (Tom Williams/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press) \u201cHer voice in these hearings or in the campaign, focusing the American people on what is at stake -- what is on the ballot -- health care, reproductive rights, labor rights, LGBTQ rights, I think she will be very compelling,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told the Times. In the hearings, Harris will also serve as a representative for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and the coverage will likely drive the last few weeks before Election Day. DEMOCRATS TO UNVEIL BILL LIMITING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TERMS Biden has previously decried\u00a0Republicans' decision to push ahead with a vote, but much of his argument to voters that may have voted for President Trump in 2016 is based on a return to normalcy and decency in politics. It's unclear how Harris' approach could affect that message, as more states enter early voting periods. The president currently has a shortlist of five women he's reportedly considering for the seat, including\u00a0Judge Amy Coney Barrett,\u00a0Judge Barbara Lagoa,\u00a0Judge Joan Larsen,\u00a0Judge Allison Jones Rushing\u00a0and\u00a0deputy counsel to the president Kate Todd. AMY CONEY BARRETT'S FRIENDS, FAMILY PRAISE HER AS 'FAIR,' A 'POWERHOUSE' MARK MEADOWS SAYS THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS LOOKING FOR IN A SUPREME COURT PICK McConnell has the votes to advance whoever makes the cut this weekend and has warned that Democrats will give the nominee \"the same insane treatment.\" The Trump campaign, however, says it is not ruffled by the prospect of Harris and her \"law-and-order\" tactics. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The team's deputy\u00a0national press secretary,\u00a0Samantha Zager, told the Times that Harris is likely to abuse her power. \u201cWith Justice Kavanaugh, Harris showed the American people she clearly has a problem with pro-life principles and religious freedom, and we\u2019re sure she\u2019ll abuse her position to baselessly attack whoever the president nominates,\u201d she stated.",

A new study has found that a woman\u2019s eggs are especially selective when choosing the most ideal sperm for fertilization. Looking at leftover samples from 16 couples getting reproductive treatment, researchers from Sweden found that eggs release a chemical that attracts only certain types of sperm \u2014 regardless of whether they come from the woman\u2019s chosen partner, according to the findings published Tuesday in the\u00a0journal Proceedings of the Royal Society. COUPLES SHOULD WEAR FACE MASKS DURING SEX, NEW STUDY INSISTS The selectiveness could be a way of sorting out the mate with the best genes, said study author John Fitzpatrick, an assistant professor in the department of zoology at Stockholm University in Sweden. \u201cWe expected to see some sort of partner effect, but in half of the cases the eggs were attracting more sperm from a random male,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN. \u201cThe most likely explanation for this is that these chemical signals allow females to choose males who are more genetically compatible.\u201d A new study has found that a woman\u2019s eggs are especially selective when choosing the most ideal sperm for fertilization. (iStock) The researchers knew that eggs release chemicals during ovulation known as chemoattractants, which Fitzpatrick says act like a \u201cbreadcrumb trail\u201d for sperm to track down the egg. In this study, they found that as little as 18 percent\u00a0of sperm can even find the trail. When they do pick up on the signal, the sperm swim more vigorously toward the egg, increasing the chances of fertilization. Fitzpatrick and his colleagues believe this could potentially weed out less desirable sperm with fewer genetic variants, which would make the baby less immune to diseases. Attracting sperm with more diverse genes than the egg has could ultimately arm the baby with a better immune system. CORONAVIRUS SURVIVORS SHOULD WAIT 30 DAYS BEFORE HAVING SEX AGAIN, OFFICIAL IN THIS COUNTRY SAYS This wouldn\u2019t be the first time biology has taken the wheel, for better or for worse. Studies have found that\u00a0women have evolved to prefer men with beards\u00a0\u2014 even though beards potentially evolved to\u00a0protect fellas from punches to the head. In that case, it\u2019s probably for the best that eggs make the final call. This article originally appeared in the New York Post.",

TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to the special edition of \"Hannity\": Countdown to the Election. I'm Trey Gowdy, in tonight for Sean. We begin with a FOX News alert: the first charges in the Durham probe have been filed and it is the FBI under indictment. We will have much more just ahead, including exclusive reaction from Senator Lindsey Graham. But first, with just 81 days until the most consequential election of our lifetime, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are pandering to the far left, seizing the most out of touch ideas the extreme left has to offer and hope progressives will forget about Bernie and AOC and turn out for them in November. Keep in mind, Kamala Harris was firmly rejected by Democratic primary voters when she wanted to be the president and Joe Biden was never the first or second or third choice of progressives. It's why you see Kamala Harris flip-flopping on such major issues like health care, but even though Joe Biden himself. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESUMPTIVE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: On the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive health care, and including women who were the victims of rape and incest, do you now say you have a bald and regret that? You have only since you've been running president this time -- I believe him and I respect them being able to tell their stories and I'm encouraged to do it. REPORTER: Do you believe that the vice president should enter this race? HARRIS: He's going to have to make that decision for himself, I wouldn't tell him what to do. The issue of lynching is part of the stain on America's history. REPORTER: He apologized this morning on Twitter, saying, I should not have used those words. Do you accept that apology? HARRIS: I think that's right for him to apologize, yes. You also worked with them to oppose busing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOWDY: What does all of this mean? It means Kamala Harris most firmly held conviction is her own personal ambition. Six months ago, Harris was traveling the country telling voters she would make a much better president than Joe Biden, touting her liberal record in the Senate and questioning Biden's comments on race and even expressing belief in the women who accused him of impropriety. The media won't tell you that and the media won't make Harris and Biden answer questions because Biden and Harris are making it clear -- they are not planning on meeting with voters and they're not interested in taking any questions from their adoring fans in the press. For the second day in a row, Biden and Harris talked but would not take questions -- take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (REPORTER ASKING QUESTION) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, guys. Come on, guys. Thank you. Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And you can see that there was one question from reporters. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOWDY: And while the Democratic establishment wants you to believe there is unity ahead of the virtual DNC, the infighting is already begun. For example, progressives are now blasting the party for only giving Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez a mere minute, 60 seconds to speak of the convention next week, but they are giving more time to John Kasich and Michael Bloomberg. And according to new reports, tensions are even lingering between the Obama and Biden camps. Joining me now for reaction, former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, along with FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce, and American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp. Welcome to each of you. Reince, let me start with you. How did Kamala Harris go from underperforming and the race for president to being the most exciting choice for vice president, how does that happen politically? (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I'm sorry, Tammy. Go ahead. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, no, you're there, go forth, Reince. All yours. PRIEBUS: All right. I was just going to say, you know, they are running a race where they are going to do everything they can to not talk about what they believe. They're not answering questions. They're not being seen. Biden is hidden in the basement because they are only running on one thing, which is anti-Trump. And Kamala Harris will be defined, she needs to be defined and the reason is that 60 percent of Americans actually don't think that Joe Biden will finish his first term. So, everything you said is true, Congressman, whether it's a Green New Deal, socialized medicine, D.C. statehood, liberal courts, but the most disturbing position that Kamala Harris has taken, is the fact that she wants to expand the Supreme Court, add liberal justices to accomplish the things that you just talked about. And probably the most underappreciated Trump accomplishment is his work on the judiciary, more judges than both of his predecessors combined at this point, two Supreme Court justices and Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are going to undo all of it. GOWDY: Tammy, let me bring you in. AOC may be the most charismatic and best public speaker the Democrats have. Why is she being limited to 60 seconds -- she would get more time if she came on with Sean than the Democrats are giving at her convention. Why just 60 seconds for her? BRUCE: You know, maybe that's what she should do, maybe she should come under this program and actually be able to talk to people. But it's not just 60 seconds, it's taped. They don't even trust her to go live. This is like leaving a nickel for a tip, which is worse than leaving no tip at all. She should be absolutely enraged, it's a statement. And when you're giving a Republican, Kasich, and a someone like Buttigieg big time, it's also a message they are trying to gaslight the base itself. In one hand, they are placating the far left when it comes to who they are hanging out with and who they're, you know, giving -- who they're pandering to internally, and then to the American people, they are trying to show this kind of milquetoast-y non-position kind of placement, they are placing the DNC as a whole in the basement with Joe where it really means nothing and it will collapse the moment it is looked at seriously or if there are questions that are asked. So, they're played it very, very carefully. If you want to run the United States, if you want to take this country back to the past, you better have the courage to stand up and explain to the American people exactly why they should do that. Instead, they continue to lie and they have to do this because they cannot compete with Donald Trump. Whether you like the president or not, the accomplishments over the last three and a half years have been extraordinary, we are only surviving now this pandemic from China because of the president's ability to keep the nation on her feet and make her strong. They can't compete with that. They have to come up with stunts about masks for everybody, you know, around the country, forever, until right November 4th. This is their problem. I think they're going to have Billy Eilish singing. But, you know, Billy Eilish is a great singer but she's not going to be president and neither is Joe Biden, and neither is Ms. Harris either. GOWDY: Matt, my math may be off but I think you and I got the same number of delegates for president that Kamala Harris got. So, if you're not exciting 12 months ago, what makes you exciting now? How is the media talking about her excitement when her campaign was such a dud? MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIRMAN: Well, the Democratic Party, this new socialist Democratic Party selects people on the boxes they can check and she does check a lot of boxes that are important to them, including the fact that she's a woman of color, that she's from California -- but you're right. What Republicans believe in is a market, Trey. She failed miserably in the markets. The only thing she actually did well was eviscerate and shred Joe Biden on the questions of race, the question of busing, his treatment of women in many of his past positions, including a position that is so radical to the Democrats, the idea that priests and nuns and people of faith shouldn't pay for other people's abortions. This question about how Kamala Harris has treated Catholic nominees picked by Donald Trump to be on the nation's highest court, Reince talked about the federal judiciary, what Kamala Harris did to people of faith, Christians and Catholics -- Catholics -- Catholic men who have the gall to join the Knights of Columbus which is a fraternal organization for Catholic men to make sure they are good husbands and good fathers into charitable work, she calls it basically a hate group. Any person that would stand up against a decent charitable organization like the Knights of Columbus should not be qualified to serve for national office. Joe Biden didn't just fail to call out Kamala Harris, he's now picked her to be on his team. This anti-Catholic bigotry is disgraceful and I think it's one of the reasons why Kamala Harris just is not likable to Republicans, to Democrats -- I think the more we see of her, the more people aren't going to like her. GOWDY: We shall see in 81 days. Reince Priebus, Tammy Bruce, Matt Schlapp, thank you each very much for joining us. Coming up, breaking news, the first charges in the Durham probe have been filed. We are starting to see real consequences for the embedded and systemic hostility shown in 2016 by some in the FBI. Is this just the beginning? We'll asked chairman of the judiciary committee, Senator Lindsey Graham, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOWDY: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity\". Tonight, we have huge breaking developments in our quest for equal justice. Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith is expected to plead guilty for falsifying evidence in the FISA warrant against Carter Page. This is the first criminal case arising from John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Remember, we first learned of Clinesmith's corruption in inspector General Michael Horowitz's findings last December where it was revealed he had actually altered an email and an apparent effort to falsely accuse Carter Page of being an agent of Russia. The I.G. report found that Comey's FBI lawyers omitted Page's prior relationship with another U.S. government agency prior to the filing of the final FISA warrant renewal application. The report goes on to explain that Clinesmith altered an email from the other agency believed to be the CIA which the FBI relied on to get a FISA warrant to unlawfully surveilled Carter Page. Here is the president reacting to the news earlier today. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey's very corrupt FBI is expected to plead guilty, you probably heard that. It just came out. So, that was just the beginning, I would imagine because what happened should never happen again. In fact, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOWDY: Now, Clinesmith wasn't shy about proclaiming his disdain for the president while inside Comey's FBI, texting a fellow FBI lawyer after the 2016 election, Clinesmith aid, I'm just devastated, adding that his name was all over the legal documents investigating his staff, if it could get worse, manufacturing evidence and allowing your personal beliefs to impact your work for the FBI, Clinesmith even declared himself part of the anti- Trump movement texting, viva la resistance. Now, of course, the biggest defenders and apologists for the FBI does misconduct were already out doing damage control following the charges. For example, Andrew Weissmann is lashing out, claiming that Barr has two systems of justice at play, that is the same Andrew Weissmann who said Roger Stone needs to go back in front of the grand jury to talk about Trump, not about election interference, not about Russia, not about protecting our democracy from outside influences, nope -- he wants Stone to testify against Trump. So, tonight, we are inching closer to finding out how pervasive FBI misconduct was in this sad chapter in American history. This did not originate with low-level rogue cops and lawyers. These were the highest levels of the FBI and DOJ. Comey, McCabe, Strzok, and others abuse the FISA court process, presented unverified and unfettered information to a court, promised to stop the Trump campaign and develop an insurance policy in case Trump won. Law enforcement and prosecutors are given special powers and authorities in our system. The power to arrest, to search, to seize, to impact reputations and freedom, they are not given the power to influence elections. The time for accountability is upon us. Joining me now for reaction, senator from the great state of South Carolina, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham. Welcome to you, Senator. How are you? SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): You're doing great. It's not as easy as it looks. It's that you're doing really good. I'm doing good. Trey, it's a good day for the rule of law. GOWDY: Yeah. You know, Senator, I was thinking on the way over here. Over the past four years, there have been more FBI employees indicted than there have been Trump family members. What does that say about what this country has been through over the last four years? GRAHAM: Well, there's a couple story lines today. An FBI lawyer in charge of reviewing warrants is going to plead guilty to falsifying documents to the FISA court against a Trump advisor, and if you are lucky, you'll find this in the mainstream media for 30 seconds. Can you imagine if the shoe were on the other foot and the FBI lawyer pled guilty today to falsifying documents against Hillary Clinton's advisors, it would be front page news. So, that's the world in which we live in. But I want to applaud Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general -- without him, we wouldn't have known this. And what this lawyer did is a really big deal. We have to trust the system. There's got to be a certain amount of trust. This is a lawyer, a man of the law, a member of the bar, who took it upon himself to falsify documents and to keep an investigation going that should have been stopped. Now, the media can't figure out why. Why? They hated Trump's guts. So this is a big day for the rule of law. And something tells me that Mr. Clinesmith knows where the bodies are buried, and if I were in the FBI working on Crossfire Hurricane, I'd be very worried right now. GOWDY: Speaking of working for the FBI and being worried, you were concerned that the FBI maybe had misled the Senate Intelligence Committee. Can you update us on that? What you have learned and what you're working on? GRAHAM: This is a big day for transparency and the rule of law. So, Mr. Horowitz -- it's not in his report, Trey, but he found a briefing document dated sometime in February 2018 that was prepared by the FBI because the Senate Intel Committee -- used to be on the House Intel Committee, had real concerns about the Russian sub-source. So, they asked the FBI to come in and brief them. So, I asked Director Wray, who did the briefing? Well, it's Bill Priestap. Who's this guy? He's one of the leaders of Crossfire Hurricane. A year after the sub-source told the FBI in 2017, there's no -- there is zero corroboration for the dossier, I wouldn't trust it with, you know, a solid grain of salt, hearsay, bar talk. They knew for over a year. And now, you've got Bill Priestap on February 15th, 2018, with four other people from the FBI, briefing this Senate Intel Committee, completely whitewashing the truth about the reliability of the dossier. Now, Director Wray has been really good. He's given me the information. More is going to follow. But what I want to do with this is turn it over to Durham because I think the briefing in 2018, a year after the sub-source told the FBI the dossier was a bunch of garbage, whitewashing that report at the Senate Intel Committee is potentially another crime. So, I'm going to send all this to Durham when I get it. GOWDY: Senator, the American people are watching Democrats and mayors of liberal and progressive cities complain about state and local police misconduct. Where is the outrage among Democrats when you have police misconduct over an entity they actually have power over, control over, which is the FBI? Why is there not more bipartisan outrage over the last four years? GRAHAM: To my Judiciary Committee Democrats -- this is about the rule of law. Many of you have been U.S. attorneys. What we have here is an FBI lawyer falsifying documents to the FISA court to keep an investigation going that should have stopped, falsifying documents to get a warrant against an American citizen, part of a presidential campaign. We now have in 2018, a year after sub-source told the FBI it was a bunch of garbage, the dossier, an effort by the FBI to lie to Congress and the reason Priestap lied to the Congress is if he told the Congress the truth about what the sub-source told the FBI, he would expose the lie to the court. So, Mr. Horowitz deserves a lot of credit here. Where is this thing going? The next thing I'm going to do, Trey, is I'm going to call to the committee and interview the case agent and the intel analyst who interviewed the Russian sub-source in January and March of 2017 and they got memos showing that it was a bunch of garbage, the guide denied the reliability of the dossier, it's bar talk, it was hearsay, it's zero corroboration. And here's a simple question: the most high-profile case may be ever in the history of the FBI, the document needed to get a warrant against Carter Page, completely fell apart in terms of reliability. Who did you tell? What's the likelihood that the people who interviewed the Russian sub- source did not tell McCabe, who's riding herd on the investigation, eventually Comey, oh, by the way, our case fell apart? That's where I'm headed. If they knew about this interview, if they got a warrant in April or June, months after the interview, they should go to jail. GOWDY: Senator, let me ask you quickly, we got about 20 seconds, what is the future, if any, of FISA? GRAHAM: It's hanging in the balance because people abuse power and God knows we need it because the terrorists are coming after us, and we've got to rehabilitate the system. The only way people are going to trust the FBI and FISA in the future is for people who lied, cheated, and manipulated to be fired and go to jail. Stay tuned. GOWDY: Well, thank you for staying up late with us tonight. I know it's past your bedtime. Thank you, Senator Graham. (LAUGHTER) GOWDY: Up next, President Trump traveled to New York City to visit his brother who is said to be seriously ill in a hospital. We'll have a live report. Plus, the Empire State is so out of control, Trump says New York may be in play on Election Day. We'll explain after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOWDY: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity\". Today, President Trump traveled to New York City to visit his brother Robert who was hospitalized with a serious illness. FOX News's Alex Hogan is live with the very latest on this -- Alex. ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trey, right now, the president is in New Jersey but earlier today, he stopped here at Real Cornell Medicine, here on the upper east side of Manhattan where his brother Robert was hospitalized. The president making that stop for about an hour, the White House not elaborating on his condition but saying that he is seriously ill. Robert is the youngest of five siblings. And at his press briefing, the president commenting on their close brotherly bond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I have a wonderful brother. We have a great relationship for a long time, from day one. It's a long time ago and he's in the hospital right now. Hopefully, he'll be all right. But he's pretty -- he's having a hard time. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOGAN: The 72-year-old served as a former top executive within the Trump Organization. He married his longtime partner in March and two months ago, Robert Trump filed temporary restraining order trying to block a tell-all book by his niece Mary. Earlier this year, Robert was hospitalized for about a week, there is still no word on his condition -- Trey. GOWDY: Alex Hogan, thank you. Also, tonight, one of the biggest campaign issues is the disastrous state of America's liberal-run cities, one of the worst is New York City, under the leadership of Mayor Bill de Blasio. President Trump tweeted today his intention to bring New York City back if we elected. But he will have his work cut out for him because the state's economic outlook was recently ranked worst in the nation. New York City residents are making a mad dash for the exits as reported by \"The New York Post\" and the tragic spike in violence in the city is also fueling this mass exodus, as the number of shootings in 2020 has come close to reaching the total for the same period in the last two years combined. Joining us now for reaction is Trump 2020 director of press communications, Erin Perrine and civil rights attorney Leo Terrell. Welcome to you both. LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHT ATTORNEY: Hi, Trey. How are you? GOWDY: I'm doing great. Thank you all. Mr. Terrell, I want to start with you. On a -- on a similar issue, but not all four squares. 2008, 2010, the Democrats had control of the House, the Senate, and the White House. If we in fact have systemic racism in our justice system, why not deal with it when you had all the gears of government? TERRELL: Trey, very good question. And 30 years of being a lawyer and a civil rights attorney, I can answer that, because there is no systemic discrimination in Democratic cities. If there was and you're right, the Democrats have the ability to control it. Look at all these cities burning up right now, Chicago, L.A., Portland, Seattle, New York, they are run by Democrats. And I'll tell you right now, the term systemic discrimination is Democrat talking point Kool-Aid. What's happening right now is that cities are burning. People don't want to live in New York, it's not safe, it's dangerous. People don't want to go there to pay taxes and more importantly, Trey, which I think is very important, that New York state is being run by the worst mayor in the country, an egomaniac governor, and Black Lives Matter and Antifa. And you heard what the Black Lives Matter spokesperson said in Chicago, it's okay to rob, it's okay to steal, people are hungry. Who would want to live in a state like New York? What they should do is follow the Trump economic plan and allowed Trump to bring in the National Guard. GOWDY: Erin, are there aspects of our current justice system that the president believes could be improved, should be improved if he were reelected? Does he have an agenda for how to make our justice system worthy of respect by all communities and the American family? ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: Well, there certainly is and President Trump has taken steps to reform the justice system in the United States. Criminal justice reform was done by President Trump, to make sure that first-time nonviolent offenders don't end up with ridiculously long prison sentences in the United States. Under the First Step Act, about 90 percent of those released from prison under President Trump, criminal justice reforms were black Americans. This is a president who is willing to take justice in the United States and make it blind the way it is supposed to be, but the scales of justice work how they are supposed to for Americans, you can trust the justice system. President Trump stepped up to be able to do that. And given a second term, he will again fight to be able to bring the levels of justice fairly for the American people. GOWDY: Mr. Terrell, I know you are an outstanding lawyer, I can't compete with you on legal issues so let me ask you a political one. I actually think Kamala Harris is historically significant, but I felt the same way about Mia Love. I feel the same way about Jaime Herrera Beutler from Washington state, and I have, of course, feel the same way about Tim Scott. But that has not kept the Democrats were trying to beat them at the election box. How do you acknowledge the historical significance of someone while at the same time disagreeing with them about the issues and try to defeat them on the issues? TERRELL: Well, first of all, before I answer the question, let me get my background setup because Erin got hers background setup. All right. Now, let me ask you the question. The problem is very simple: Kamala Harris was picked for the wrong reason. Kamala Harris was picked as a way to insulate Joe Biden from racism. Joe Biden, Trey, has been a person who said, wait, hey, if you don't vote for me, you ain't black. Black people think the same way. My point is simply this, Mia Love, Tim Scott, they were picked on merit. This country is about merit. Kamala Harris is an affirmative action selection to insulate Joe Biden about the racist attitudes he's had for the last 45 years. But the one thing Kamala Harris did say that is true is that Joe Biden is a racist at the debate. One final point, when you look at what Donald Trump has done the last three years as far as what Erin said, First Step, funding black historical colleges, trying to get justice reform and police reform through the Senate, but for Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. Donald Trump has done more for black Americans than Obama and Biden and Kamala Harris. GOWDY: Well, you're both right, we would've had a police reform but for Kamala Harris. Erin Perrine and Leo Terrell, thank you both for joining us. Hope you have a great weekend. When we come back, what is China doing and is there in a focus on it leading into the November elections? Senator Marco Rubio will join us after the break as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOWDY: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\" Yesterday, President Trump announced a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This was a huge foreign policy win for the Trump administration, but some Democrats and members of the media are downplaying it. Former Obama advisor Ben Rhodes tweeted: The agreement is dressed up as an election eve achievement between two leaders who want Trump to win. While Biden tried to take some credit for it, the media also minimize the achievement as \"NBC Nightly News\" refused to give President Trump any credit for his role in the deal and \"CBS Evening News\" suggested the president was actually stealing credit. Meanwhile, national security advisor Robert O'Brien warned that China is working to elect Biden and they have the most powerful and sophisticated tools to do so. Joining us now with the reaction is the acting Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida. Welcome, Senator Rubio. Thank you for joining us. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Good to be with you. This is the first time you're doing a show? (LAUGHTER) GOWDY: It is and I requested you specifically because you are -- I need you to explain to me the historical significance of this agreement between Israel and the UAE. RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's the first time that Israel makes a deal with an Arab country since (INAUDIBLE) of Egypt and Jordan thereafter. And it's important. You know, it's -- one of the things that makes Israel's life difficult is it's surrounded by countries that don't recognize it diplomatically. Now, it has different levels of engagement with these countries privately and so forth, but this is a major achievement. And I think as you highlight all of those media entities that refused to give the president any credit, the American people see it, right? I mean, the American people noticed that stuff, they don't just believe what they hear on the air. They start to pick up on the fact that in the eyes of most of the people now that run media companies, the president can do no right. Nothing he does -- if it's a big deal, they downplay it, if it is not a big deal, they play it up. It's a very significant achievement and one that I know has been in the works for a long time and took a lot of work. GOWDY: Well, Senator, ever since I met you in 2010, you have always had an interest and an expertise in foreign policy. I notice today that Turkey is unhappy with this agreement. I think they are NATO member. What if anything should we make of that? Or assign any importance to it? RUBIO: Well, Turkey has a deteriorating relationship with Israel, and it's had one for a while, but I think also Turkey under Erdogan, there's two things happening there. One is that they want to be sort of the dominant power in the region, sort of some of this Ottoman revisionism. At the same time, that helps Erdogan at home and domestically, they make him long strong. So, you know, obviously, Israel is not very popular in Turkey among many in the domestic audience there. So, but they don't like deals being done that they aren't a linchpin of. I think they are also crosswise a couple of regional conflicts as well. And Turkey is an interesting situation. They've gotten deeply involved now in Libya. They're in northern Syria, in one way they work with the Russians and in different ways, they are literally taking the Russians and/or their proxies on head on. So, and they've got conflicts now with Greece as well. So, it is -- it's a -- it's a messy situation right now unfortunately with the Turkish government. GOWDY: Let's pivot to China. What is the current state of our relationship with China? RUBIO: It's being rebalanced appropriately. You know, we went about 25 years in this country where everybody was sort of saying, don't worry, you let China cheat, when they get rich, they will become democratic and they'll follow the rules. Joe Biden was one of the leaders of that. When China went to the World Trade Organization, he said, don't worry, they're going to take our job. This is great for the world. Well, obviously, it hasn't worked out that way. If it feels like a lot of that is happening, it's because this president and this administration, the first president and administration in modern story to take on this challenge, is trying to make up for literally two decades of mistakes when it comes to China. We paid a tremendous price for what we have allowed them to do. They have stolen millions of American jobs, closed American factories and in the process gutted, you know, dozens of American communities, and the families that live here have been destroyed as a result of it. So, it's an important recalibration commercially. Geopolitically, it needed to happen. I'm glad it's finally started to happen. But it will be the work of a generation. GOWDY: Well, you touched on the electoral consequences if the White House switches or if the Senate switches, how would our relationship with China change? If there's a President Joe Biden or if there's a Chuck Schumer, what happens? RUBIO: Well, I think it goes back to the way it used to be. You know, certainly, when it comes to Joe Biden, he has a 30, 40-year, whatever story of being an orthodox politician on these topics. And all of these smart heads that go around talking about it -- some of them have come to that position, but many continue to, you know, criticize anything that the president does in terms of confronting China. Now, fortunately, this is a 75 to 80 percent issue in this country. That's why you see Democrats are actually supportive of it, but I anticipate -- to begin with, Biden doesn't have the strength to take on challenges that come with China, and doing so requires you to get in a fight with editorial boards and, you know, people at these fancy think tanks who all think that no matter what Donald Trump did, it was a mistake and we need to reverse everything he did even if it was in the best interest of our country -- because they cannot admit that anything this administration has done exactly the right thing to do. GOWDY: Well, Senator Rubio, thank you for joining us tonight and for your stewardship of the Intelligence Committee. Up next, Democrats continue to play politics with the COVID relief bill. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will join us live with the reaction next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOWDY: Welcome back to the \"Hannity\" special. President Obama is not shying away from the spotlight this election cycle. Today, he blasted President Trump who has valid concerns about an election disaster tied to mass mail-in voting. Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is scheduling a month-long recess because her coronavirus relief demands aren't being met. The price tag for her demands, which include things completely unrelated to COVID, $2 trillion. No wonder negotiators are miles apart on COVID-19 funding with little hope for a deal until September. Joining us now for reaction, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Welcome to you, Leader McCarthy. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thank you, Trey. I'm excited for your show tonight. GOWDY: Thank you. If you were the speaker of the House and you may be one day, how would you handle these negotiations? MCCARTHY: Well, the first thing, why do we think Nancy Pelosi would do anything different? From the very first bill any time we dealt with COVID, she has always tried to stop it. From our first bill, when we tried to get liability protection for 3M to sell its masks, she said no and gave us shortage when it came to personal equipment. Then when we try to make the COVID bill go through, she held it up for a CARES Acts so the Kennedy Center could have more money. Then when the small businesses were starving for money for PPP that was so successful to pay their employees, she proudly stood in front of her refrigerator and ate ice cream and told America, no, she wouldn't do it. The first thing I would do is take the trillion dollars that's already been appropriated but is sitting there with $100 billion more for the states, with more than $100 billion for small business, and I would use that instead of hurting, the hardworking taxpayers to borrow more money, because it's already appropriated and could be used. Luckily, we have a president that cares about people's paychecks and he's getting them out but he's also able to do a peace plan at the same time. GOWDY: Kevin, what's it going to take for the Republicans to retake the House and do you judge success as retaking the House or just picking up seats? MCCARTHY: I take success by retiring Nancy Pelosi. It only takes 17 seats. And, Trey, you know, just a short time ago when we were sworn in, it was 19 seats. We got a Democrat to flip and we just won a seat in California that Hillary carried by a majority in the Democrats won by nine points. We just won it by ten. But we really need to challenge. Democrats have more money than we do, but we've got better candidates. So, if you want to make a difference, we'll make it all the difference. GOWDY: Well, Kevin, my memory may be suspect, but when you were the majority leader, we would pass bills and the media narrative, even though we pass bills was, well, you can't do that because the Senate isn't going to take it up. I don't hear the same criticism when the Democrats pass a bill that has no chance of passing the Senate, it just seems like a lot of duplicity or is it just me with the media in D.C.? MCCARTHY: Well, no, I don't think it's just in D.C. But think about it -- Nancy Pelosi's version of solving the coronavirus was $3 trillion. But you know what it did? It mentioned pot more than it mentioned research or jobs. How does that do anything for anyone? What she has done, just think, what has she been able to do with San Francisco? She made it a sanctuary city. She has high taxes. She has sidewalks nobody wants to walk on. This is what she wants to do for the rest of America and now, Joe Biden, just picked the other person that's dealing with San Francisco -- Kamala Harris. That's a recipe for failure. GOWDY: OK, man, thank you for putting on a tie for us. Good weekend to you and Judy. Thank you for joining us. More of this special edition of \"Hannity\" coming up right after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOWDY: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\" Before we go, I want to tell you about my new book \"Doesn't Hurt to Ask: Using the Power of Questions to Communicate, Connect and Persuade.\" It's not about what I believe. It's about helping you prove what you believe. It's out next week and it will help you make your case and move others closer to your way of thinking. Thank you for joining us tonight. Sean will be back on Monday. \"The Ingraham Angle\" is up next. Have a great weekend. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "On 'The Daily Briefing,' Democratic congressional candidate makes the case for her representation in Texas. After MJ Hegar won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate for Texas in July, Democratic groups have been hoping the former Air Force helicopter pilot has a centrist appeal that gives the party the best shot at an upset in America\u2019s biggest red state. However, last month, Sen.\u00a0John Cornyn, R-Texas, her opponent, launched attack ads calling her \"too liberal,\" and a super PAC called Texans for a Conservative Majority released another ad saying she's \u201cNew York taxes, California values.\u201d Hegar, though, has attacked Cornyn's 18-year record that she contends has failed to deliver results. \u201cHi, I\u2019m MJ Hegar, I\u2019m a Purple Heart combat veteran and a working mom of two, and I am your opponent,\u201d Hegar told Cornyn in the only scheduled debate of their U.S. Senate race in early October. \u201cI am the person you\u2019re running against, as inconvenient as that is for you.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE Hegar, an underdog in a state where Democrats haven\u2019t won in 25 years, has focused on health care expansion, women\u2019s reproductive rights\u00a0and immigration policy. Like so many of her Democratic challenger colleagues, she supports efforts to \u201cimprove\u201d the existing Affordable Care Act, rather than scrap it altogether. She also has referenced\u00a0climate change extensively on the campaign trail, and supports setting \u201caggressive goals for the expansion of clean, renewable energy.\u201d Prior to her current run, Hegar ran unsuccessfully for Texas\u2019 31st congressional district. She won the Democratic primary but ultimately lost the seat to Republican stalwart John Carter. Hegar is a former member of the United States Air Force, something she wrote about in her memoir \u201cShoot Like A Girl.\u201d She was awarded a Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross. A back injury she sustained in a helicopter crash grounded her as a pilot. When she was excluded from applying from a ground combat position because she was a woman, she was the lead plaintiff in an ACLU suit that ultimately led to a lift of the ban in 2013. She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin (BA, MBA). She lives with her husband, Brandon, in Round Rock. She has two children. Hegar said that, regardless of her long-shot bid\u00a0to unseat the incumbent, this is a race she can win. She said upon securing the nomination in July: \u201cThe grassroots energy that has jelled behind this campaign, and my ability to connect with people because I am a regular working Texas mom has really pushed us to this point.\u201d",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Special Report. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey there, Bret. Good evening. Good to see you. BAIER: Good evening. MACCALLUM: So, breaking tonight, President Trump en route to a rally in Swanton, Ohio right now. We understand he's a bit behind schedule, slated to appear at 7. We're going to get you there live, dip in and out of that as soon as that gets underway. It is his third trip to Ohio this year. Joe Biden has not been to Ohio as the nominee, but he was in Wisconsin today. More on that in a moment. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is THE STORY. So, just when you thought that it couldn't get any more intense, the battle is now more pitched than ever, with both sides saying that the other is, playing with fire and with the president plowing ahead on the Supreme Court as Democrats threaten impeachment and more. We'll dig into all of this in just a moment. But first, let's give you the lay of the land in Ohio tonight to show you why the president is where he is tonight. Swanton, Ohio straddles two counties, Fulton, which voted for President Trump in 2016, and Lucas, which voted for Hillary Clinton. Earlier today, he spent some time on the ground in Dayton. That's Montgomery County, which narrowly voted for him back then. But today, the suburbs in Ohio have drifted away from the president and he is trying to get them back as he campaigns there. Ohio has nine counties that supported President Obama and then flipped to candidate Trump in 2016. Now, four of those, Ottawa, Wood, Sandusky, and Erie are in the area where we will see the president speak tonight for good reason for his campaign. Some of those places turned blue in the midterms in 2018. Now let's go over to Joe Biden on the other side of the equation. He was in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, this afternoon. He spent a lot of time in a speech there talking about the middle class, appealing to them, also talking a lot about COVID-19. He accused the president of being elitist essentially, and he never spoke in this speech, he did on Saturday, but not at all today about the Supreme Court vacancy. Here's a bit of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It was, you know, Joe Biden, if elected, will be only the first president who didn't go to an Ivy League school a long time. I say it's about time that a state school president sat in the Oval Office, because, you know what, if I'm sitting there, you're going to be sitting there too. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Direct appeal to blue collar working voters in Manitowoc, Wisconsin today. But, of course, the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg has created a major inflection point in this already tumultuous election that we are in the middle of. Now, keep in mind, since 1975, it's taken an average of 40 days to - for a nominee to even get to the Senate hearing stage and then 70 days between their nomination and their actual confirmation. So, this is a very tight schedule. There are 43 days to go until Election Day. So, where is this headed? We start tonight with Tom Cotton, who earlier this month was one of the names on the list of the president's potential Supreme Court nominees. Senator, good to have you here tonight. He has said quite clearly that it's a woman. So, sorry to tell you. I don't think that you're in the running at this point, at least unless we see some big changes. First of all, do you think it's wise and appropriate for him to make that distinction here? SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Yes, Martha, I think the president has many capable female candidates on the list that he's released in the past, and I suspect he'll choose one this week and send it forward to the United States Senate. That's what he campaigned on doing in 2016. And we will process that nominee without delay. We did that not only in 2016, but in 2018 too, when there couldn't have been a clear referendum. Just one month after the Brett Kavanaugh vote. Four Democratic senators voted against him. They lost their re-election. One voted for him and won. So, the American people returned a Republican majority to the Senate to do exactly what we intend to do, which is confirm the president's eventual nominee. MACCALLUM: But what about timing, when you look at the time frames that we just mentioned, it is a very close until the election. So, what if there's a scenario where President Trump loses, and would then a nominee be pushed through in the lame duck session? COTTON: Well, first off, Martha, the president is going to win, I think he'll win a resounding victory on November 3rd, and I expect the American people will vote for a Republican Senate majority again. In part because they want to see judges on the Supreme Court who understand the difference between making the law and applying the law. In part because they see what the Democrats are already promising to do. And now they've started threatening it even more explicitly since Justice Ginsburg's death on a Friday. You have radical Democrats saying that they're going to pack the Supreme Court if we fill this vacancy. Why do they want to do that? They want the Supreme Court to be a rubber stamp for their radical Left-wing agenda. They want Congress and state legislatures to be able to violate the Second Amendment and pass laws confiscating guns, and they want the Supreme Court to rubber stamp it. That's a reason why the American people are not going to vote for Democrats come November 3rd. But whatever happens in terms of the timing of the president's nomination, the Senate will move forward without delay. We'll take a careful, thorough, deliberate approach to it and we will confirm that nominee, I'm confident. MACCALLUM: Just a bit of news just crossing as you were talking from your colleague, Cory Gardner in Colorado, who's obviously in a tight race there. He is essentially saying, he says, when a president exercises constitutional authority to nominate a judge for the Supreme Court vacancy, the Senate must decide how to best fulfill its constitutional duty of advice and consent. I have and will continue to support judicial nominees who will protect our Constitution, not legislate from the bench. Should a qualified nominee who meets this criteria be put forward? I will vote to confirm. He was one of several, including Mitt Romney and potentially Senator Grassley, who were seen to be somewhat on the bubble. We've heard already from Murkowski and Collins. Your thoughts on your colleague's statement tonight? COTTON: Well, I'm not at all surprised to hear Cory Gardner say that. Cory has been a very strong advocate for having judges from the Supreme Court down to the trial courts who understand their role in our constitutional system, their role to apply the law, not to make the law. That's one reason why he was such a strong advocate for Neil Gorsuch to become a Supreme Court justice, having come from Colorado. So that's not surprising to me at all. I believe that once we get the nominee, that nominee will be highly capable. The Senate will be thorough and careful. We won't cut corners; we won't skip steps. But there is more than enough time to confirm the president's nominee, perhaps before the election, certainly by the end of the year. MACCALLUM: All right. So, obviously there's a lot of discussion about the choice that Mitch McConnell, Senator McConnell made back in 2016. And you spoke out at that point as well. This is you in light of the Merrick Garland nomination by President Obama, which was nine months from the election at that point. Here's what you said then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COTTON: And a few short months, we will have a new president and new senators. You can consider the next justice with the full faith of the American people. Why would we cut off the national debate about this next justice? Why would we squelch the voice of the people? Why would we deny the voters a chance to weigh in on the makeup of the Supreme Court? (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, what do you say about that now? And you look back at that time and it is the Senate's constitutional duty to advise and consent and even that part of the duty of the Senate was not carried out at that point for Merrick Garland. COTTON: So, Martha, remember, in 2014, we had an election in which we won a smashing victory, a large majority delivered in part to put the brakes on the Obama agenda for the final two years of the Obama presidency. So, it shouldn't be a surprise that when a Democratic president submitted a Supreme Court justice, the Republican Senate did not want to confirm that justice. That's exactly how we exercise our advice-- MACCALLUM: But why not take it to the vote. COTTON: Nor should - well, nor should anyone be surprised, Martha, that with a Republican president and a Republican Senate that we plan to move forward to confirm exactly the kind of nominee that we promised in 2018. Remember, we could not have had a clearer referendum with the voters in 2018, just one month after the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation. We promised that we would continue to confirm the president's highly capable judicial nominees and that's exactly what we're going to do. MACCALLUM: Well, I mean a lot of people look back at that and they look at the statements that were made by some of your colleagues, Lindsey Graham and others, who basically said, if this were to happen close to the election, we would not move forward. We would wait until after the election. So, I mean, it's going to be up to the voters to decide how they feel about all of that. We just sort of lay it down for the record here. Here is Joe Biden appealing to GOP senators on the Supreme Court confirmation in Philadelphia yesterday. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens. Please follow your conscience. The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, your reaction to what he said and how wobbly do you think, for lack of a better word, some senators might be in this process on your side? COTTON: Well, Joe Biden and the Democrats can spare their crocodile tears. Look, we know what they really think. Joe Biden said in 2016 that a Senate held by the opposition party should vote on a president's nominee. So, certainly he thinks that a Senate with the same party as the White House should vote on a president's nominee. He just upset that it's the Republican Party, not the Democratic Party. But in the meantime, Joe Biden supporters are rioting and protesting on private homes like Lindsey Graham's and Thom Tillis' and Mitch McConnell's over the weekend because they want to take this out of the constitutional process, they want to say we're going to take radical steps like packing the Supreme Court if you move forward. But remember, they were promising those things before this weekend, so they can spare the crocodile tears and the idle threats. MACCALLUM: All right. We're going to talk a lot about their potential for packing the Supreme Court, making Puerto Rico and D.C. potentially states, which would add four more senators into the mix. So, lots more on that to come. Senator, thank you. Good to have you here tonight as always, sir. COTTON: Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, we bring in Geraldo Rivera now, Fox News Correspondent-at- Large. Geraldo, great to have you with us as always as well. GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: I know that you feel very differently than Senator Cotton about this move, tell me. RIVERA: I sure do. I think, first of all, hypocrisy. Follow your conscience. I mean, who are we kidding, Martha? This is about abortion and abortion rights. That's what this is about. This is about the Supreme Court of the United States. If a new justice is confirmed, is voted on and confirmed successfully before the end of the first term of President Trump's tenure, it will affect for decades the fight over reproductive rights. This is about Roe v. Wade. This is about the fact that that Supreme Court is now has in its hands Roe v. Wade, which is a constitutional right, but it's not written in stone. It can easily be overthrown by a new court with a different ideological majority. This, I was thinking more thought to myself, how is it that this is our lead story and the lead story of all the newscasts this evening in the face of all the suffering, the extraordinary pain the United States and the rest of the world have gone through because of the Coronavirus. We're now 200,000 Americans dead. And yet the focus is on the Supreme Court. Why is that? It is, I think with all due respect to all the people who have lost so much and suffered so much, we will get over the Coronavirus. This too shall pass in the relative - a year or so. But the Supreme Court, one that Amy Coney Barrett is 48 years old. Barbara Lagoa is 52 years old. For decades, they will now sit on the Supreme Court. One of them will sit on the Supreme Court if this vote is pulled off and affect how we feel about, how we - legislation about Roe v. Wade. It's a very, very big deal as the father of three daughters, this is the issue, this is-- MACCALLUM: As you know, the country is very divided on that issue. So, there would be a lot of people who would be very supportive if they thought that this would be something that would overturn Roe v. Wade. But Amy Coney Barrett is on the record as saying that she doesn't believe that there will be a change in Roe v. Wade. She said it's possible that there could be impacts on some of the later term abortion issues. But she has basically said that she sees it as settled law. Brett Kavanaugh said the same thing in the course of his Supreme Court hearings. And I think there are many issues. It is not just that issue. There are many issues that conservative justices would obviously feel strongly about. The most important of which is adhering to the Constitution as written as textualists in terms of the way they approach it, rather than making laws based on current events and how they see them molded through cases. I mean, that's really the core of the issue, I think, for most people. RIVERA: I respectfully disagree. I was in the Supreme Court of the United States in December of 2000. It happened to be the day that I was admitted to the Supreme Court bar, so that all the justices were there arrayed in all their splendor, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It was one of the great days of my life. And later that day, they argued Bush v. Gore. This is now a four-four Supreme Court. If we don't get that ninth justice confirmed. A four-four Supreme Court. This election could very well follow the Gore-Bush election of 2000 and be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. How do they decide if it's a four-four vote? That's why the Republicans have this urgency. Now, I think that there's a political calculation, hard, cold calculation that the Republicans have made, that they gain more votes by motivating their following, by pushing through this nomination then they lose now. Now, it might be, and you know how I feel about President Trump. It may be that he's motivated by a higher calling that this is really - because he feels so deeply, so profoundly about the issue of abortion, opposing abortion. It could be that he's going to sacrifice everything, that he's going to bet everything on this roll of the dice, that this insistence on getting that ninth judge is so important to him because of his conscience and his heart that'll risk everything. MACCALLUM: Well, you may have just touched on something very important there. I mean, we may see this go to the courts, this election, as we saw in 2000. And just based on everyone's self-interest of any politician, it would be understandable, a Democrat or Republican that they would want to push through the nominee of their choosing before they leave. And it is the constitutional duty of a president. This was said by Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself. She said, you don't stop being president before the last month or day of your presidency. And it is incumbent upon a president to choose someone. All he does is choose that individual. Then it is up to the Senate to decide whether or not they're going to hold hearings. And that is the advice and consent role is also their mandate. Quick thought and then I've got to go. RIVERA: I adore constitutional discussions and philosophy. I still believe very strongly, Martha, that this is about a woman's right to choose. I was there in Washington, D.C., the day after President Trump was inaugurated. I saw hundreds of thousands of female protesters wearing those pink hats, all about the right to choose. This is what will motivate voters, pro or con, on this referendum on President Trump on November 3rd. This - I think at the strip, the rest of it, I think that this hardcore discussion is what's all about. MACCALLUM: I mean, I think you're right that this will be what senators will try to get to the heart of in the hearing process here without a doubt. We all remember Dianne Feinstein saying to Amy Coney Barrett in her - when she was being approved for her current position as a judge, that the dogma lives strongly within you. I wonder if she would have said that to anyone of another faith. But you're right. We're going to hear a lot about this if we get to the hearing stage before the election. So, Geraldo, it's always good to have you with us. Thank you so much. RIVERA: Thank you, Martha. Thank you. MACCALLUM: We'll see you soon. So, coming up, Joe Biden campaigning in Wisconsin as we have said. Polls have him there up by about 7 at this point. The former vice president didn't mention the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, shied away from that issue in his remarks today. He did talk about it on Saturday and then he said whoever wins in November is the person who should determine that nominee. But that is not what he said years ago. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So, President Trump is now wheels up, we understand, to Swanton, Ohio, where he's expected to address the looming showdown over the Supreme Court vacancy. There is a live shot of the crowd waiting for him in Swanton, Ohio, tonight. His opponent, Joe Biden, did not mention the court issue while he was on the trail in Wisconsin this afternoon. He did really talk a lot though, about issues of elitism and Park Avenue, a line of thinking and narrative that he is very much leaning into at this point, trying to paint President Trump as in that category and himself as a champion of every man in Wisconsin today. So, after he previously pushed for the Senate to hold off on an empty seat until Election Day, now he feels differently. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Just a few weeks, all votes, this nation will be heard, they're the ones who the Constitution vision should decide who has the power to make this appointment. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So that in direct contradiction to what then Vice President Biden told The New York Times back in 2016. When he said, the president has the constitutional duty to nominate. The Senate has the constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent. It is written plainly in the Constitution that both presidents and senators swear an oath to uphold and defend. Here now, Deroy Murdock, contributing editor for the National Review Online and a Fox News Contributor. And Scott Bolden, Attorney, and former Chairman of the DC Democratic Party. Gentlemen, great to have both of you with us. Thank you very much. SCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER DC DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Scott, let me begin with you, if I may. Your reaction to those contradictory statements by Joe Biden on this issue? BOLDEN: Well, I don't think they're contradictory in one sense. We all believe that in 2016 and then Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, changed the rule, whether it's a rule written or otherwise, he disagreed. And he essentially stole a Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, from the Dems or from Obama to make that appointment. Got it, right. And even Senator Graham said at the time, you're making a new rule and it's going to come back to bite us or it may come back to bite us. Well, a year out now, 45 days before an election, the same thing has happened. We have a Republican president and Mitch McConnell is still there. He is the only person that has the power to advice and counsel and set a vote. He had it in 2016, has it 2020 and now he is the one that is reversed. And what you hear the Democrats arguing about is his hypocrisy and the GOP's hypocrisy on this. Not that they should move with haste, if you will, but Mitch McConnell and the GOP changed the rules and now they want to implement the old rule again. And it's going to come with repercussions. MACCALLUM: I mean, there is an argument, Deroy, good argument I think that the sort of current state of Supreme Court tensions that we have - that we had in the Brett Kavanaugh moment do date back to that decision, right or wrong, from Mitch McConnell, because prior to that, we had Lindsey Graham, for example, voting for Sotomayor, voting for Kagan. Most of the votes prior to that were overwhelmingly in favor of the president's choice. And after that moment, we did see a very big change in how all of this plays out. What do you say, Deroy? DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We certainly had very, very contentious, and tumultuous Supreme Court battles, starting with Robert Bork back under Reagan and certainly with the Clarence Thomas nomination, those are not nice, smooth battles at all, as you might know. And I think this whole - as we think about this whole situation, Martha you've touched on this a little bit, but we ought to think about the wise words of none other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And she said, and I'm quoting, there's nothing in the Constitution that says the president stops being the president in his last year. And it is the president's constitutional duty to fill this vacancy. It is the Senate's duty to advise and consent. They may decide not to accept the nomination, but they need to move forward on this. And I think the reasoning - among the reasons they need to do it right now is that we've got this incredibly complicated, bizarre election with all these mess mail- in-ballots flying around all over the place. And we may get to a situation where we have to have the Supreme Court step in with the Michigan recount or the Pennsylvania recount or recounts elsewhere. And if it comes down to a four-four tie, how are we going to decide what to do if the Supreme Court deadlocks, we will get a ninth justice there, so we can have a five-four decision one way or the other. MACCALLUM: That is one of the most compelling reasons to make sure that there are nine. And we heard, Justice Sotomayor actually said the same thing. She said, back in 2018 that you have to have nine. There's a reason why we need nine. And so, I think that that's an important consideration. Take a look at this, Marquette University Law School - one second Scott, Marquette University Law School poll taken in the days before Ginsburg's death, 67 percent say that hearings should be held in a hypothetical Supreme Court vacancy. Only 32 percent said that the hearings should not be held, Scott. BOLDEN: Yes, well, again, who's driving this narrative isn't Marquette. It isn't Biden, it isn't Obama. It's Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader in the Senate. But for him and what he did in 2016, we probably wouldn't be having this debate in 2020. But we are. And by the way, we've had eight Supreme Court justices before. We don't know how they're going to vote if you will. But this is a power grab on the part of Mitch McConnell and the GOP to stack the deck on the conservatism of the Supreme Court. And listen, I understand politics. MACCALLUM: As President Obama said, elections have consequences. And we do see that. We see that playing out in a very big way here. But Mitch McConnell as the Senate majority leader based on the fact that Republicans have the majority in the Senate. So that is his role, like it or not. BOLDEN: But there are risk associated with this with Senator McConnell as well. He has individuals who are in tight races, in red states that I've got to tell you, the Democratic electorate is going to be highly, highly motivated, not just highly motivated, and he puts them at risk. The other thing is, we've got to figure out whether they are four or more who are going to go along with Mitch McConnell or not. They may not be. And so, there are a lot of steps in between. But I will tell you that the Dems could impeach him. I think that's a waste of time if you will. MACCALLUM: It is. BOLDEN: But when you make a move like he's moving, making I've got to tell you, there are going to be repercussions and if the Democrats win-- MACCALLUM: All right, let me get Deroy in here, before we go. But I would just say that if they do go down the impeachment road, which would probably be politically perilous for them, it will just get tabled in the Senate. MURDOCK: Exactly. MACCALLUM: So that's why I said, yes, it's a waste of time. Deroy, quick thought before we go. MURDOCK: Just quickly, Chuck Schumer said, I'm quoting, our system of checks and balances requires nine SCOTUS justices playing politics only weakens our democracy. And if the shoe were on the other foot and we had Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Hillary Clinton and one of the conservative justices passed away, it would be full speed ahead for the Democrats with the mainstream media cheering along and it would be a totally different story and there probably be hearings next week already. MACCALLUM: Yes, we do not live in changing times. This is hardball politics across the board. And I don't doubt Deroy. We've got to go. Thank you very much, Scott, Deroy. BOLDEN: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Good to have both of you with us tonight. So, Democrats are warning that the GOP is playing fire, as we've just have been talking about, and that there will be consequences if they win the presidency and the Senate among them. They could potentially expand the size of the court in order to gain a liberal majority, adding two, adding four. Brett Tolman has worked as counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has some very interesting thoughts on this when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So as top Republicans press forward to fill the now empty Supreme Court seat in the wake of Justice Ginsburg's death Democrats are threatening to answer by potentially in the future expanding the number of justices who serve to balance out the court. Something that Congress hasn't done since 1869. House judiciary chair Jerry Nadler tweeted in part, quote, \"filling the SCOTUS vacancy during a lame duck session after the American people have voted for new leadership is un-Democratic and a clear violation of the public trust and elected officials. Congress would have to act and expanding the court would be the right place to start.\" Says chairman Nadler. So former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder echoed that sentiment. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE United STATES:\u00a0 If, in fact, they are successful in placing a justice on the court, we need to think about court reform and at a minimum as part of that reform package, I think additional justices need to be placed on the Supreme Court. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Joining me now, Brett Tolman, former Senate Judiciary Committee counsel and former federal prosecutor. Good to have you with us. I actually want to begin by playing -- BRETT TOLMAN, FORMER SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COUNSEL:\u00a0 Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 -- this sound bite from Joe Biden in October 15th, 2019. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 I would not get into court packing. We had three justices, next time around we lose control, they had three justices. We begin to lose any credibility for the court has at all. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 It seems like a pretty logical take. What's your take? TOLMAN:\u00a0 It is logical. It reminds me of many years ago, you had seasoned veterans like Senator Hatch and even Senator Leahy and Grassley and others who warned their respective sides about making drastic changes like this. And you know, as a, what it reminds me of, Martha, is somebody who is in the middle of a ball game and is really upset and wants to take the ball and go home or rewrite the rules because they don't like what's happening and that's what we see going on all around us with these threats that are being thrown out. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, you know, I mean, there's other things that are being considered that we heard about. Impeachment process for, you know, basically having the gumption to go ahead and deal with the Constitution dictates at this point, there's also the possibility of adding Puerto Rico and D.C. as states which would add four new senators and in those cases, I think it's safe to assume that they would likely be Democrat. You know, that could not be true but that's the way it looks from here. Your thoughts on some of the other things that they are suggesting and the fact that someone like Eric Holder and Jerry Nadler are among those who are kind of putting it into the bloodstream as an option. TOLMAN:\u00a0 Yes. I mean, this is outrageous to a degree that the individuals that are complaining that Mitch McConnell is using his position of authority to achieve a political end is willing to go to the extreme of actually modifying our very governing documents as well as doing whatever it takes to give them an advantage to give a liberal majority on the court. They've proven that what they don't care about is the Constitution itself. But they don't care about is the rule of law because the ends justify any means you have to get there and that's what I don't want to see. I don't want to see the Republicans do that if they were in power or the Democrats to do it if they are in power. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, you worked at the Senate judiciary committee, you know, it is a very tight time frame. TOLMAN:\u00a0 Yes. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 What should we be watching in terms of how this is going to go? TOLMAN:\u00a0 I will tell you, the president needs to nominate and do it immediately and they need to have an individual that they can all focus on. That's the members of the Senate and the judiciary and Senator Graham has his work cut out for him. He's going to have to try to keep both the Republicans in line and bring folks like Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, maybe even Senator Romney. I think Amy Coney Bryant (Ph) -- Barrett is a fantastic nominee. I think she has the background that will rally individuals on the right, but he has to do it quickly and you have to see a chairman exercise some leadership that the country starts to see that they are having a legitimate process go forward, and let's face it, this is their time to work and to act according to the laws on the authority we've given them. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Brett Tolman, always good to see you. Thank you so much, Brett. We'll see you soon. TOLMAN:\u00a0 Good to see you. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You bet. TOLMAN:\u00a0 Thanks. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So, coming up, President Trump is expected soon in Swanton, Ohio, a preview of the crowd on the ground there tonight. We'll be back. Stick around. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\u00a0 This November if you want jobs, if you want opportunity, if you want safety, and if you want a president who defends the dreams of workers in Dayton and Akron and all across Ohio and America, then you need to get out and vote for Trump and Mike Pence. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Just a short time ago and it's a pretty quick trip from Dayton to Swanton, so you can see on the ground there, Air Force One has just landed, the president is preparing to make his second appearance in Ohio this evening. In 2016, he won the state by eight points. Tonight, he will address the crowd there. It is a city on the border of Fulton and Lucas Counties as we said. So, it's an area where Hillary Clinton won one of those counties. President Trump won the other one. He won 64 percent of the vote in 2016 there, and as I said, losing Lucas County with -- to Hillary Clinton with just 38 percent of the votes. So that's an area where he is looking to pick up some ground. National correspondent Bryan Llenas is there tonight and he joins us now. Hi, Bryan. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Martha, good evening. Air Force One just landing here at the airport in Toledo, Ohio. You know, no president, no Republican candidate has won the presidency without winning Ohio and its 11 electoral votes. The president starting in Dayton tonight and then just landed here in Toledo 150 miles north. The big picture here in Ohio, President Trump won by eight points by flipping nine counties that had voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and in 2012. Toledo is right near four of those pivotal counties. And the latest polls had the race here neck and neck between Biden and Trump. Now, both the Vice President, Mike Pence, and Donald Trump Jr. have made campaign stops here in Ohio over the last couple of weeks and frankly, you couldn't find a bigger contrast between the president campaigning style and Biden than here in Ohio. Biden has not visited Ohio since March. They have been heavily relying on television ads, but this was the president just moments ago speaking about the message that he has had for all Ohio voters that the economy is stronger under him. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:\u00a0 The choice in November is going to be very simple. There's never been a time where there is such a difference. One is probably communism. I don't know, they keep saying socialism. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping your jobs to China and foreign countries. You know that. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And I've spent the last four years bringing the jobs back to our country. (END VIDEO CLIP) LLENAS:\u00a0 Eighty thousand jobs have been added here in Ohio under President Trump's presidency, but the reality is that 400,000 jobs have been lost in Ohio under the pandemic. When you speak to voters here, they blame the Republican governor DeWine, but the Biden campaign came out with a statement today saying that it was the president's bungled response to the pandemic that has less -- led to lost jobs here in Ohio. The bottom line though, when we spoke to voters here, they also had big opinions when it came about -- when it comes to the Supreme Court vacancy. We spoke to some voters. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 I am excited for the Supreme Court justice, and I think Amy Barrett sounds like an awesome candidate. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Motivation is his right for religious freedom, for abortion, for the Supreme Court justices, for what he's done for immigration, for building the wall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 We've been disappointed with Roberts in many of his decisions, they haven't been consistent with what he had claimed to be before. I think it's important that we have rule of law. (END VIDEO CLIP) LLANES:\u00a0 Ohio at center stage tonight and just over a week from now will be center stage again where our Chris Wallace will be moderating the very first presidential debate on September 29th. Martha? MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes, we are heading out there next weekend, and we're looking forward to it. Bryan, thank you so much. We're going to take you live back to President Trump in Ohio this evening right after this. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 So here is the scene in Swanton, Ohio as you can tell. They are waiting for President Trump to get off of Air Force One this evening. So, I'm going to bring in Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall and a Fox News contributor, and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and syndicated radio host. Thanks to both of you for being here tonight. You know, we talked earlier in the show about Mitch McConnell and the Merrick Garland part of this story and then when you kind of move forward, you look what happened with Brett Kavanaugh and there is no doubt that there was a lot of residual anger over Merrick Garland that kind of flowed into that part of the process, and that now we see much more contentious tighter situations with regards to these votes. I just want to remind everybody because Kamala Harris obviously is still a senator and is a big part of the equation here. This is the exchange between Kamala Harris and Brett Kavanaugh back then. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT:\u00a0 The FBI would gather witness statements. Do you have witness statements? (CROSSTALK) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA):\u00a0 Sir, it's -- I'm not -- I don't want to debate with you how they do their business. Are you willing to ask the White House to do it? And say yes or no, and then we can move on. KAVANAUGH:\u00a0 They had six background investigations over 26 years -- (CROSSTALK) HARRIS:\u00a0 Sir, as it relates to the recent allegations, are you willing to have them do it? KAVANAUGH:\u00a0 The witness testimony is before, no witness who was there supports that I was there. HARRIS:\u00a0 OK. I'm going to take that as a no and then we can move on. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Wow. You know, Katie, it takes you right back to how tense it was back then and you have to kind of feel for what's coming with these potential candidates and what they're probably going to be put through. KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Yes, not only was it tense but it was unjust, unfair, and dishonest. There were a number of smears that were launched against Brett Kavanaugh and his family that ended up not being true. You know, the media sure blew up all of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh but when the Senate judiciary committee issued a 400-plus page report showing the detailed investigations of every single one of those claims and whether they panned out with witness testimony or evidence, none of them ended up being true. In fact, a number of people who made claims that they made them up and they were referred for criminal prosecution by the Senate judiciary committee to the Department of Justice. There is no excuse for what happened to Brett Kavanaugh, and the fact is that Republican senators in the past regardless of political disagreements have voted for nominees put up by people like President Obama and President Clinton. And yet here we are now with Democrats demanding that there be some kind of grace and trust when it comes to future nominees and holding off, or that there would be any grace given or respect to their nominee, and yet they haven't shown any of that and they didn't show it during the Kavanaugh case. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Well, I'm sad to say that grace seems to be something that's been completely lost in Washington, D.C., and revisiting, and you're right, Katie, you know, when you look through that report of the after action on that, it is despicable and it's also despicable you didn't hear more about that report, Chris Hahn, in terms of what they uncovered and how difficult and dismal that whole chapter was. PAVLICH:\u00a0 Yes. CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER:\u00a0 Well, you know, this is the environment that Mitch McConnell created when he blocked Merrick Garland and not just blocked Merrick Garland, he refused to vote on any Obama judicial nominees on any level which led to the elimination of the filibuster for judicial nominees below Supreme Court. This is what that that ring -- brings. McConnell is responsible for the environment in Washington more than any other individual in this country, more than Donald Trump, more than anybody else. He has brought this on himself and now his blatant act of hypocrisy filling a seat 46 days before an election -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. But Chris, as you know as well as I do -- (CROSSTALK) HAHN:\u00a0 -- when he said he wouldn't do it for 10 months. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You know what, I understand where you're coming from and I think it's true that a lot of people would agree with you that it traces back to then. You can also go back to very contentious Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork so it's not as if it has never happened in the past. PAVLICH:\u00a0 Yes. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 There's President Trump coming down the escalator -- (CROSSTALK) HAHN:\u00a0 John Roberts got in without any fight at all. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 -- not the escalator -- the terrace. No. It used to be different. HAHN:\u00a0 I mean, there's -- (CROSSTALK) LEMON:\u00a0 There's no doubt about it. It used to be different. HAHN:\u00a0 Yes. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You know, with regard to Ohio, I just want to switch gears with both of you for a moment here because this is becoming perhaps a more tightly contested state, Katie, when you look at the suburbs and the changing nature of Ohio, this is no longer a place that the president can count on necessarily and he is working hard there to counter -- counteract that. Your thoughts? PAVLICH:\u00a0 Yes. I think the president has made it clear that he is not going to take any state for granted, no voters for granted. And he watches the show up in states that he won to remind that he doesn't forget that they put him into the White House last time around. Ohio is one of those places he is going to have to fight for the votes, Pennsylvania is another one but Minnesota is one that Joe Biden is losing ground in. So, the map can change very quickly -- MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. PAVLICH:\u00a0 -- and it has over the recent days. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 I got about 20 seconds, Chris, your thoughts before we go? HAHN:\u00a0 Always run scared, the president has got to run scared in Ohio, he's got to run scared in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, states that should be solid for him. They are running away from him because he is a failure on COVID-19 and our economy. And America just wants to have peace. They don't want to think about the president all the time. He makes us have to do that, that's why this election is so tight. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. Both sides here tonight. Thank you both. Good to have you here as we watch the president in Swanton, Ohio. More of THE STORY and the president right after this. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Thanks for joining us tonight, everybody. That is THE STORY of Monday, September 21st. But as always, THE STORY goes on. So, we'll see you back here tomorrow night at seven. President Trump is in Pennsylvania. Good night. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Gary Peters,\u00a0a Democrat, is fighting for a second\u00a0term in the Senate against GOP\u00a0businessman John James in the critical swing state of Michigan. Republicans believe they have a real pick-up opportunity in the Great Lakes State in their effort to maintain control of the Senate. But Democrats view holding onto Michigan as the first step in winning back the chamber\u00a0for the first time since 2014. \"We have a real shot to take the majority in the United States Senate,\" Peters said on Saturday. \"But one thing we must do is we must win here. We must hold this seat.\" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., speaks at a rally for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama at Northwestern High School in Flint, Mich., Saturday, Oct. 31, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) With the control of the Senate\u00a0on the line, money has been pouring into the race.\u00a0The Peters-James face-off is expected to top $100 million in spending, making it the most expensive election in Michigan's history, according to the\u00a0Michigan Campaign Finance Network. Peters, 61, is a former congressman, Michigan state senator and former Michigan Lottery Commissioner. He's pitched himself as a bipartisan bridge builder who gets real results for Michigan behind the scenes, in contrast to his charismatic\u00a0and TV-ready opponent. WHO IS JOHN JAMES? 7 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT MICHIGAN'S SENATE CANDIDATE Here's seven\u00a0things to know about Peters. 1) He was the only freshman Democrat elected to the Senate in 2014 Peters was a sitting congressman hardened by several tough previous elections when he beat Republican Terri Lynn Land in 2014 for the seat vacated by the retiring Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. His victory put him in\u00a0a class by himself as the lone new Democrat. Republicans nationwide had a great year and won back control of the Senate so Peters was surrounded by celebratory Republicans in his freshman class. GOP CONTROL OF SENATE IN JEOPARDY, COULD HINGE ON GEORGIA IN JANUARY RUNOFF Six years later, Republicans are now playing defense with a dozen\u00a0incumbents now in competitive races. Peters is the only target for Republicans to go on offense with Tuesday,\u00a0aside from\u00a0Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., who entered the Senate surprisingly in\u00a0a 2017 special election when he beat Republican Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct with teenage\u00a0girls.

He loves to campaign on his motorcycle too\u00a0and embarks on a motorcycle tour of the state each year. The ride is over 1,000 miles from Detroit to the Upper Penisula and back. 3) He's pushed back on Hunter Biden investigations in the Senate Peters is the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. That means he sits opposite\u00a0Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the committee chairman, who has led the effort to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of the Democratic presidential nominee, over his foreign business dealings. Peters accused Johnson and Republicans of using the committee to try to manufacture dirt on the former vice president and to help President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Peters said the Senate GOP's report on Biden was\u00a0rooted in a known Russian disinformation effort intended to spur investigations into false allegations of corruption. HOUSE DEMOCRATS POISED TO EXPAND MAJORITY, AS REPUBLICANS WARN AGAINST AOC TAKEOVER Peters said in September -- prior to the more\u00a0recent\u00a0New York Post Hunter Biden laptop revelations -- that Johnson divided the committee during the coronavirus crisis and used\u00a0taxpayer resources to generate \"a partisan, political report that is rooted in Russian disinformation and intended to influence the presidential election.\" In this combination of 2018 and 2019 file photos are, from left, Democratic U.S. Sen.

Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve Peters joined the U.S. Navy Reserve at age 34 and served from 1993-2000,\u00a0attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he volunteered again for drilling status and served until 2005. 5) Peters was a big supporter of\u00a0the 2008 auto rescue Peters, then a congressman, backed the Obama Administration's 2008 federal rescue of General Motors and Chrysler that helped the Detroit automakers regain their footing. Former President Obama highlighted that auto support in a campaign ad he cut for Peters:\u00a0\"When you\u2019re president, you learn real fast who has your back, and in Michigan that was always Gary Peters,\" Obama says in the ad. \"Gary was there every step of the way. Helping save the auto industry, protecting the Great Lakes, covering pre-existing conditions.\" 'NERVOUS' SCHUMER SPENDING BIG IN MICHIGAN SENATE RACE TO HELP GARY PETERS: MEMO 6) He was the first sitting senator to publicly share a personal experience with abortion In an interview with Elle magazine in October, Peters revealed a very personal story about his\u00a0first wife\u00a0struggling to get\u00a0access to an\u00a0abortion\u00a0to save her life in the late 1980s.\u00a0Peters said he spoke up during the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court confirmation\u00a0because he was alarmed by the threat she could pose to women\u2019s reproductive rights. Peters voted against Barrett and President Trump's other two Supreme Court nominees. Peters later married his wife, Colleen, and they have three children. 7) He's campaigning as a 'workhorse'\u00a0of the Senate, not as a showhorse Peters has embraced his unflashy persona. He says he didn't get into politics to be on TV and he hopes Michiganders will appreciate someone who just rolls up their sleeves and gets work done. In one Peters'\u00a0campaign ad, a Michigan craft brewer Chris Andrus describes how\u00a0Peters helped him cut through red tape to expand the\u00a0Mitten Brewing Company. \"I don't think the senator is focused on flash,\" Andrus says. \"I think he's focused on substance.\" Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

            "article_content": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies at age 87. Ruth Bader Ginsburg served on the bench of the highest court for over two decades before she passed away Friday from\u00a0complications of\u00a0cancer. She became the second woman appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton after a career defined by fighting for women's reproductive\u00a0rights, gender equality and other progressive causes. Prior to becoming a judge, she worked as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and as its General Counsel from 1973\u20131980. Over her years on the bench, she's been part of some notable rulings. Below is a list of five that includes: United States v. Virginia Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion that ended single-sex admission at the Virginia Military Institute. The school argued that women were not suited to train at the academy or endure its education model. Furthermore, it argued that its exclusive admissions policy was in line with other educational institutions in the state. It cited\u00a0Mary Baldwin University, a women's liberal arts college. The United States filed a lawsuit against the policy, saying it violated the 14th Amendment, which confers citizenship upon anyone born in the U.S. \u201cNeither the goal of producing citizen soldiers nor VMI\u2019s implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women,\u201d Ginsburg\u00a0wrote.\u00a0\"Surely that goal is great enough to accommodate women, who today count as citizens in our American democracy equal in stature to men.\" Stenberg v. Carhart Ginsburg cited Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey to argue that a Nebraska law banning partial birth abortion\u00a0did not seek to protect the lives of women as it was written. Under the law, doctors could lose their medical license\u00a0for performing the procedure if done so without regard to the health of the expecting mother. In 2000, the court struck down the law after finding it violated due process. \"A state regulation that 'has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus, violates the Constitution,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"Such an obstacle exists if the State stops a woman from choosing the procedure her doctor reasonably believes will best protect the woman in [the] exercise of [her] constitutional liberty.\" Bush v. Gore The court decision to end a manual recount of ballots in Florida to decide the outcome of the 2000 presidential election effectively handed the presidency to George W. Bush. The Bush campaign had filed an application to halt a recount while the campaign for Vice President\u00a0Al Gore sought to keep it going. Ginsburg famously wrote \"I dissent\" in remarks to argue her objection to the decision. The phrase was an apparent departure from the tradition of using the term \"respectfully.\" Safford Unified School District v. Redding The Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment rights of a 13-year-old girl were violated when Arizona school officials subjected her to a strip search. In 2003, an assistant principal at Safford Middle School in Safford, Ariz., instructed the girl to remove her outer clothing after another student accused her of handing out prescription and over-the-counter medication. A search of her belongings found nothing. In her opinion, Ginsburg called the treatment of the girl \"abusive\" and said it was \"not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it.\" In an interview with USA Today, she expressed frustration with her male colleagues who minimized the girl's experience. \"They have never been a 13-year-old girl,\" she said. \"It's a very sensitive age for a girl. I didn't think that my colleagues, some of them, quite understood.\" Ledbetter V. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company In 2007, the court ruled 5-4 in favor of\u00a0the tire giant after a female employee claimed she was paid less than her male counterparts. Lilly Ledbetter attributed the pay disparity to her gender, which violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act, she argued. Goodyear argued that claims of discrimination should be filed within 180 days of the alleged violation, which had not occurred, meaning Ledbetter could only legally claim 180 days of pay discrimination rather than her\u00a0nearly two decades of her employment with the company. In her dissenting opinion, Ginsburg highlighted the issue of pay disparity over long periods of time. \"Pay disparities often occur, as they did in Ledbetter\u2019s case, in small increments; cause to suspect that discrimination is at work develops only over time,\" she wrote. \"Comparative pay information, moreover, is often hidden from the employee\u2019s view. Employers may keep under wraps the pay differentials maintained among supervisors, no less the reasons for those differentials. \"Her initial readiness to give her employer the benefit of the doubt should not preclude her from later challenging the then current and continuing payment of a wage depressed on account of her sex,\" she continued.",

            "article_content": " After President Trump\u2019s constant interruptions, refusal to answer questions and disregard of all rules at his presidential debate with Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden Sept. 29, most Americans are looking for a substantive debate Wednesday night between vice-presidential candidates. As a liberal Democrat, here are eight things I would like to see in the debate between Republican Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris of California. I think many conservatives would agree with some things on this list as well. 1. An adult debate We have a right to expect candidates for political office to act like adults, not squabbling children. That means politely listening to your opponent without interrupting, refraining from personal insults, and answering rather than ignoring questions that are asked. RICHARD FOWLER: AT VP DEBATE, CORONAVIRUS SHOULD BE TOP ISSUE \u2014 PENCE MUST ANSWER FOR OVER 210,000 DEATHS 2. A display of leadership Eight vice presidents have suddenly become president when the president has died in office. In addition, Vice President Gerald Ford became president when President Richard Nixon resigned. So we need to see candidates for our nation\u2019s second-highest office display the leadership qualities they would need as our president. 3. A fact-based debate President Trump and his campaign have said Biden and Harris are socialists who would destroy our economy, destroy our energy infrastructure, massively raise taxes on just about everyone, send unemployment soaring, sell our country out to China, and turn the American Dream into a nightmare. These wild charges are absurd and not based on reality. Asking Trump and Pence how to unite America is like asking two arsonists how to fight fires. They are a major cause of our disunity. But still, Pence should be asked how to undo the damage he and Trump have done. Obviously, a debate requires disagreeing with and criticizing your opponent, but candidates need to be truthful when doing so. 4. A discussion of law and order, but systemic racism as well Donald Trump and Mike Pence are now in the White House, but they are blaming Biden and Harris for protests against racial injustice that have sometimes turned violent in cities around the country. This is in keeping with Trump\u2019s claims that he is never responsible when things go wrong but deserves all the credit when things go right. In a truthful debate, Pence will have to stop claiming that Biden and Harris are the enemies of police and the friends of criminals, rioters and anarchists. This is nonsense. Both Democrats have come out strongly against violence, looting and arson at protests. Harris is a former prosecutor and Biden authored a major anti-crime bill that was signed into law when he was in the Senate. In fact, both have been criticized by some as being too tough on crime. The real question in the debate should be which ticket can stop violent protests while also bringing about racial reconciliation, ending systemic racism, and ensuring needed police reforms. 5. Defending their records It\u2019s perfectly appropriate for Pence to have to defend actions by him and Trump, and for Harris to defend actions by her and Biden. Ducking questions and evading responsibility is unacceptable. For either candidate to claim they have never made a mistake or done anything wrong is absurd. 6. Protecting Americans from COVID-19 and reviving our economy All of our lives have been disrupted by the raging coronavirus pandemic. Tragically, the virus has killed more than 210,000 Americans and infected more than 7.4 million people in our country, including President Trump and a growing list of staffers in his White House and on his presidential campaign. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and face financial disaster, many business have closed permanently, millions of children can\u2019t attend school, and we are all tired of social distancing and wearing masks. Harris will be fully justified to attack Pence for the Trump administration\u2019s incompetent response to the pandemic. He is, after all, the official who Trump put in charge of the response to the disease COVID-19. And Pence will be fully justified in asking Harris how she and Biden would do a better job and criticizing aspects of their plan. But above all, Americans want to know where we go from here. What safeguards will be in place to ensure a coronavirus vaccine and treatments are safe and effective and made available to everyone? What can be done in the meantime to halt the spread of the virus? How can we revive our economy without endangering public health? What assistance can we make available to people who have lost their jobs and businesses due to the pandemic? While Trump likes to brag about the strong economy Americans enjoyed before the pandemic hit, that doesn\u2019t help people out of work and out of money today. Both candidates need to be asked these and more questions on the health and economic devastation caused by COVID-19 because this is the top issue on the minds of voters right now. 7. Uniting Americans Some historians have told us that Americans are now more divided than at any time since the Civil War. President Trump has worsened these divisions, regularly demonizing and insulting his critics and sometimes calling them unpatriotic and criminal. Asking Trump and Pence how to unite America is like asking two arsonists how to fight fires. They are a major cause of our disunity. But still, Pence should be asked how to undo the damage he and Trump have done. Harris should be asked to give specifics and what a Biden-Harris administration would do to heal the divisions sowed by Trump and Pence. 8. Talk about themselves Finally, both candidates should give us a better idea of who they are, what has influenced them, and what they want to accomplish in office. While some of us follow politics closely and know a lot about Pence and Harris, millions of Americans don\u2019t. The debate should help us all get to know each candidate a bit better. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Years ago, when my dad was still alive, he used to tell me to use everything I had in my arsenal to my advantage whether in an interview, a debate, or another situation. There are two areas where Harris trumps Pence. She is both a woman and a person of color. She can speak to women\u2019s issues such as reproductive rights and issues such as racial injustice from a personal perspective \u2014 something a White man like Pence just can\u2019t do. At the same time, Pence can talk about how his religious convictions motivate him to want to help others and how experiences in his life put him in the best position to serve the American people as vice president for another four years. The bottom line is that as long as the debate doesn\u2019t devolve into a shouting match, as happened with the Trump-Biden debate last week, it could be exciting, informative and consequential. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Each candidate has a responsibility to give truthful answers, stick to the facts, and explain why he or she should be the second-most powerful leader of our country, ready to step into the presidency if needed. Will they? We\u2019ll soon know. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM LESLIE MARSHALL",

            "article_content": "First lady Melania Trump wraps the second night of the 2020 Republican National Convention. On night two of the Republican National Convention, Democrats tore\u00a0into President Trump for his response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 highlighting the record number of jobs lost amid the outbreak and accusing Trump of directing federal funds to major corporations instead of American workers. While many of the speakers at the convention generally avoided addressing the pandemic on Tuesday \u2013 focusing instead on issues ranging from abortion to immigration to the economy \u2013 Democrats have made the virus front and center in their reactions to convention. \u201cMore than 16 million Americans are out of work \u2014 that\u2019s one in ten workers,\u201d the party tweeted Tuesday evening. \u201cInstead of providing relief, Trump and the GOP have delayed relief and continue to push for eliminating health coverage for 20 million Americans.\u201d Democrats added in another tweet that \u201c[a]s American families struggled to retain employment and stay safe during this pandemic, Trump directed aid to big corporations. This president isn\u2019t looking out for American families \u2014 he only cares about the wealthiest 1%.\u201d According to the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, a number of major corporations with a market\u00a0capitalization of more than $25 million and more than 600 employees did receive loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses worth $10 million or more. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s RNC is an alternate reality,\u201d Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in a statement after the second night of convention proceedings ended. \u201cIn this delusion, thousands of Americans didn\u2019t die in the last week from COVID-19, nor have millions of Americans been infected or put out of work,\" she said. \"Our economy hasn\u2019t ground to a halt and our kids aren\u2019t being kept home from school. Donald Trump\u2019s continual refusal to take this virus seriously has given the United States the worst outbreak in the world, and his convention\u2019s refusal to come to grips with reality or acknowledge the magnitude of the loss is a stark reminder to Americans of his complete failure to lead.\u201d TRUMP ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF 'USING COVID TO STEAL OUR ELECTION' While most speakers at the RNC on Tuesday shied away from addressing the pandemic, one notable exception was first lady Melania Trump, who in the final address of the evening said she has \u201cbeen moved in the way Americans have come together in such an unfamiliar and frightening situation.\u201d Saying she did not want did not want to get into partisan infighting, she instead talked about \u201cthe beautiful side of humanity\u201d she has observed in the wake of natural disasters around the country, noting that a common thread \u201cis the unwavering resolve to help one another.\u201d Despite the first lady\u2019s more optimistic tone to close night two of the RNC, Democrats hit the GOP once again for sowing \u201cfear and division\u201d during the convention. \u201cThe GOP promised optimism, but like the past four years of Trump\u2019s leadership, they delivered nothing but fear and division,\u201d the party tweeted. \u201cWe need a president that will put an end to this darkness and unite our country.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tom Perez, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, attacked the Trump administration for its hardline policies toward illegal immigration shortly after a segment of the convention highlighting legal immigration that featured Trump carrying out a naturalization ceremony at the White House. \u201cTrump has separated families, put kids in cages, attacked DACA, and paints immigrants as criminals while thousands of families wait on the border for asylum,\u201d Perez tweeted. \u201cHe continually attacks immigrants, and no convention stunt will change that.\u201d Biden\u2019s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, went after the RNC\u2019s pro-life agenda following a speech by Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director and \"employee of the year\u201d who has come out against abortion and endorsed Trump. \u201cAs states across our nation continue to attack reproductive rights, especially abortion, it\u2019s more important than ever we have a president who will defend and expand these rights,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cAs president, [Joe Biden] will codify Roe v. Wade and protect the constitutional right to choose.\u201d During her speech, Johnson described graphically how she saw \"an unborn baby fighting back\" against an ultrasound-guided abortion. \"Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen \u2013 an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction\u00a0... The last thing I saw was a spine twirling around in the mother\u2019s womb before succumbing to the force of the suction,\" she said. Fox News\u2019 Sam Dorman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "University of Maryland professor, Jason Nichols, and member of President Trump's 2020 advisory council, Bruce LeVell, weigh in on \u2018Outnumbered Overtime.\u2019 A federal judge is ordering the state of Georgia to provide paper polling books in order to save voters from long lines that might result from the state's current infrastructure. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg's\u00a0order on Monday requires that each polling place have at least one copy of the paper polling books, which are used to check voter registration.\u00a0According to the Associated Press, election integrity advocates brought the suit concerned that the state's automated voting system was less reliable than hand-marked paper ballots. Advocates pressed for Totenberg to order the state abandon its new voting machines, but also proposed the paper pollbooks, arguing that\u00a0malfunctioning electronic versions yielded longer waiting lines in elections earlier this year. In June, The New York Times reported a \"full-scale meltdown\" in the state's new voting systems, which it acquired in 2019 after widespread claims that\u00a0voter suppression affected the 2018 election results.

He said his office and county officials \u201care preparing Georgia for the biggest election turnout in history, and it will do so successfully despite the constant distraction of litigation filed by activists determined to undermine the credibility of our elections.\" Monday's order touched on broader concerns about election fraud before November. According to WSBTV, Raffensperger's office referred at least 24 allegations of voter fraud to the\u00a0attorney general. \u201cA fraudulent vote dilutes the power of those voters who follow the rules and undermines the fundamental democratic idea of one person, one vote,\" he reportedly said. \"As Secretary of State, I will investigate any and all attempts to delegitimize elections in Georgia.\u201d Earlier this month that his office found nearly 1,000 cases of double voting in which individuals cast an absentee ballot before voting again in person. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats reportedly accused Raffensperger of trying to spread a conspiracy theory. \u201cIt is clear that rather than do his job of promoting the safety and security of our voting process, the secretary of state is instead pushing the GOP\u2019s voting conspiracy theories and disinformation,\" the state party's executive director said.

            "article_content": "Tezlyn Figaro, former social justice director for the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, and Liz Harrington, RNC National spokesperson, debate. The third night of the Democratic National Convention featured the biggest names yet, highlighted by appearances by new vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former President Barack Obama. Here are five key moments from Wednesday night: HARRIS ACCEPTS HISTORIC VP NOMINATION, SAYS 'THERE IS NO VACCINE FOR RACISM' Harris reflects on the past, looks to the future, blames Trump for the present Harris, the first Black woman to be on a major party ticket, began her speech by looking at those who came before her: those who fought for women to have the right to vote and \"a seat at the table\"; leaders like Obama and Hillary Clinton, and her parents. Much of the second half of her speech was spent praising her running mate Joe Biden, saying that he will \"bring us together\" in battling against the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis\u00a0and racism. In between, Harris\u00a0blamed President Trump for those same problems, claiming that the president's \"failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.\" She noted that COVID-19 disproportionately affects people of color, claiming that this \"is the\u00a0effect of structural racism,\" as well as the effect of \"inequities\" in education,\u00a0technology, health care,\u00a0housing\u00a0and other areas, as well as \"injustice\" in the criminal justice system and reproductive health care. \"This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly how we see each other \u2014 and how we treat each other,\" Harris claimed, stating that the country needs to elect a president \"who will bring something different, something better.\" Later in her speech, she said Trump \"turns our tragedies into political weapons.\" Obama accuses Trump of using office for selfish purposes, Trump fires back immediately Obama did not\u00a0hold back during his speech, claiming that his successor has \"shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends.\u201d He slammed\u00a0Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse of the nation\u2019s economy, arguing that \u201cthe consequences of that failure are severe --\u00a0170,000 Americans dead, millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever.\u201d Trump responded on Twitter as it was happening. \"HE SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GOT CAUGHT,\" the president tweeted midway through Obama's speech, referring to the FBI's investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russia, which has since been revealed to have included misrepresentations in warrant applications in the probe's early stages. Hours before Obama's speech, Trump targeted his predecessor, claiming that the reason he ran in the 2016 election was because Obama performed poorly as president. DNC: TRUMP FIRES BACK AT OBAMA, HARRIS CONVENTION ATTACKS IN ALL-CAPS TWEETSTORM \"President Obama did not do a good job. And the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden, because if they did a good job I wouldn't be here. And probably, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have even run,\" Trump insisted. Warren praises Biden's plans, slams Trump's 'ignorance and incompetence' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one of Biden's primary opponents, gave her full support to the Democratic nominee, using her own reputation for having a plan for everything to say Biden is well prepared to be president. \u201cI love a good plan, and Joe Biden has some really good plans \u2014 plans to bring back union jobs in manufacturing and create new union jobs in clean energy,\u201d Warren said from a classroom in Massachusetts. \u201cPlans to increase Social Security benefits, cancel billions in student loan debt, and make our bankruptcy laws work for families instead of the creditors who cheat them.\u201d WARREN'S KID-BLOCK BACKGROUND SPELLS OUT ALMOST-HIDDEN MESSAGE IN CONVENTION SPEECH Warren then shifted gears to bash Trump for America's woes during the coronavirus pandemic. \"Donald Trump\u2019s ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCOVID-19 was Trump\u2019s biggest test. He failed miserably.\" She added: \u201cThis crisis is bad \u2014 and didn\u2019t have to be this way. This crisis is on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enable him. On November 3, we hold them all accountable.\u201d Pelosi accuses Trump, McConnell of blocking Democratic agenda House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered a brief address at the virtual convention, blaming Republicans like the president for keeping Democrats from achieving their goals related to\u00a0infrastructure,\u00a0the Voting Rights Act, immigration, and other issues. \u201cWho is standing in the way? Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump,\u201d Pelosi\u00a0said. \"We have sent the Senate bills to protect our dreamers, to advance LGBTQ equality, to prevent gun violence, to preserve our planet for future generations, and even more,\" she continued. \"All of this is possible for America. Who is standing in the way? Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.\" Clinton urges people to vote, laments 2016 loss Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in a bitter 2016 race, said she wishes Trump\u00a0\"knew how to be a president.\" She pointed to problems in the country such as the ongoing pandemic and the economy, warning\u00a0that if Trump is re-elected, \u201cthings will get even worse.\u201d In that context, Clinton urged people to vote, saying they should request their mail-in ballots now, vote early,\u00a0get involved, and \"convince everyone you know to vote.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Clinton then underscored the need for Democrats to vote by recalling how she lost to Trump despite winning the national popular vote. \u201cRemember: Joe and Kamala can win 3 million more votes and still lose. Take it from me,\u201d she said. Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, Morgan Phillips, Andrew O'Reilly\u00a0and Megan Henney contributed to this report.",

Health experts in Canada warn that coronavirus-related shutdowns may have resulted in a lack of contraceptives due to condom hoarding, contributing to a potential rise in sexually transmitted diseases. Canadians reportedly bought condoms and contraceptives in bulk before\u00a0entering lockdown, raising fears of a widespread shortage, health officials said. \u201cWe saw a whole bunch of people in the first few weeks stocking up,\u201d Nicole Pasquino, clinical practice director at Options for Sexual Health, an organization in British Columbia that offers free condoms, told Politico in an article published last Tuesday. CORONAVIRUS PROMPTS MICHIGAN HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO LAUNCH FREE CONDOM DELIVERY SERVICE The coronavirus-prompted lockdown measures in the state sparked the idea for the new delivery service. (iStock) \u201cThey were all coming to get condoms, birth control, whatever they need to get, and then we see a little bit of a lull because people are going to stay home. \u2026 I think that mentality of stocking up hit everybody hard -- we saw it with toilet paper,\u201d she said. A\u00a0report\u00a0released on May 8\u00a0by Statistics Canada said sales of items,\u00a0like condoms, contraceptives, and lubricants, soared by 30 percent in the second week of March and by 41 percent in the third week --\u00a0as its citizens were asked to stay home, according to the media company. The agency said those sales figures eventually decreased, which they related to coronavirus-related\u00a0factory shutdowns in Malaysia. They added the shutdowns could limit global condom production and confirm their belief of a possible shortage. CONDOM BRAND RELEASES 'CONSENT PACKS' THAT REQUIRE FOUR HANDS TO OPEN Shelter-in-place orders also impacted access to prevention, testing, and treatment for Canadian citizens\u00a0as\u00a0clinics slashed services and labs were held\u00a0up due to COVID-19 tests. Those disruptions could result in a resurgence in certain STDs, including\u00a0syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, according to health officials. \"They're seeing numbers growing at a rate that is alarming,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Chabot, the director of health promotion for Action Canada for Sexual Health & Rights, said, according to Politico. \"People's needs in terms of sexual and reproductive health are not diminishing during this emergency.

            "article_content": " Beware the puffball \"town halls\" that have been organized by CNN and NBC to help former Vice President Joe Biden's Democratic presidential campaign. As Biden makes a virtue out of having tiny, underpopulated \"campaign events\" for the TV cameras, these provide the fraudulent illusion that\u00a0he is engaging with undecided voters. The questions at these events are toothless and designed to promote answers that impress the audience as being thoughtful and measured. The first words out of NBC anchorman Lester Holt's mouth at the Biden event Monday night were the following: \"Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the town hall Monday night, where we are surrounded by dozens of undecided voters.\" NBC TOWN HALL PANNED AS 'BIDEN INFOMERCIAL': 'UNDECIDED VOTERS' DIDN'T SEEM SO 'UNDECIDED' But listening to the questions disqualifies Holt\u2019s claim. For example, Holt presented Ingrid Gilliam-Alexander as \"undecided but leaning toward Biden.\" She insisted President Trump was \"bullying\" Biden at their debate last week and said: \"I'm worried that it knocked you off your game. How do I know that you're able to forcefully lead this country moving forward when being faced with unforeseen challenges and other bullies?\" Surprise! On her LinkedIn page, Gilliam-Alexander posted a video with the hashtag \"#joebiden2020.\" Or try this Holt introduction: \"Our next one comes from Cassidy Brown in Orlando. Voted for the first time in 2016.\" Brown's question? \"My youngest sister is in high school right now. And I knew whenever I was graduating high school and entering college that I wanted to obtain my degree and start a career before starting a family. Having access to birth control and safe reproductive health care was imperative in making that true for me. So, considering the new Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, what are your particular plans to protect women's reproductive rights in the U.S.?\" That sounds like something from a Planned Parenthood questionnaire, not an undecided voter. Sure enough, on her public Facebook page, Brown reposted a meme in 2019 from the \"VOTEPROCHOICE\" Facebook group showing a protest sign that says: \"You're pro-life until the baby is poor, transgender, black, gay, Mexican, disabled, sick, etc.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This is ironic, since the \"right to choose\" is often reserved for eliminating disabled or sick unborn babies. Or try Michelle Cruz Marrero, presented by Holt as someone who \"used to be a registered Republican but voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\" Cruz Marrero said: \"As a mother of a police officer and the wife of a retired police officer, served 28 years, the term 'defunding the police' is of concern and troubling. ... With that being said, I would like to know what you and your administration's policies in reforming the police \u2014 how those will come about, how \u2014 how they will be best handled to ensure police officer safety and the public citizens' safety as well.\" It turns out that Michelle Cruz Marrero can be easily found on Facebook posting on the \"Cubanos con Biden\" page. She's no undecided voter. After the event, she wrote: \"Biden was eloquent and I hope that this clarified all questions regarding the false narrative of 'defunding the police' and that he seeks to reform the police and make it a better place for all of us to live in.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The valentine continued: \"He is intelligent. He is elegant. He is poised and he has a plan. He does not dismiss COVID and the future of our country rests on this election and a vote for Trump is a vote for insanity. This country needs Biden. We need Biden. ... He will save America and he will restore the country we had before this monster took over.\" The proper description for this NBC event is an infomercial. Holt was selling Joe Biden like Larry King hawks Omega XL diet supplements and Prostagenix prostate pills. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden delivers remarks on his plans to beat COVID-19 and build the economy back in Wilmington, Del. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio on Monday appeared to brush off concerns that weekend celebrations over Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory could contribute to the further spread of the coronavirus. At the mayor\u2019s daily press briefing, a New York Post reporter noted that although many attendees of these celebrations wore masks, many did not abide by social distancing rules \u2013 guidelines that De Blasio has previously urged New Yorkers to follow. NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio giving his daily press briefing in Manhattan on Nov. 9, 2020.\u00a0 (NYC Mayor's Office) Asked whether his administration was concerned that the celebrations would fuel an increase in coronavirus cases, De Blasio said that outdoor gatherings with a mask were less a cause for concern than indoor gatherings without a mask. \u201cThis is really what we\u2019re seeing decisively. Those outdoor gatherings, always something to keep an eye on. But if people keep a mask on and they\u2019re outdoors, we haven\u2019t seen too much ill come of that,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cIncreasingly the concern is, more and more people are indoors, fewer and fewer \u2026 wearing a mask. That\u2019s overwhelming where our concern is.\u201d THESE DEMS BALKED AT A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE UNDER TRUMP. WILL THEY CHANGE THEIR TUNE NOW? De Blasio stopped short of addressing the lack of social distancing that was clearly visible at Biden victory\u00a0celebrations. Over the weekend countless videos emerged online of people in major cities across the nation \u2013 including New York City \u2013 packed shoulder-to-shoulder in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. De Blasio shared selfies with other New Yorkers, wearing masks but not socially distanced in a crowd. People celebrate in Times Square after former Vice President Joe Biden was announced as the winner over President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States. (AP) Earlier in the pandemic, De Blasio announced a smartphone app for residents who wanted to report violations of social distancing to authorities. At the time it was the nation\u2019s largest COVID-19 hotspot. He also imposed fines on violators of up to $500. And in April, De Blasio announced that the NYPD was breaking up the funeral of a Brooklyn rabbi that attracted hundreds. De Blasio's office has not returned calls by Fox News seeking comment. CALIFORNIA SEES SPIKE IN COVID CASES DAYS AFTER BIDEN CELEBRATIONS AS US HITS THE 10M MARK The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people to use social distancing and limit physical contact both indoors and outdoors. Guidelines on its website encourage people to \u201cmaintain a distance of at least 6 feet or more from people who don\u2019t live in your household\u201d and to \u201cbe particularly mindful in areas where it may (be) harder to keep this distance, such as check-in areas, parking lots, and routes of entry and exit.\u201d Asked Monday to comment on the apparent double standard, De Blasio again appeared to pivot, reiterating his point that not wearing a mask indoors is cause for greater concern. \u201cI think everyone needs to be careful all the time, and particularly \u2026 if these numbers we\u2019re reporting today continue to grow, the people are going to have to get used to more and more restrictions and going back to some of the ways we had to live in the spring,\u201d De Blasio said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other city leaders like De Blasio have also called for residents to exercise precaution while celebrating Biden's victory. On Sunday, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser encouraged those who voted in the 2020 presidential election to get tested for COVID-19, but was quiet on the thousands of Americans participating in celebrations. The irony was not lost on Gabriel Sterling, a Georgia election offical who during a Monday press conference took a jab at the double standard among\u00a0Biden supporters, quipping:\u00a0\"They're ecstatic. They're in the streets partying. I guess COVID's over.\" Bradford Betz is a Fox News Digital breaking reporter covering crime, political issues, and much more.",

A campaign to stop pregnancy-related\u00a0deaths was recently launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The \"Hear Her\"\u00a0campaign brings\u00a0awareness to pregnancy-related deaths while providing education and encouragement to pregnant and postpartum women. Health officials state that early recognition of warning symptoms and early diagnosis of life-threatening conditions can save lives. Hear Her\u00a0seeks to shed light on warning signs of potentially life-threatening conditions during pregnancy and the year after giving birth by featuring personal stories from women from different backgrounds who experienced severe pregnancy-related complications, according to a press release. The goal is to get women to speak up when they feel something is wrong and to encourage their support systems to listen and act when the expectant mother has concerns. Some of those warning signs are listed here on the CDC website. \u201cListening and taking seriously the concerns of pregnant and postpartum women is a simple, yet powerful action that can save lives,\u201d Wanda Barfield,\u00a0director of CDC\u2019s Division of Reproductive Health at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, stated on the website. \u201cWomen know their bodies and can often tell when something is not right. We hope Hear Her will help people recognize maternal warning signs and quickly get the care women need.\u201d \u201cPregnancy and childbirth should not place a mother\u2019s life in jeopardy, yet in far too many instances, women are dying from complications,\u201d CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, MD stated in the news release. (iStock) MARIJUANA USE DURING PREGNANCY ASSOCIATED WITH AUTISM IN BABIES, STUDY FINDS The CDC said on its website that nearly 700 women die each year in the United States as a result of complications due to pregnancy.\u00a0Black women and American Indian/Alaska Native women are two to three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related issue\u00a0than white women and 2 out of 3 of these deaths can be prevented, the federal agency stated. \u201cPregnancy and childbirth should not place a mother\u2019s life in jeopardy, yet in far too many instances, women are dying from complications,\u201d CDC Director Robert R. Redfield\u00a0stated in the news release. \u201cThis seminal campaign is intended to disrupt the too-familiar pattern of preventable maternal mortality and encourage everyone in a woman\u2019s life to be attentive and supportive of her health during this important time.\u201d TEXAS DOCTOR DELIVERS WOMAN'S BABY 25 YEARS AFTER DELIVERING HER Health officials encourage pregnant women or those who were pregnant within the last year and feel something is not right, to have a conversation with their health care provider, and if an expectant mother or postpartum mother notices one of the urgent maternal warning signs, to seek immediate medical care and continue to share their concerns until they feel they are heard and their questions are addressed. Dr. Maureen G. Phipps,\u00a0the executive officer of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told Fox News the Hear Her campaign will not only empower women but it will encourage those supporting them to be more attentive. \u201cIt encourages clinicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists, to make sure that they listen,\u201d Phips added.\u00a0\u201cThe maternal mortality crisis requires collaboration from everyone - and that means making our patients a valued voice in every conversation: throughout the prenatal period, during labor and delivery, and in the year after birth. As obstetrician-gynecologists, our goal is to provide patient-centered respectful care and for every birth to result in a healthy mom and a healthy baby, and listening to our patients is critical to achieving this goal.\"",

The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s internal watchdog launched an investigation into a whistleblower complaint alleging that an outside doctor performed \u201cmass hysterectomies\u201d on immigrant women held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody at a Georgia detention facility. The Office of the Inspector General, which provides independent oversight and accountability within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has opened an investigation into the allegations presented in a whistleblower\u2019s complaint from a former nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Ga. GEORGIA PRISON WITH ICE DETAINEES PERFORMS QUESTIONABLE HYSTERECTOMIES, SHREDS CORONAVIRUS RECORDS: NURSE Dawn Wooten, a licensed practical nurse, alleged in the 27-page complaint filed by Project South and Government Accountability Project Monday that immigrant women referred to one unnamed doctor outside the facility for additional medical care were receiving a \u201chigh rate of hysterectomies.\u201d Though Wooten did not appear to observe the procedures herself, she testified in the complaint that a number of immigrant women told her they underwent surgery without fully understanding why. ICE said in a statement that only two immigrants held at the Irwin County Detention Center\u00a0have been referred to an outside gynecologist for hysterectomies since 2018. \u201cThe accusations will be fully investigated by an independent office, however, ICE vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures,\u201d Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps, said in a statement, according to The Wall Street Journal. The doctor was not mentioned by name in the complaint, but his lawyer, Scott Grubman, identified him as Dr. Mahendra Amin and vehemently denied the claims. \u201cWe look forward to all of the facts coming out and are confident that, once they do, Dr. Amin will be cleared of any wrongdoing,\u201d Grubman said in a statement.\u00a0In 2015, the Justice Department launched an investigation into Amin and another doctor for allegedly making false claims to Medicaid and Medicare;\u00a0they both paid $525,000 in a civil settlement. GOP SENATORS LAUNCH PROBE INTO FAILURE TO DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF KILLING MOTORCYCLISTS DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli told the National Review\u00a0in an interview on Wednesday that he has asked the Office of Inspector General to expedite the ongoing review into the allegations. He also said he will send three DHS staff members \u2013\u00a0an audit team made up of a Coast Guard doctor, a medical nurse from the deputy secretary\u2019s office, and a lawyer from the general counsel\u2019s office \u2013 to conduct a parallel investigation into the medical records at the facility. \u201cParticularly on the medical side, if any of the allegations were true, we\u2019d be very concerned to correct them as quickly as possible,\u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cI want to be clear that we don\u2019t assume that a complaint is either accurate or inaccurate right out of the box, so we immediately started checking based on the allegations.\u201d The investigations come amid new calls to #AbolishICE and as congressional Democrats make comparisons between present-day ICE and the past eugenic-sterilization laws in the U.S., as well as medical atrocities committed at\u00a0concentration camps in Nazi Germany. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2013 the highest-ranking Democrats in Congress \u2013 both called on the DHS Inspector General to immediately launch an investigation into the claims made in the whistleblower report. \u201cThe horrific conditions described at ICE facilities in the latest DHS whistleblower complaint hearken back to similar atrocities that the entire world committed to never let happen again,\" Schumer said at a press conference.\u00a0\"As any student of history knows, brutal dictators, nationalists have used forced hysterectomies to oppress, punish, and erase marginal populations for centuries. This has no place, no place in any society \u2013 much less at the hands of the United States government.\u201d THREE IMMIGRANT BROTHERS ACCUSED OF RAPING 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN LOUISIANA, ONE SUSPECT FLED In a letter addressed to DHS Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari on Tuesday, Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Judy Chu, Jerrold Nadler\u00a0and Zoe Lofgren led 173\u00a0members of Congress in\u00a0demanding\u00a0the agency provide an update on the status of the investigation by Sept. 25. Citing the initial complaint, the letter reiterated that one unnamed detained immigrant alleged she knew five women who had hysterectomies within a three-month period between October and December 2019 and likened the facility to an \u201cexperimental concentration camp.\u201d Wooten was also quoted as having said that hysterectomies were that doctor\u2019s \u201cspecialty, he\u2019s the uterus collector\u201d and raised questions about proper informed consent for Spanish-speaking detained women. \u201cThese reports hearken back to a dark time in U.S. history in which 32 states passed eugenic-sterilization laws, resulting in the sterilization of between 60 and 70 thousand people in the early 1900s,\" the letter said, adding that\u00a0nearly 150 incarcerated women in California prisons were sterilized between 2006 and 2010 and, in Georgia,\u00a03,284 people had been sterilized by the end of 1963. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This shameful history of sterilization in the United States, in particular sterilization of people of color and incarcerated people, must never be repeated,\" the letter\u00a0continued. \"Yet, the similarities to the accounts of immigrant women and nurses in the Irwin County Detention Center today are eerily similar.\u201d",

Microbes on a male\u2019s penis may be playing a role in the transmission of bacterial vaginosis (BV), according to a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology. The researchers found that not only was the bacteria related to BV found in the microbes of male penises, but its\u00a0presence also was a high predictor of a female sex partner having the infection. HEALTH CARE WORKERS WITH CORONAVIRUS GRAPPLE WITH EMOTIONAL TOLL OF DISEASE: 'THERE IS A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS' BV affects nearly 30% of women ages 14-49 and is the most common infection\u00a0in women 15-44. The infection develops when an imbalance of the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201charmful\u201d bacteria normally present occurs in the female\u2019s vagina, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). If a pregnant woman is infected,\u00a0it can cause premature labor or low birth rates. Women with BV are also at higher risk for contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, both of\u00a0which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. Health experts say the risk for bacterial vaginosis\u00a0can occur when there is a new sex partner or multiple partners, or with hygiene practices like douching. The CDC says symptomatic females may complain of pain, itching\u00a0or burning in or around the vagina, burning during urination, and\u00a0a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex. Recurrence is also a common complaint, health experts told Fox News. \u201cI was in and out of the gynecologist\u2019s office every two to three months,\" Mary, one patient who has suffered from BV, told Fox News. She asked for her last name to be withheld for privacy reasons. The researchers found that not only was the bacteria related to BV found in the microbes of male penises, but its\u00a0presence also was a high predictor of a female sex partner having the infection. (iStock) \u201cIt became frustrating to suffer from this pain and irritation. I tried different treatments, including Metrogel, even boric acid suppositories, [but] nothing seemed to make it ever go away. I asked my doctor if it could be transmitted between my partner and me and if he could be treated. She said there was no real proof that treating my partner would be effective.\u201d The new study could offer hope for women like Mary. \u201cThis study also reminds us that BV is sexually transmissible and may explain why it is difficult to clear with topical and oral antibiotics \u2013\u00a0there is often reinfection or re-inoculation between partners,\"\u00a0Dr. Anna Powell, from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told Fox News. \u201cAs a gynecologist who cares for many women with BV and other vaginitis concerns, I hear the frustration that accompanies this chronic and often relapsing condition. In my own practice I have counseled patients that there is still much we don\u2019t know about sex partner treatment to help relieve the index partner\u2019s symptoms,\" she said. The physician, who is also a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, added: \u201cI would tell them this study certainly provides validation to the idea that both partners are involved, i.e. it\u2019s not just something the female partner is [or] isn\u2019t doing.\u201d \u201cMale sex partner treatment may be a new strategy,\" Dr. Supriya Mehta, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of the study, stated in multiple reports. \"I would like for clinicians, researchers\u00a0and the public to be inclusive of male sex partners in their efforts to improve women's reproductive health,\"\u00a0Mehta added. The study found BV\u00a0occurred in 31% of the 168 couples studied, where the woman did not have BV at baseline, and 37.3% if the man was uncircumcised and 26.3% who were. \u201cBaseline penile microbiota accurately predicted BV incidence in women who did not have BV at baseline, with more than half of incident infections observed at 6\u00a0to 12\u00a0months after penile microbiome assessment. These results suggest interventions to manipulate the penile microbiome may reduce BV incidence in sex partners, and that potential treatment (antibiotic or live biotherapeutic) will need to be effective in reducing or altering bacteria at both the glans/coronal sulcus and urethral sites,\"\u00a0the authors stated. \"While we can\u2019t draw firm conclusions on the exact antibiotic or pro-biotic regimen/duration, this study highlights that, yes, penile skin appears to be a reservoir for the bacteria that are associated with BV in women,\" Powell told Fox News, adding that there were limitations to the study and further research should be done to investigate these new findings. MINNESOTA MOM DIES OF CORONAVIRUS, WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH ON VENTILATOR Mehta told Fox News in an email that a randomized controlled trial is a next step to further study the connection between penis microbes and BV. \"We should investigate whether treating male sex partners of women with BV leads to improved treatment outcomes for women. Our next step is to design a randomized controlled trial to treat male sex partners with antibiotics, to see if this can reduce BV recurrence in female sex partners,\" Mehta\u00a0wrote.",

            "article_content": "Judge Andrew Napolitano analyzes the Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Little Sisters of the Poor in the Obamacare contraceptive case The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday\u00a0that the Trump administration acted within its authority when it expanded exemptions to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) requirement for employers to provide insurance coverage that includes contraception --\u00a0in a victory for\u00a0Little Sisters of the Poor, the Catholic group that has been at the center of the national debate over the mandate. The court ruled 7-2 in favor of the Trump administration and the Catholic charity that cares for the elderly in two related disputes against Pennsylvania, which sued over the validity of a rule from the Trump administration that allowed religiously-affiliated groups and some for-profit companies\u00a0to opt-out\u00a0of providing contraception coverage to employees. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, ruled that the Trump administration's challenged rulemaking was aboveboard, and hailed the work of the Little Sisters of the Poor. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas participates in taking a new family photo with his fellow justices at the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst - RC15CF6608B0 SUPREME COURT RULES RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS SHIELDED FROM TEACHERS' EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS \"For over 150 years, the Little Sisters have engaged in faithful service and sacrifice, motivated by a religious calling to surrender all for the sake of their brother,\" Thomas wrote. \"But for the past seven years, they -- like many other religious objectors who have participated in the litigation and rulemakings leading up to today\u2019s decision --\u00a0have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs.\" He added: \"We hold today that the Departments had the statutory authority to craft that exemption, as well as the contemporaneously issued moral exemption. We further hold that the rules promulgating these exemptions are free from procedural defects.\" Little Sisters of the Poor\u00a0Sister Constance Veit told Shannon Bream on \"Fox News @ Night\" earlier this year that following the ACA mandate was \"unthinkable.\" \"We dedicate our lives to this because we believe in the dignity of every human life at every stage of life from conception until natural death,\" Veit said. \"So, we've devoted our lives -- by religious vows -- to caring for the elderly. And, we literally are by their bedside holding their hand as they pass on to eternal life. So, it's unthinkable for us, on the one way, to be holding the hand of the dying elderly, and on the other hand, to possibly be facilitating the taking of innocent unborn life.\" The Supreme Court also ruled in favor of religious organizations in an employment discrimination case Wednesday. And last week it came down with a ruling that states could not ban religious schools from receiving money from state-funded scholarship programs that are available to non-religious private schools. Lower court rulings had gone against the administration, with a nationwide injunction putting the exemptions on hold. But the Supreme Court's ruling Wednesday amounts to a huge win for religious conservatives who have been battling the ACA's contraceptive mandate for years. \"It is outrageous that the Obama administration forced a group of nuns to violate their religious beliefs in the first place,\" Judicial Crisis Network Vice President and Senior Counsel Frank Scaturro tweeted. \"The Court\u2019s decision today upholding that exemption is a victory for freedom of religion and conscience\u2014for the Little Sisters and for everyone. Let\u2019s be thankful that the Little Sisters\u2019 ordeal in court has finally ended.\" CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS INJURED HEAD IN FALL LAST MONTH, WAS HOSPITALIZED Thomas was joined in his judgment\u00a0by all the justices except for Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Wednesday. Ginsburg raised alarms in her dissent that the ruling\u00a0could put women's health at risk. \"Today, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree,\" she wrote. \"Destructive of the Women\u2019s Health Amendment, this Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer\u2019s insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets.\" There were two concurring opinions, one written by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, and another written by Justice Elena Kagan and joined by Justice Stephen Breyer. In her opinion, Kagan said that she believed the Trump administration had the authority to make the religious exemption to the contraceptive mandate, but that she is suspicious about whether the administration fulfilled \"administrative law\u2019s demand for reasoned decisionmaking.\" Loraine Marie Maguire (3rd R), mother provincial of the Little Sisters of the Poor, stands alongside fellow nuns following oral arguments in 7 cases dealing with religious organizations that want to ban contraceptives from their health insurance policies on religious grounds at the Supreme Court in Washington, DC, March 23, 2016. ((SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)) LITTLE SISTER OF THE POOR ON DEFYING OBAMACARE MANDATE: 'WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF EVERY HUMAN LIFE' Kagan argues that Pennsylvania could further challenge the religious exemption as \"arbitrary and capricious\" in lower courts following Wednesday's ruling -- something that the lower courts did not previously rule on because they had decided that the rule was outside of the administration's authority. Alito's concurrence, on the other hand, argues that Thomas' ruling did not go far enough and that the court should have ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) requires the religious exemption. \"We now send these cases back to the lower courts, where the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey are all but certain to pursue their argument that the current rule is flawed on yet another ground, namely, that it is arbitrary and capricious and thus violates the APA,\" Alito wrote. He added: \"If RFRA requires this exemption, the Departments did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in granting it. And in my judgment, RFRA compels an exemption for the Little Sisters and any other employer with a similar objection to what has been called the accommodation to the contraceptive mandate.\" SMITH AND VON SPAKOVSKY: SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON 'FAITHLESS' ELECTORS IS A VICTORY FOR WE THE PEOPLE Liberal groups were incensed by the Wednesday decision, which they said was essentially a license to discriminate. \"This is a shameful decision from the Supreme Court,\" Bridgitte Amiri, the deputy director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, said. \"Religious liberty is a fundamental right, but it does not grant a license to discriminate. Denying employees and students coverage for birth control will limit their ability to decide whether and when to have a family and make other decisions about their\u00a0futures. And it will exacerbate existing inequalities, falling hardest on people with the fewest resources and people of color.\" Amiri noted that the religious exemption is just that -- an exemption. And most employers will still have to provide birth control in their health care plans under the ACA. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But pro-life groups nonetheless carried the day, and Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, credited President Trump. \"Today is a major victory for President Trump, who has courageously fought to protect the Little Sisters of the Poor from the Obama-Biden HHS abortifacient mandate,\" she said. \"We commend President Trump for standing strong for the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2013 his record stands in stark contrast to that of Joe Biden, who helped launch this assault as Obama\u2019s Vice President nearly a decade ago.\" The justices this fall will hear a broader challenge to Obamacare, and requests by the current administration and some red-leaning states to invalidate the entire Affordable\u00a0Care Act. It is a move opposed by the Democratic-led House and a coalition of other states. Fox News' Bill Mears and Julia Musto contributed to this report.",

President Trump\u2019s pick for the\u00a0Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is set to begin confirmations Monday after being nominated for the seat last held by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Here are five things to know about\u00a0Barrett, the\u00a07th Circuit Court of Appeals judge: She\u2019s a mother of seven Barrett, 48, was born and raised in New Orleans and was the oldest of seven children. She now has seven children with her husband Jesse, whom she met at Notre Dame law school. Two of their children were\u00a0adopted in Haiti. Her youngest child has Down Syndrome. Barrett\u2019s husband Jesse and she debated for years whether one parent should stay home to raise the children, and she has described \"soul-searching and anxiety about balancing kids and work.\u201d Jesse\u2019s aunt has helped watch the kids for years and Jesse, who formerly worked as a federal prosecutor and now works in private practice, took on more of the duties at home when Barrett became a judge. FLASHBACK: AMY CONEY BARRETT PRESSED BY DEMS IN 2017 HEARING OVER CATHOLIC FAITH Her Catholic faith has become a point of contention Barrett's devout Catholic faith has been the target of Democrats, even before her name was floated to\u00a0succeed Ginsburg on the court. In December 2017,\u00a0when she was appointed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett had to assert numerous times that her faith would not influence her jurisprudence.\u00a0\u201cWhy is it that so many of us on this side have this very uncomfortable feeling that dogma and law are two different things, and I think whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\u00a0ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Barrett. \u201cAnd I think in your case, professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you. And that\u2019s of concern.\u201d The senator told Barrett she was a \u201ccontroversial\u201d nominee, \u201cbecause you have a long history of believing that your religious beliefs should prevail\u201d over the law. AMY CONEY BARRETT'S FRIENDS PRAISE HER AS 'FAIR,' 'A POWERHOUSE' \u201cYou\u2019re controversial because many of us that have lived our lives as women really recognize the value of finally being able to control our reproductive systems,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Roe entered into that, obviously.\u201d She clerked for Antonin Scalia Barrett's judicial philosophy is often likened to that of her former boss, and her scholarship focuses on originalism. She has spoken and written praise of Scalia's close attention to the text of statutes. Her ties to Scalia coupled with her Catholic faith have drawn the ire of abortion rights advocates. Scalia railed against the Supreme Court's rulings on abortion. Barrett has asserted she would have \"no opportunity\" to overturn previous abortion rulings such as Roe v. Wade. \u201cThere would be no opportunity for me to be a no vote on Roe,\u201d Barrett responded. \u201cAnd I would faithfully apply all Supreme Court precedent.\u201d \"It's never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law,\u201d she added. She teaches at Notre Dame Law Barrett graduated first in her class from Notre Dame Law in 1997. She served as a visiting professor at George Washington University Law School before returning to her alma mater in 2002. At Notre Dame, she's been named \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" three times and has taught\u00a0Constitutional Law, Civil Procedure, Evidence, Federal Courts, Constitutional Theory Seminar and Statutory Interpretation Seminar. She continues to teach seminars as a sitting judge. Her academic work\u00a0focuses on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and\u00a0stare decisis.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Sorry, lovers: Survivors of the novel coronavirus should wait at least 30 days before having sex again \u2014 according to an official\u00a0in Thailand, at least. Veerawat Manosutthi, a senior medical expert at the Thai Disease Control Department, advised the 30-day hold-off and also implored men to use a condom after that time, according to the Thai news outlet Khaosod English. CORONAVIRUS FOUND IN SEMEN OF MALE CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS, CHINESE RESEARCHERS SAY In making the recommendation, the official referenced a recent study by Chinese researchers\u00a0that discovered the novel virus in the semen of infected male individuals, ultimately raising the prospect that the virus could potentially be sexually transmitted.\u00a0The study, conducted at China\u2019s Shangqiu Municipal Hospital, was described in a research letter published earlier this month by the JAMA Network of medical journals and is the first to detect the virus in reproductive fluids. Chinese researchers said semen from six out of 38 coronavirus survivors tested positive for the virus. According to the paper's abstract, four out of the six individuals were in \u201cthe acute stage of infection\u201d at the time of semen collection, and the remaining two \u201chad achieved clinical recovery.\" The Thai official also advised using a condom after the 30 day period.

It did not explain how much viral load was present in the sperm, nor did it examine whether or not the virus could be transmitted through sexual activity. Further study is needed to understand whether safe-sex practices should be part of COVID-19 prevention efforts, according to medical experts who read the paper. \u201cThese are intriguing results,\u201d John Brooks, chief medical officer for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC's) coronavirus response, told The Wall Street Journal. But it doesn\u2019t mean that semen is infectious, he said. VITAMIN D LEVELS MAY IMPACT COVID-19 MORTALITY, STUDY CLAIMS \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking everywhere for this virus, we\u2019re finding its footprints in different places in the body -- whether that\u2019s a trace or if it\u2019s a big foot is very hard to say.\u201d In addition to abstaining from sex, the Thai medical expert also advised survivors to hold off from kissing for the same amount of time, as the coronavirus mainly spreads from person-to-person through infectious respiratory droplets. Fox News's Christopher Carbone contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ford is bringing back the Bronco as a lineup of SUVs aimed at off-road and outdoors enthusiasts. Who is John Bronco? As the story goes, he was the greatest pitchman who ever lived and the inspiration for the Ford Bronco name. That story being a mockumentary teased in a new trailer posted to YouTube on Aug. 11, promoting a short film that\u2019s \u201ccoming soon\u201d from Ron Howard and Brian Grazier's Imagine Entertainment. \u201cJohn Bronco\u201d is directed\u00a0by \"Funny or Die\" veteran Jake Szymanski and stars \u201cJustified\u201d and \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d actor Walton Goggins, \"Saturday Night Live\" comic\u00a0Tim Meadows and Bo Derek and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing themselves. A synopsis of the 36-minute film, which is listed as a selection of the canceled 2020 Tribeca Film Festival\u00a0originally set for April, says Ford hired Bronco to race its new \u201cprototype SUV\u201d in the 1966 Baja 1000, then made him the face of the new truck. (Imagine Entertainment) \u201cHis commercials were on every channel and his jingle went triple-platinum. John launched his own cologne, breakfast cereal, video game, action figure, you name it. He was the very embodiment of the American dream that is, until it all came crashing down,\u201d it says. Ford\u2019s relationship to the film is opaque. A spokesman for the automaker said Imagine pitched the story and that Ford\u00a0offered access to its archive to \u201chelp share the story of John Bronco,\u201d but would not confirm or deny if Ford provided funding for the project or if it is part of a coordinated marketing effort. \u201cWe worked with Imagine in several ways to help tell this story.\u201d However, Ford promoted Aug. 11\u00a0as \u201cBronco Day\u201d to commemorate the date\u00a0it was revealed in 1965, a year before John Bronco\u2019s alleged race victory, which never happened because the first Baja 1000 was held in 1967 and a Bronco didn\u2019t win it until 1968. (Care2) The film is accompanied by a website that suggests John Bronco dropped out of the spotlight in 1996 -- when production of the last generation Bronco was discontinued -- and includes photos of sightings of him over the years. It also has a petition to Bring Back John Bronco that's hosted by Care2, which bills itself as \"the world's largest community for good\" and typically focuses on humanitarian and social justice issues that \"fuel the progressive movement,\" but has a section dedicated to media topics. Imagine Entertainment, The Tribeca Film Festival and Care2 have not yet responded to requests for comment. John Bronco-related Instagram and Facebook accounts began making posts in stealth mode earlier this year and only had\u00a0a handful of followers at the time this story was published.
