            "article_content": "In the wake of the election, the Anti-Defamation League \u2014 the national organization devoted to fighting anti-Semitism and bigotry in all forms \u2014 is wasting no time in accelerating its efforts against hate in America. The climate at the organization\u2019s offices post-election is characterized by \u201cexhaustion and energy,\u201d Deborah Lauter, ADL\u2019s senior vice president for policy and programs, told CBS News. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a sense of urgency, more of a sense that we\u2019re more relevant than ever before,\u201d Lauter said. \u201cThe day after, when people were shocked by the result personally, they said, \u2018Thank God I work here because at least I can get hugs from my colleagues.\u2019\u201d The organization \u2014 which conducts large-scale research on hate groups, including the alt-right; partners with law enforcement to better deal with hate crimes; and cultivates public awareness of hate and bigotry, among other campaigns \u2014 has seen an explosion in financial contributions and volunteer interest since Donald Trump\u2019s election. The president-elect won the White House after conducting a campaign critics accused of trafficking in racist and anti-Semitic stereotypes. At various points, Trump called Mexicans \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201crapists;\u201d\u00a0suggested an American-born federal judge could not do his job impartially because of his Mexican heritage; advocated \u201ca total and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims coming to the U.S.; and used imagery lifted from white supremacists and Neo-Nazi online message boards.\u00a0 It was an election that \u201csaw hate move from the fringes and into the mainstream with unprecedented volume and velocity,\u201d the ADL said in a statement after Donald Trump\u2019s win. The ADL joins other prominent nonprofit organizations \u2014 like the American Civil Liberties Union, the investigative journalism site ProPublica, and Planned Parenthood \u2014 who\u2019ve seen dramatic spikes in donations since the election.\u00a0 Contributions to the ADL jumped 50-fold the day after the election, and that level of giving has persisted throughout last week and this week, the group said. About 70 percent of those donations came from first-time donors. Several major donors are also upping their contributions in light of the election, some to six figures.\u00a0 In addition, the group\u2019s 27 regional offices have seen significantly higher call volume \u2014 10 to 20 times what they\u2019d normally receive \u2014 from people asking how they could support the organization\u2019s work combating bigotry, the ADL said. \u201cWe have seen so many instances where we fear and are concerned about the fact that the extremists\u2019 rhetoric has become mainstream,\u201d Lauter said. \u201cThe feeling is one of being disheartened at how easily this can happen. But [we\u2019re] also somewhat energized at how important this work is to rebuild what we thought was the status quo of tolerance in this country.\u201d  The presidential campaign has helped make the organization\u2019s work suddenly seem more relevant to the public discourse than ever before. The group\u2019s first summit on contemporary anti-Semitism, which was scheduled before the election to take place Thursday in New York, rapidly reached capacity at 900 people, defying organizers\u2019 expectations. To address unmet demand, the ADL plans to live-stream the summit, called \u201cNever is Now,\u201d online. The ADL has plans to \u201cquadruple down\u201d on its efforts against hate and bigotry, Lauter said, including working with law enforcement to help head-off the rise in hate crimes. In the past week, the organization has responded to incidents in Wellsville, New York, Philadelphia and Holyoke, Massachusetts, and there have been reports of numerous other flare-ups of bullying, harassment and violence around the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center, another nonprofit dedicated to tracking and fighting hate groups, has collected 437 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment between Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election, and the morning of Nov. 14. The vast majority of these incidents \u2014 collected via news reports, social media and direct submissions \u2014 have targeted immigrants, followed by African-Americans and LGBT Americans, according to the SPLC.\u00a0 The FBI, which collects data on hate crimes, takes time to compile national statistics; on Monday, the agency released 2015 data that showed a 6.7 percent increase in the number of hate crimes reported to police, led largely by a 67 percent surge in crimes against Muslims. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, expressed alarm about what it called the \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of attacks. \u201cWe witnessed a sharp jump in anti-Muslim incidents nationwide last year, with that spike in Islamophobia continuing through 2016 and accelerating after the November 8 election,\u201d CAIR Government Affairs Director Robert McCaw said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThis unprecedented increase in bigotry of all kinds must be repudiated in the strongest terms possible by all our nation\u2019s leaders, beginning with President-elect Donald Trump.\u201d The group also urged the president-elect to cut ties with one of his advisers on national security, Frank Gaffney, whom CAIR describes as an \u201canti-Islam conspiracy theorist\u201d with a \u201clong history of smears and innuendo aimed at Muslims.\u201d\u00a0 Another Trump aide,\u00a0Steve Bannon, became the focus of concern this week when he was named as the new administration\u2019s\u00a0chief strategist. Before becoming\u00a0Trump campaign CEO in August, Bannon was best known for his leadership at Breitbart News, a right-wing media outlet known for inflammatory rhetoric that attracted anti-Semitic, white nationalist, overtly sexist and racist supporters. Headlines that ran on Breitbart while Bannon was in charge include: \u201cBill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew\u201d; \u201cBirth control makes women unattractive and crazy\u201d; \u201cThe solution to online \u2018harassment\u2019 is simple: Women should log off\u201d; and \u201cWould you rather your child had feminism or cancer?\u201d\u00a0 According to 2007 court documents, Bannon\u2019s ex-wife said he resisted sending his daughters to a particular school because of the number of Jews who attended it: \u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t like Jews and that he doesn\u2019t like they raise their kids to be \u2018whiny brats\u2019 and that he didn\u2019t want the girls going to school with Jews,\u201d she claimed. Bannon denied ever making the remark.\u00a0 The Anti-Defamation League took a clear stand against the president-elect\u2019s appointment.  \u201cIt is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the \u2018alt-right\u2019 \u2014 a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists \u2014 is slated to be a senior staff member in the \u2018people\u2019s house,\u2019\u201d ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted Sunday. We at @ADL_National oppose the appt of Steve Bannon to sr role at @WhiteHouse bc he & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values pic.twitter.com/qCVEPKoa7q As of Wednesday, more than 350,000 people have signed the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s petition stating that Steve Bannon has no place in the White House. Meanwhile, 169 members of Congress have signed a letter asking President-elect Trump to rescind the appointment, according to an update from Rep. David Cicilline (D, Rhode Island) Wednesday. BREAKING: Rep Cicilline leads 169 Members of Congress asking @realDonaldTrump to rescind White House appointment of Steve Bannon. pic.twitter.com/QZhZbvYAXs Defending Trump\u2019s pick,\u00a0Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy\u00a0said the president-elect has a right to select whom he wants for his team, and that he should be given \u201cthe benefit of the doubt.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou cannot judge everything that President-elect Trump is doing based on one person,\u201d Rep. McCarthy told CBS News on Monday. For the ADL, the work of making extremist voices unacceptable is integral to the organization\u2019s identity going forward, Lauter explained.  \u201cYou have to stand up to hate. You can\u2019t be a bystander. You have to marginalize extremist voices,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Shanika Gunaratna covers science and technology for CBSNews.com",

            "article_content": "U.S. intelligence sources are not just pointing the finger at Russian hackers, but squarely at the Kremlin for a cyberattack that began in July of 2015 -- more than a year before the presidential election. They now believe Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the cyber interference that first targeted the Democratic National Committee.  Do Americans think Donald Trump will be a good president? A little more than a month before his inauguration, CBS News has asked Americans for their opinions on the pending Trump presidency, his Cabinet picks and the highly contentious issue of his vast business interests and how they could affect his judgement as America\u2019s chief executive. President-elect Donald Trump has named generals to his Cabinet. He\u2019s chosen business leaders and Wall Street executives. But he\u2019s also tapped elected officials; a U.S. senator, two House members and two governors. If they\u2019re all confirmed, someone will have to fill those vacancies, but the rules are different for every position, and many of them also differ by state. After a rocky start that saw ambulances trying to carry civilians out of the tiny opposition enclave come under purported regime fire, Russia\u2019s defense ministry says the evacuation of some 5,000 rebels and civilians from eastern Aleppo is underway. But after a day that saw violence flare, testing the tentative cease-fire, the fate of the hopeful evacuees is far from certain. The coldest air of the season is spreading frigid temperatures south and east across the country, along with some heavy snow. Wind chills are below zero from the Northern Plains to the Great lakes, with some places shivering at more than 20 below. The cold air is fueling lake-effect snow, making roads treacherous. Americans who voted for Donald Trump are often framed as backing him mostly because of their precarious economic status in an era of downward mobility. But new research reveals a far more complex picture. We look at a key segment of higher-income voters who helped tilt the election the real estate mogul\u2019s way. \u00a0 The Federal Reserve has moved to hike interest rates for only the second time in more than a decade. We examine how the housing sector, a major source of wealth for millions of Americans, is likely to be affected by the shift to tighter monetary policy.
