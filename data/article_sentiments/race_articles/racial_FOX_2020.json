            "article_content": "President Trump hits key states as Joe Biden takes day off from trail; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' A new national poll shows Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u00a0retaining a single-digit lead over President Trump \u2013 but the public opinion survey also indicates that slightly more voters think Trump\u00a0will win the presidential election. The Monmouth University survey released on Thursday also suggests that a majority of voters believes there are so-called secret Trump voters in their communities who keep their preference to themselves. BIDEN HOLDS EDGE OVER TRUMP IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN: POLL According to the poll, which was conducted Sept. 3-8, the former vice president and Democratic challenger tops Trump 51%-44% among likely voters\u00a0and holds a slightly wider 51%-42% lead over the president among the wide pool of registered voters. Libertarian Party nominee Jo Jergensen and Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins are each at 2% among registered voters and\u00a01% among likely voters. An average of all the latest national polls in the White House race that was compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates Biden ahead of the president by 7.5 points. The Real Clear Politics average of national polling on this date four years ago showed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by 2.7 points. Clinton led Trump by 3.2 points on the eve of the general election \u2013 and ended up winning the national popular vote by 2%. But Trump narrowly topped Clinton in many of the key battleground states, which helped him trounce her in the all-important Electoral College count to win the White House. BIDEN AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN BATTLEGROUND FLORIDA The new Monmouth poll indicates that about 6 in 10 voters are confident that the November election will be conducted fairly and accurately, but 37% don\u2019t have confidence in how the election will be conducted. The survey indicates that more Biden supporters than Trump backers are confident of the election\u2019s fairness and accuracy. Another finding in the poll:\u00a0by a 48%-43% margin, slightly more voters think Trump rather than Biden will win the presidential election. \u201cOf course, most voters believed that Clinton was going to win four years ago and they accepted the different outcome. But the reasons why voters think Trump will win again suggest that some may not accept this year\u2019s result if he loses,\u201d Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement. Fifty-five percent of those questioned in the survey said they think there are voters in their community who are secretly backing Trump. Only 3 in 10 think that there are secret Biden backers in their community. \u201cLook, we are not asking this question as some backdoor way to tap into a secret Trump vote that the polls are missing. We have plenty of evidence that there was no measurable secret vote in 2016 or this year either. However, voters\u2019 belief that a secret Trump vote does exist is a very real phenomenon we need to acknowledge. If this expected vote does not materialize on Election Day, some Democrats will be pleasantly surprised and some Republicans will be shocked,\u201d Murray said. The Monmouth University poll used live telephone operators to question 758 registered voters nationwide. The survey\u2019s overall sampling error is 3.6 percentage points.",

            "article_content": " Americans went to bed Tuesday night and woke up Wednesday morning not sure who their next president will be as slow returns in key swing states delayed\u00a0results and making it impossible to call the race for either President Trump or\u00a0Joe Biden. With the outcome\u00a0still up in the air, both candidates claimed they had a path to victory -- with Biden urging patience and Trump essentially declaring victory in comments made after 2 a.m. ET. \"We believe we are on track to win this election,\" Biden said in an early morning speech in Delaware. Trump\u00a0declared victory in multiple key battleground states early Wednesday, even though it remained unclear who had the votes to win and\u00a0hinted the\u00a0White House\u00a0would push the Supreme Court to rule over\u00a0disputed ballots. \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said. The president was\u00a0immediately contradicted by Vice President Mike Pence, who did not declare victory but rather said, \"I really believe with all my heart ... that we are on the road to victory and we will make America great again, again.\" Biden, on the other hand, told supporters at\u00a0a drive-in rally:\u00a0\"Your patience is commendable. We knew this was gonna go long ... maybe tomorrow morning, maybe even longer.\" \"I'm optimistic about this outcome,\" the former vice president continued.\u00a0\"Your patience is great.\" The competing comments came as each candidate notched\u00a0wins in a handful of key swing states, the Fox News Decision Desk projected. Meanwhile, protests near the White House at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington remained tense as the country awaited clearer presidential election results. CLICK HERE TO SEE FOX NEWS\u2019 LIVE PROBABILITY DIALS Trump, for his part, was projected to take Texas, Florida, Iowa and Ohio, while Biden was projected to win in Arizona and Minnesota. Michigan and Wisconsin have\u00a0yet to be called, and\u00a0it appeared full results in Pennsylvania would not come in until Wednesday or even later, after a contentious campaign that was rocked by the coronavirus pandemic. The Fox News Decision Desk also had not called North Carolina, Georgia or Nevada for either candidate. But Trump early Wednesday morning\u00a0declared that the fact media organizations had not yet called the election in his favor to be \"a fraud on the American public.\" \"This is an embarrassment to our country,\" Trump said. \"We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\" With several states still counting votes, the Fox News Decision Desk was not projecting winners in those states and therefore was not yet projecting a winner for the presidential election. Trump added Wednesday: \"This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud on our nation ... So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at four o'clock in the morning and add them to the list.\" \"We will win this and as far as I'm concerned we already have won it,\" the president continued, despite the fact that he has not yet won the election. \"The president\u2019s statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect,\" Biden campaign manager\u00a0Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement. \"It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens.\" With polls now closed nationwide, many votes in some states, particularly Pennsylvania, remained to be counted -- not cast -- as the labor-intensive process of counting mail ballots was set to continue into Wednesday and potentially longer. A razor-thin presidential race could spur after-the-buzzer litigation over votes. There has already been litigation in Pennsylvania that some are speculating could lead to a repeat of the 2000 presidential race when the Supreme Court essentially decided the outcome of the Bush-Gore election. All polls in the United States were\u00a0closed as of 1 a.m. ET, and as Tuesday night became Wednesday morning the result of the presidential election was\u00a0far from certain -- with Trump and Biden both approaching the goal of 270 electoral votes. CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS Races were too early to call in battleground states including Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina.\u00a0And in\u00a0the all-important battleground Pennsylvania, there were still vast swaths of votes yet to be counted, indicating there may not be a discernable result in the state until Wednesday\u00a0or later. The race will come down to those states and a handful of others as each candidate hopes he will reach 270 electoral votes, the number necessary to win the presidency, by the time the results are final. The Florida win for Trump was considered necessary for him to reach 270 electoral votes while the win for Biden in Arizona made his path to 270 much clearer -- and the path for Trump significantly more difficult. Ohio, Georgia and North Carolina were considered to be some of the other\u00a0critical states to Trump's path to victory. Meanwhile, states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were among the most important to Biden. Pennsylvania's meaty 20 electoral votes -- which may not be decided for days due to the time-consuming process of counting an unprecedented volume of mail-in votes -- are\u00a0considered by many to be the votes that could put either Trump or Biden over the top. The Fox News Decision Desk projects\u00a0Biden will\u00a0win\u00a0Virginia;\u00a0Vermont;\u00a0Washington, D.C.;\u00a0Delaware;\u00a0Rhode Island;\u00a0Connecticut;\u00a0Illinois;\u00a0Maryland;\u00a0New Jersey; New York; Colorado; New Hampshire; California;\u00a0Oregon;\u00a0Washington state;\u00a0Arizona; New Mexico; Hawaii; Minnesota; one of Nebraska's five electoral votes; and at least three of\u00a0Maine's four electoral votes. That represents a total of 238\u00a0electoral votes. WHAT TO KNOW ON ELECTION DAY 2020: CULMINATION OF THE BATTLE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE The Fox News Decision Desk also projects\u00a0that Trump will\u00a0win Kentucky;\u00a0West Virginia;\u00a0Alabama;\u00a0Mississippi;\u00a0Tennessee;\u00a0Missouri; Arkansas; Indiana; Kansas; Louisiana;\u00a0Oklahoma; Wyoming; North Dakota;\u00a0South Dakota;\u00a0South Carolina;\u00a0Utah;\u00a0Idaho;\u00a0Florida; Ohio;\u00a0Texas; Iowa; Montana; and at least four of Nebraska's five electoral votes. That represents a total of 213\u00a0electoral votes. Election Day Tuesday marked\u00a0the end of a presidential race where Americans -- who have cast more early and mail ballots this year than in any past election -- had their say on whether to give Trump a second term or go a different direction with Biden. The year 2020 was highly unusual. There was an impeachment trial, an ongoing pandemic, racial protests and riots.\u00a0The president was diagnosed with the coronavirus and\u00a0a presidential debate was canceled because Trump refused to participate in a virtual affair after his diagnosis. But despite all of that,\u00a0votes were being counted into Wednesday morning --\u00a0and perhaps a little later --\u00a0as Americans sought to elect\u00a0a president as they have every four years since 1788. \"A vote for me and the Republican Party is a vote for the American Dream!\" Trump said in a Monday night tweet as he made his final pitch to voters. \"Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.\" FOX NEWS ELECTIONS 2020: SEE THE LIVE RESULTS HERE \"We can overcome these crises. We can take our country back. We can win the battle for the soul of the nation,\" Biden said in a Tuesday tweet. There was no obvious\u00a0winner, however, of the election on Tuesday night or early Wednesday because some states were taking\u00a0longer than usual to count their mail-in and absentee ballots. Those ballots were more labor-intensive to count than standard ballots that voters cast in person. Some states, including Pennsylvania and North Carolina, also were accepting ballots that were mailed by Election Day but would arrive days later. In Pennsylvania, that period wil last three days while in North Carolina it will last\u00a0nine. Therefore, with close races in major swing states, and a significant portion of the vote\u00a0uncounted, it could be days or even longer until there is a clear result of\u00a0the election. BIDEN PLEDGES TO 'RUN THROUGH THE TAPE' DURING ELECTION DAY STOP IN NATIVE PENNSYLVANIA Nevertheless, Election Night provided\u00a0a window\u00a0into several important issues that could tip the race one way or another: Election Day turnout; vote breakdowns in key counties in swing states; how independents are voting, and more. In addition to the presidential race, which is directing\u00a0attention to battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and others, the\u00a0battle for the Senate remained undecided as well. DEMOCRATS RETAIN CONTROL OF HOUSE, BATTLE REMAINS FOR SENATE MAJORITY Races in states like Maine, North Carolina and more\u00a0will\u00a0decide whether Republicans, who are largely on defense this election cycle, will hold onto their majority, or if Democrats can take back the chamber. The races that were called late Tuesday and Wednesday, however, largely turned in favor of Republicans. The makeup of the Senate will be key in how much either Trump or Biden will be able to advance their agendas if elected, especially as the House of Representatives is likely to remain in Democratic hands. The Fox News Decision Desk called expensive races for\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., over\u00a0Democratic challenger Amy McGrath; Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., over Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison and\u00a0Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, over Democratic candidate Theresa\u00a0Greenfield. Republicans flipped one Senate seat in Alabama, with challenger Tommy Tuberville beating incumbent Democrat Doug Jones, the Fox News Decision Desk projected. The Fox News Decision Desk also projected that Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., will beat Democratic challenger and former Gov. Steve Bullock. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the Fox News Decision Desk also projected that former Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado will beat incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., in a major flip for Democrats. Democrat challenger Mark Kelly will also unseat Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., according to the Fox News Decision Desk. The Fox News Decision Desk has projected that Democrats will retain control of the majority in the House of Representatives despite what Republicans are calling a successful election night for their House caucus. One notable seat that was flipped: Republican challenger Maria Elvira Salazar beat Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., in her\u00a0South Florida district. Over the coming hours and days, Americans and the world will find out whether voters chose to continue with the vision of Trump and the Republican Party, or if they chose a new direction with Biden and Democrats. That result, however, could be the subject of intense dispute and eventually take a court decision to finalize. Fox News' Bianca Lumpkin and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

There was no early night. There was no Democratic progressive realignment.\" FOX NEWS ELECTIONS 2020: SEE THE LIVE RESULTS HERE \"In fact, the Democratic down-ballot disasters carried all the way to the state legislatures as well. The Democrats did not flip a single state legislature and in fact, the Republicans flipped the house and the senate, for example, in a place like New Hampshire, where they have a Republican governor. So that's solid now,\" Conway, former counselor to the president, said. She pointed out that Republican pickups were carried by women, minorities, and/or veterans\u00a0whereas\u00a0Democrats spent big money to elect those categories but lost in key races like against Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The Republican message carried them forward and no one in the media nor pollsters paid attention to that, Conway said. NANCY MACE FLIPS SC HOUSE SEAT: REPUBLICAN WOMEN 'BREAKING BARRIERS' \"You know when I took over as campaign manager in 2016, we did zero ... national polls from that point forward. They're not relevant. They tell you trends but they don't dig into the electoral college map. Electability, I can tell you whether you can or can't win, I can tell you is outdated. That's why Republicans lost the presidential races for years. Electoral College is how you do or don't win,\" she said. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who claimed victory Wednesday after her opponent conceded did not win a single poll in the state, but she won the race by close to nine points, Conway pointed out. JOE CONCHA: 'SHY TRUMP VOTERS' MISSED AGAIN AS POLLS OVERSTATED JOE BIDEN'S SUPPORT \"Where is the consequence?\" Conway said. \"The Trump agenda won up and down the ballot. We're holding the Senate. We picked up in the House, the state legislatures, Pelosi's got a big problem because the Squad that doesn't do squat except be famous for being famous ... It was a real rebuke.\" Conway said she told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace, in 2017, that none of the pollsters or pundits who wrongly predicted the 2016 election lost their job and she predicted\u00a0the same will happen in 2020. \"Nobody cares and nobody wants to cure this problem,\" Conway said. \"The polls were not scientific evidence ... they're wishful thinking.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Conway said she is concerned that members of the media and pollsters didn't spend the last four years figuring out what motivates Trump supporters. \"I think we should be exposing some of the people in charge of this who have a history of being wildly anti-Trump,\" she concluded.",

TRUMP 'NOT BACKING DOWN,' CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAYS URGING STAFF TO 'HAVE PATIENCE' AMID LEGAL BATTLES The official told Fox News that Pence began by thanking everyone, and then said something in line with what he tweeted. The official told Fox News that the mood among the staff was described as encouraged by the vice president\u2019s spirit. Vice President Mike Pence wears a face mask as he arrives for an airport rally, Thursday, Oct. 29, 2020, in Des Moines, Iowa.

The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania\u00a0and Georgia. The Fox News Decision Desk called the race for Biden on Saturday after results in Pennsylvania and Nevada put him above the 270 electoral vote threshold necessary to clinch victory in the Electoral College. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have attempted to calm the public, insisting that all votes will be counted no matter how long it takes. TRUMP WOULD CONCEDE, WORK ON PEACEFUL TRANSITION IF LEGAL FIGHT FALLS SHORT, SOURCES SAY, DESPITE TWEETS \"It's time for America to unite. And to heal,\" Biden said in a statement after his win was declared.

            "article_content": " Thousands of military ballots have yet to be counted in Georgia,\u00a0which some say could give a boost to President Trump\u2019s numbers in the state, even as Democratic nominee Joe Biden pulls slightly ahead in the race to claim the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes. Biden\u00a0early Friday\u00a0was leading in the state with 2,449,371 votes, or 49.39% of the ballots cast, while the president had 2,448,454 votes, or 49.37% of the ballots cast. But there are thousands of military, overseas and provisional ballots that will soon be added to the vote tally. BIDEN TAKES SLIGHT LEAD IN GEORGIA, AS MORE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED Military and overseas ballots have a later deadline than other absentee ballots and were required in Georgia to be postmarked by Nov. 3. Those ballots will be counted, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, if they are received at the county election offices by Friday, Nov. 6, at 5\u00a0p.m. ET. By today\u2019s deadline, Georgia could receive anywhere from zero to 8,899 military and overseas ballots. Those ballots\u00a0could make a difference, according to Count Every Hero, an advocacy group with members including retired and former leaders like former Joint Chiefs Chairman Joe Dunford Jr. \u201cThe military ballots will be key in Georgia,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tweeted this week. But the latest vote count shows Biden in the lead. As of Friday mornig, the Fox News Decision Desk shows Biden needing just six more electoral votes to reach the magic number of 270,\u00a0and winning Georgia -- if Biden maintains his newfound lead -- would put the former vice president 10 points over the mark. Meanwhile, key battleground states have yet to be called -- like Pennsylvania, North Carolina\u00a0and Nevada. Trump is still in the race if he can manage to win key battleground states and make a comeback in Georgia as the mail-in and military votes continue to be counted.

            "article_content": " A slate of tightly contested Senate races will determine which party takes control of the upper chamber of Congress after the 2020 election. Republicans currently hold a\u00a053-47 majority in the Senate, but a number of incumbents face fierce challengers from Democratic rivals. The Democrats would need to flip at least four seats to retake control. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden defeats President Trump, the party would need to gain just three seats, with the vice president serving as a tiebreaker. McConnell says Democrats have '50-50' odds of flipping Senate control Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned\u00a0it was a \u201c50-50 proposition\u201d that the GOP would retain control. The Democrats have held a majority in the House since the 2018 midterms. \u201cWe have a lot of exposure. This is a huge Republican class,\" McConnell said during a campaign stop in Kentucky. \"There are\u00a0dogfights all over the country.\" Fox News breaks down the key battleground Senate races of the 2020 election below. Alabama:\u00a0Sen. Doug Jones (D) vs. Tommy Tuberville (R) Jones faces the difficult task\u00a0of retaining his seat in a red state that is expected to overwhelmingly support President Trump\u2019s re-election. Tommy Tuberville, the former head football coach at Auburn University, is a local legend and defeated former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the GOP primary. Cook Political Report projects the race with a slight \u201clean\u201d toward Tuberville. Arizona: Sen. Martha McSally (R) vs. Mark Kelly (D) McSally, who was appointed to the Senate in 2019 to replace the late Sen. John McCain, faces a tough challenge from Kelly, a former astronaut and moderate Democrat. McSally appeared alongside President Trump at several of his recent campaign rallies in the battleground state. Cook Political Report projects Kelly with a \u201clean\u201d advantage over the incumbent. Colorado:\u00a0Sen. Cory Gardner (R) vs. John Hickenlooper (D) Gardner faces an uphill battle to retain his seat in a state expected to lean toward the Democrats in the 2020 election. Hickenlooper launched his Senate bid after a failed attempt to secure the Democratic presidential nomination. Cook Political Report projects the race with a slight \u201clean\u201d toward Hickenlooper. Georgia:\u00a0Sen. David Perdue (R) vs. Jon Ossoff (D) Perdue canceled his final debate with Ossoff this week to attend President Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Georgia. The Senate race has grown contentious in recent days, with Ossoff hammering Perdue on his health care voting record. During their last debate, Ossoff labeled Perdue a \u201ccrook\u201d who has been accused of insider trading, while Perdue claimed Ossoff has problematic ties to a Hong Kong-based\u00a0media company. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Georgia:\u00a0Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in special election Loeffler, the wealthiest U.S. senator, is looking to retain the seat she inherited after Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned in 2019 for health reasons. Her\u00a0opponents includes Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat and prominent civil rights leader. If no candidate secures at least 50%\u00a0of the vote, the top two vote-getters in November will proceed to a runoff election. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Iowa:\u00a0Sen. Joni Ernst (R) vs. Theresa Greenfield (D) Ernst faces a tough challenge in her quest for a second term from Greenfield, a real estate developer who has campaigned on greater health care access, and support for local farmers amid the U.S.-China trade dispute. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss up.\u201d Maine:\u00a0Sen. Susan Collins (R) vs. Sara Gideon (D) Collins, considered a centrist Republican, is seeking re-election in a state that is expected to vote for Biden in the general election. The incumbent may have jeopardized her standing with Republicans by voting against Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Gideon has argued that Collins has aligned herself more closely with the Trump administration to the detriment of state residents. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Montana:\u00a0Sen. Steve Daines (R) vs. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) Trump is expected to easily win the state of Montana, which should help Daines in his fight against Bullock. The governor unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, but has remained popular in the state. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d North Carolina:\u00a0Sen. Thom Tillis (R) vs. Cal Cunningham (D) Aside from its pivotal role in 2020 presidential race, North Carolina\u2019s Senate race is considered a crucial bellwether in the fight for control of the Senate. Tillis, a prominent Trump supporter, has trailed Cunningham in polls throughout the race. However, Republicans have seized on a sex scandal involving Cunningham and the wife of a military veteran and argued that he is unfit for office. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss up.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP South Carolina:\u00a0Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) vs. Jaime Harrison (D) A fixture on the national political scene, Graham is in danger of losing his Senate seat in a tough race against former Democratic aide Jaime Harrison. The challenger has touted his personal history overcoming poverty in a campaign pitch to help middle-class families in South Carolina and pursue expanded health care coverage. Graham, meanwhile, has returned to the national spotlight in recent days after he played a key role in Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Texas:\u00a0Sen. John Cornyn (R) vs. MJ Hegar (D) Cornyn has held his seat since 2002 and has maintained a commanding lead in the polls against Hegar throughout the race. However, the Democratic Party has been adamant that Texas could vote for Biden in the presidential election, fueling hopes for a similar upset victory in the Senate race. Cook Political Report gives Cornyn a slight edge in the race.",

On Tuesday, Joe Biden will finally \u2013 finally \u2013 be forced to answer tough questions from a non-sycophant newsman. Can the Democrat candidate survive 90 minutes of an unscripted, fast-paced presidential debate without claiming to have been in the Senate for 180 years or putting the COVID-19 death toll at 200 million Americans, goofs he has made in recent days? Can he endure the challenges sure to come from President Trump without wandering off into the ether? That is the\u00a0question, the\u00a0elephant in the room. NEWT GINGRICH: HOW THE BIDENS WORKED WITH CHINA TO GET RICH\u00a0\u2014 AT AMERICA'S EXPENSE The spotlight will be on Biden. Voters know Trump.\u00a0They have seen him at rallies, at press gaggles, in\u00a0interviews; for better or worse, they\u00a0know what to expect. They do not know\u00a0Biden\u00a03.0, now in his third presidential campaign. He has engaged in very few give-and-takes with reporters or even with donors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER For months, Republicans have looked forward to the\u00a0presidential\u00a0debates, eager for the nation to see\u00a0the Democrat candidate\u00a0Joe Biden naked,\u00a0without his teleprompter. Trump\u00a0supporters\u00a0may\u00a0be disappointed\u00a0if they anticipate an epic collapse from Biden.\u00a0The Democrat\u00a0has prepped for days for the debate, and he can most likely endure a short exposure without embarrassing himself. But Republicans should be just as eager to see Biden pressed on the issues. Seeking turnout from the progressive wing of his party, Biden has moved far to the left, even as he still pretends to be a moderate. Voters need to hear how he plans to spend $7 trillion of their tax dollars on programs aimed at achieving racial justice and \u201cgreening\u201d our country. They need to assess his proposed $4 trillion tax hike, which will clobber all Americans, despite his claims to the contrary. Moderator and Fox News anchor Chris Wallace has listed six topics that he will address, including COVID-19, the Supreme Court, the economy, Trump and Biden\u2019s records, race and violence in our cities, and the integrity of the election. Here are just a few of the things Biden ought to address. His answers\u00a0could easily shake up the race. On the\u00a0economy, which routinely ranks as voters\u2019 primary issue: Recent Census data shows that in 2019, before the pandemic savaged our economy, household incomes rose 6.8%. The poverty rate declined to the lowest since records began, and income inequality also\u00a0narrowed.\u00a0Republicans claim\u00a0those gains, which led to the\u00a0lowest unemployment in decades,\u00a0stemmed from lower taxes and less regulation. Biden has promised to raise taxes by $4 trillion and to re-impose regulations removed by President Trump.\u00a0Why does he think we should reverse course, especially as the country struggles to emerge from the\u00a0COVID-enforced downturn? The left-leaning Tax Policy Center estimates that Biden\u2019s proposed tax hikes will mean a loss of income for all Americans, including those in the lowest-earning groups, since higher corporate taxes lead to lower wages. The TPC estimates that \u201cFor low- and middle-income households, the reduction in wages and investment income would, on average, more than offset the effects of Biden\u2019s new tax credits.\u201d Is that a desirable outcome? How can Biden defend the status quo in public education when our\u00a0inner city\u00a0schools fail so many families of color? Biden\u2019s energy program calls to phase fossil fuels out of our power grid by 2035, notwithstanding that our emissions are declining thanks to an enormous supply of relatively clean natural gas. But electricity costs in the U.S. are about one-third of those in Germany, for instance, which are higher due to government climate policies\u00a0similar to\u00a0yours. How would the former V.P.\u00a0justify significantly raising electricity costs for American families? On race and violence in our cities: In 2016, 89% of Black Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, continuing their historical attachment to the Democrat Party. And yet, Democrats appear to ignore Black voters\u2019 preferences on several issues. For instance, a recent poll showed that 68% of Black families are in favor of school choice. Campaigning in February, Biden claimed not to be a \u201cfan\u201d of charter schools. His unity task force platform reiterates Democrats\u2019 opposition to \u201cprivate school vouchers and other\u202fpolicies that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from the\u00a0public school\u00a0system.\u201d How can Biden defend the status quo in public education when our\u00a0inner-city\u00a0schools fail so many families of color? What would the candidate say to Black\u00a0parents who want improved opportunities for their children? Similarly, a recent Gallup poll shows 81\u00a0percent of Black Americans said they'd like\u00a0police to spend either more or the same amount of time in their community, while only 19 percent of those\u00a0surveyed\u00a0said they wanted police to spend less time. And yet, many Democrats are calling for defunding the police. Biden has said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d approve of diverting funds away from police budgets. Is that helpful to minority neighborhoods that have suffered the brunt\u00a0of the rioting\u00a0in recent\u00a0months? On the Supreme Court: Democrats accuse Republicans of hypocrisy in moving forward to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but in 2016 Biden wrote in an op-ed\u00a0that,\u202f\"I know there is an argument that no nominee should be voted on in the last year of a presidency. But there is nothing in the Constitution \u2014 or our history \u2014 to support this view.\u201d In a speech at Georgetown University, he said, \u201cI would go forward with a confirmation process as chairman, even a few months before a presidential election if the nominee were chosen with the advice, and not merely the consent, of the Senate.\u201d But now Biden has said that Republicans confirming a Supreme Court nominee could provoke a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d Why is this time different? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On COVID-19: Biden has said he could have managed the COVID-19 outbreak better than President Trump, and points to his involvement in managing the swine flu epidemic, which sickened 61 million Americans. But it appears the CDC was largely in charge of battling the epidemic. According to numerous White House press briefings on the subject, Vice President Biden was not mentioned. What exactly was Biden\u2019s role in combating the\u00a0disease? Voters want to hear from Joe Biden; they are about to get their chance. It\u2019s about time. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

            "article_content": "A Republican has not flipped a Democratic House seat in California since 1998. Democrat Christy Smith conceded the special election race for California's 25th Congressional District to Republican Mike Garcia on Wednesday, marking the first time Republicans will retake a\u00a0Democratic-held congressional seat in the state\u00a0since 1998 -- and, Republicans said, indicating that enthusiasm for President Trump is strong heading into the 2020 elections. Garcia, a former Navy combat pilot, had a 12-point edge over Smith, a state assemblywoman, as of late Tuesday night in the contest for the swing-district\u00a0seat vacated by Katie Hill after her resignation. Trump had declared victory on Twitter early Wednesday morning, but Smith initially\u00a0held off on acknowledging defeat, as an unknown number of ballots remained uncounted. \"While it's critical that we ensure every vote is counted and recorded, we believe that the current tally shows Mike Garcia is the likely victor in the May 12 special election,\" Smith said in a statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0\"As such, I'd like to congratulate him.\" Trump lost the district by 6 percentage points\u00a0in 2016. He\u00a0went out of his way to promote Garcia in recent weeks as strong on guns and immigration, and some Democrats had hoped he would be a liability in the race. Former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats all lined up behind Smith. The seat became vacant last year after the resignation of Hill, who stepped down after admitting to an affair with a campaign worker and the House opened an ethics probe into an allegation that she was involved with a member of her congressional staff, which Hill denied.

Terrill) Smith and Garcia topped a crowded field of candidates in the state\u2019s March 3 primary and advanced to separate elections: One, on Tuesday, to fill the remainder of Hill\u2019s two-year term, and a second in November for the full, two-year term starting in 2021. Two years ago, Democrats picked up seven Republican House seats in California, helping the party retake control of the chamber. The GOP now holds just six of California\u2019s 53 House seats. The 25th District anchored in Los Angeles County, with a slice of Ventura County with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on its western end, has a Democratic registration edge and Hill captured the seat by 9 points in 2018. \"So proud of Navy combat vet\u00a0@MikeGarcia2020\u00a0for his outstanding Election Night!\" remarked New York GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, as initial results came in on Tuedsay. \"Proud to support him! I know he worked incredibly hard A LOT of swing district newly elected House Dems nervously watched these results. Big trouble for Nancy Pelosi!\" TOP REPUBLICAN ISSUES 'CALL TO ARMS,' SAYS DEMS TRYING TO STEAL 25TH DISTRICT SEAT Added Trump:\u00a0\"Big Congressional win in California for Mike Garcia, taking back a seat from the Democrats. This is the first time in many years that a California Dem seat has flipped back to a Republican. Also, Tom Tiffany beat his Democrat rival BIG in Wisconsin. Two great Congressional WINS!\" Meanwhile, Trump himself put up historic numbers in the\u00a0Nebraska\u00a0presidential primary\u00a0on Tuesday, more than\u00a0doubling\u00a0his 2016 total in the state. That led GOP Chairwoman\u00a0Ronna McDaniel to tout what she called surging \"enthusiasm\" for the president's reelection. In Wisconsin, Republican Tom Tiffany, a state senator endorsed by Trump, easily won a\u00a0special congressional election\u00a0Tuesday in the state's heavily conservative, rural 7th Congressional District. Tiffany\u2019s win over Democrat Tricia Zunker in northern Wisconsin\u2019s 7th District comes in the state\u2019s second election amid the coronavirus pandemic the past five weeks. Tiffany will replace former reality TV star Sean Duffy, a Republican who retired in September. The district, which covers all or parts of 26 counties, has been vacant since Duffy\u2019s retirement. Trump won Wisconsin by less than a point, but carried the district by 20 points, in 2016. Trump backed Tiffany in the race, but due to the pandemic was unable to campaign in person for him.

As voters wait with bated breath for the outcome of\u00a0Tuesday's election, pundits and strategists are looking for clues in battlegrounds like Arizona. The Sun Belt state's\u00a0Maricopa County is\u00a0the nation's fourth-largest county in terms of population. It's also home to the capital city of Phoenix and represents more than 60% of the state's electorate. A candidate for statewide office has won election only once without carrying Maricopa. DEMS GRASP AT OPPORTUNITIES IN RED STATES AS ELECTION DAY LOOM Of the 4.7 million residents in Maricopa County, one-third\u00a0identify as Latino, according to U.S. census data. The Latino vote is more important than ever for the two candidates, and this year the group is expected to be the nation's\u00a0largest racial or ethnic minority\u00a0in a U.S. presidential election. According to the Pew Research Center, Latinos will account for\u00a013.3% of all eligible voters.

Franklin) Maricopa County is one of 11 counties with more than 1 million Latinos, about 31% of the population. While the majority of residents are White suburban voters, changing demographics with the addition of young voters and transplants have turned the historically red Arizona into a toss-up. Some 200,000 new residents have moved into the Grand Canyon State since 2016 -- shaving the GOP's voter registration advantage by 50,000, according to The Hill. Democrats\u00a0elected\u00a0progressive Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in the 2018 midterms and are now favoring former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly over Republican Sen. Martha McSally. Last week,\u00a0The Associated Press reported\u00a0that Democrats have a shot at taking control of one or both chambers of the state's predominantly Republican\u00a0legislature\u00a0for the first time in nearly three decades. While Arizona has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996, polls\u00a0in the state slightly favor former vice president Joe Biden. An\u00a0OH Predictive Insights poll found Biden leading President Trump in Maricopa by a 51%-to-45% margin. Millions of votes have already been processed and 90% of Arizona voters are expected\u00a0to vote early, either by mail or in person. Early voting began in the Copper State on Oct. 7. The candidates have recognized the importance of Arizona, making multiple trips in the run-up to the election.

            "article_content": " The only sure thing in Montana's U.S. Senate race was that a Steve would be going to\u00a0Washington. Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, narrowly defeated the state's popular two-term Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock\u00a0in a highly competitive race that drew national attention. Daines, 58, beat out Bullock,\u00a052.8% to 47.2%, according to The Associated Press. The race was key in Democrats'\u00a0hopes to re-take control of the Senate.\u00a0The contest broke records for a Montana campaign with $150 million spent by candidates and outside groups. Bullock\u00a0announced his candidacy after a short-lived\u00a0presidential bid in which he failed to stand out from a crowded field of Democrats. He initially said he would enter the\u00a0Senate race before backpedaling. The Senate race was one of the most competitive and expensive of the 2020 election cycle with Daines, at one point, leading by a percentage point in various polls ahead of Election Day. Bullock, a Montana-born attorney from Helena, was hoping to use his popularity in a reliably conservative state to aid a Democratic push to re-take the Senate. President Trump won the state by 20 points in 2016. Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Sen. Steve Daines speaks at a campaign stop in Clancy, Mont. (Associated Press) Daines, a California native, and Bullock\u00a0clashed over the coronavirus response, gun ownership and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. CLICK HERE TO SEE FOX NEWS\u2019 LIVE PROBABILITY DIALS Bullock accused Daines of stalling on a second federal coronavirus relief package while saying he would not impose stricter measures to combat the virus because there was no federal safety net for business owners and workers. The governor was praised for his swift COVID-19 response in the spring, which included a shutdown order that helped keep the virus at bay. But as the state reopened in early summer, the case tally began to climb. A record number of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths were reported in recent days, as the governor delegated responsibility for precautions to local authorities. Bullock also rejected the confirmation process for Barrett, saying it put the Affordable Care Act in jeopardy. Daines survived attacks about his business ties to China and support for repealing the ACA. Days before the election, the race was in a dead heat with no clear frontrunner. Polling showed Bullock\u00a0and Daines switching back and forth for the top spot. Bullock ran on his record of bipartisanship and portrayed himself as a fighter for public lands while casting his GOP opponent as a threat to the ACA. In July, Bullock successfully sued to remove the top official at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Montana Gov.

As of mid-October, Pendley still was working despite the ruling. Trump has been largely absent from the race. In 2018, he hosted rallies in the state in a failed bid to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Daines\u00a0tied himself to Trump, backing his tax cuts and immigration policies while also defending him during his impeachment trial.

            "article_content": "Is the Trump campaign under pressure to reset before the election? Trump 2020 campaign press communications director Erin Perrine responds. President Trump has been narrowing\u00a0the gap in recent weeks with Democratic challenger Joe Biden\u00a0both in national polling and in some key battlegrounds \u2014 a development his new campaign manager is crediting in part to his relaunched coronavirus briefings. This is not to say the president is in comeback territory. His approval ratings remain deeply underwater, and he's trailed Biden in virtually every national poll since the beginning of the year,\u00a0even before the coronavirus pandemic, racial unrest and more presented an unprecedented test to his presidency. TRUMP CAMPAIGN RE-LAUNCHES AD STRATEGY WITH NEW FOCUS ON KEY EARLY VOTING STATES The latest RealClearPolitics national polling average, though, shows Trump trailing Biden by just over six\u00a0points, compared with nine\u00a0points a month ago. More significantly,\u00a0the race is tightening in some key swing states. In Florida, Biden is leading by four\u00a0points, according to the RCP average, down from roughly eight points in late July. And Trump is also seeing a tightening in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, trailing Biden by roughly five\u00a0points in each -- though the needle has not moved much in Michigan. This comes as the Trump administration continues to face criticism for its pandemic response, amid rising COVID-19 cases and concerns about the impact of resulting lockdown measures on the economy. His new campaign manager, Bill Stepien, however, cites as a positive factor the resumption of near-daily coronavirus briefings from the White House, which the president had been holding early on but suspended in late spring. In an interview with Bloomberg, Stepien said that when the president speaks, \u201cit\u2019s a needle mover.\u201d \u201cHe also happens to be the leader of the free world, and anytime he steps behind a podium as he does every night unlike Joe Biden, it gets covered and it matters and it\u2019s noteworthy and it\u2019s a needle mover,\u201d Stepien told Bloomberg. \u201cHis instincts are strong and there\u2019s no one better at the podium than him,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is a net positive every day of the week, polling shows it.\u201d Stepien also told Bloomberg that the \u201chidden Trump vote,\u201d or what the president himself calls \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d will help the president\u2019s reelection. \u201cThese are voters that always need to be looked after, cared for and paid attention to, because if you lose focus on them, if you take for granted key parts of the electorate like that, there\u2019s a chance that they stay at home or vote a different way,\u201d Stepien told Bloomberg. TRUMP CORONAVIRUS BRIEFINGS ARE BACK Stepien joined the campaign last month, taking the reins from Brad Parscale. Since Stepien took the helm, the president has seemed to adjust his tone on the outbreak, highlighting the importance of face masks as \u201cpatriotic,\u201d urging all Americans to wear them and follow health and safety guidelines. The campaign also briefly paused running television ads, allowing Stepien to take time to review its\u00a0strategy. On Monday, the campaign resumed airing national ads with what officials called a \u201csmarter, more strategic\u201d approach focused on early-voting states. \u201cThe countdown clock may show 91 days left in the race, but in reality, the election starts a lot sooner than that,\u201d Stepien told Fox News on Monday. \u201cIn many states, more than half of voters will cast their votes well before Election Day and we have adjusted our strategy to reflect that.\u201d In a piece of positive news, it was reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 1.8 million\u00a0jobs\u00a0in July even as many states had to pause or curtail reopening efforts. The payroll increase reported Friday by the Labor Department was nonetheless well below the 4.8 million jobs created in June, the highest ever recorded. The unemployment rate fell\u00a0to 10.2%, down from 11.1% in June. The Trump campaign touted the gains and accused Biden of rooting for economic decline in a statement: \u201cThe last three months have seen a total of 9.3 million jobs created and they represent the single greatest three-month period of job-creation in American history. ... Everyone knows that Joe Biden was hunkered down in his basement hoping for a gloomy economic report to help him politically, which puts him in the pathetic position of being a candidate for President of the United States hoping for bad news for Americans.\" But Biden said in a statement that there's more work to do, and he has a plan to rebuild: \"It did not have to be this bad. We are in a deeper economic hole than we should be because of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s historic failure to respond to the pandemic, and the pace of recovery has now slowed because of Trump\u2019s continuing inability to come up with a plan to control the virus. ... Trump\u2019s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through.\" FOX Business Network's Megan Henney contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah provides insight into President Trump\u2019s road to recovery from coronavirus on 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' The Trump campaign on Monday expressed confidence in President Trump's standing in the 2020 race despite trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in the polls, and campaign officials argued that\u00a0Democrats are \"falling short\" of their goal in requested and submitted absentee ballots. Campaign manager Bill Stepien, returning to the Trump campaign\u2019s headquarters Monday after recovering from COVID-19, touted Team Trump\u2019s voter contacts and registration numbers, as early voting and absentee voting are underway in key battleground states. \u201cVoter contact continues to be a real strength, and an open playing field for our campaign, when you compare to Joe Biden\u2019s,\u201d Stepien said, noting that the Trump campaign and Republicans have \u201cmade more than 133 million voter contacts this cycle.\u201d \u201cToday, we have a registration advantage,\u201d Stepien said. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE BIDEN-TRUMP RACE But amid the coronavirus pandemic, millions of voters across the country are requesting absentee ballots, or participating in some universal mail-in voting practices if passed in their states. Those early numbers are coming in favor of Democrats, but the Trump campaign has downplayed those figures and early numbers, while maintaining that supporters of the president will physically cast their ballots at the polls on Nov. 3. Election officials in key general election battleground states say they have noticed the surge in requests for absentee ballots by Democrats upending a trend of Republicans\u00a0in some crucial states typically dominating voting by absentee ballot through the mail. According to the latest Fox News Poll, equal numbers of Biden (75 percent) and Trump (77 percent) backers are extremely committed to their candidate and extremely interested in the election (65 and 66 percent respectively). Voters planning to cast a ballot by mail favor Biden by 41 points, while Trump leads by 11 points among those planning to vote in person. \u201cIt is really important to remember that Democrats need to have a large advantage with absentee voting, which they do, because it is how their voters\u2014Democratic voters\u2014are telling us they are going to vote, and this is how they are planning to vote,\u201d Stepien said Monday. \u201cJust a reminder, requesting a ballot is very different than voting a ballot,\u201d he added. \u201cWe see a lot of touting of absentee ballot requests, totaling with Democrat advantages, but a lot less touting of actual ballots cast.\u201d Stepien added that \u201cwith so many more requests made in 2020 than in past years, we are absolutely bound to see the percentages of unreturned ballots increase.\u201d Stepien went on to reference Florida, noting that public polling shows that \u201c55% of Democrats are saying they are voting by mail, compared to only 29% of Republicans.\u201d Stepien said that Democrats' reliance on absentee\u00a0and voting by mail ballots will have them \u201cfalling short of a win number.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cDemocrats, in Florida, to the event that they have an advantage over Republicans, they have built that by converting more historically Election Day voters to vote absentee than we have,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cDemocrats are largely cannibalizing Election Day voters and shifting them to vote earlier.\u201d He added: \u201cTo that, we say, have at it. There is no electoral impact to that strategy, and that\u2019s what we care about.\u201d In Florida, where 3.3 million people requested mail-in ballots in 2016, state elections officials have already had more than 4.2 million requests. Stepien argued that Democrats in other key states, like\u00a0North Carolina, will fall \u201cway short of their vote goal\u201d in \u201cpinning all of their hopes on absentee ballots.\u201d The\u00a0ballots requested in the first wave of North Carolina voting largely came from Democratic and independent voters. The number of requests for ballots by mail was 16 times the number the state sent out during the same period for the 2016 election. In 2016, just one-quarter of the electorate cast their ballots by mail, but this time, election\u00a0officials expect the majority of voters to do so. In states like Wisconsin, they have already seen 100,000 more requests than in 2016. Stepien said that Democrats are aware that they are \u201cfalling short,\u201d pointing to\u00a0Biden \u201cventuring out of his basement to go vote early in person \u2014 not by mail.\u201d \u201cThey know they don\u2019t have the votes they need,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cThe lesson here is that ballots don\u2019t return themselves. Ballots can be sent out, and that\u2019s all fine and good, but it takes work to get those ballots filled out and returned.\u201d Stepien touted the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cground game,\u201d saying they have \u201cthe best ground game that has ever been erected in political history.\u201d The Biden campaign, however, fired back, with spokesman Andrew Bates saying the coronavirus, which he called \"a consequence of Donald Trump's historic and tragic failed leadership,\" has had a \"stronger ground game\" in the U.S. \"than any other nation.\" \"The Biden campaign has the most advanced voter contact operation in American history,\" Bates told Fox News. \"Donald Trump has no case for four more years in which he'd continue to tear the American people apart, help the pandemic spiral out of control, and constantly side with corporate boardrooms and rich donors over middle class families.\" The latest RealClearPolitics average shows Biden leading Trump 52.3% to\u00a041.7%, but\u00a0Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser to the campaign, downplayed the polls, pointing to 2016. \"The enthusiasm in the states are very real,\" Lewandowski said. \"We feel very good with our polling numbers.\" Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager Justin Clark touted the team\u2019s efforts in \u201caggressively\u201d pushing back on universal mail-in voting in states across the nation, calling for \u201cclear and stable rules in voting around the country,\u201d \u201ctransparency in the system,\u201d and \u201cmaking sure everybody who is eligible to vote has the right to vote, and have that vote counted once.\u201d Clark called voting by mail \u201cinherently less safe than voting in person,\u201d and again said the campaign is pushing for \u201cstable rules and transparency in the system so that everyone can see what\u2019s going on in count rooms and polling places.\u201d President Trump and Republicans have railed against the practice of mail-in ballots and warned of widespread fraud in the upcoming election. The Trump campaign is bracing for the possibility of a protracted legal battle in the event of a contested election,\u00a0forming what it's calling a \u201cLawyers for Trump\u201d coalition to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of November\u2019s vote. Campaign General Counsel Matthew Morgan told Fox News last month that the campaign is urging active and retired attorneys\u00a0and even law students to volunteer in their nationwide efforts. The campaign\u2019s efforts come amid a fierce war of words between the Trump and Biden campaigns,\u00a0and their allies, over the integrity of the vote, including GOP\u00a0warnings about mail-in voting and Democrats' predictions that Trump would refuse to accept a loss. The Lawyers for Trump coalition comes as part of the joint Republican National Committee and Trump campaign's \"Protect the Vote\" effort, which has warned for months that \"Democrats are trying to use coronavirus and the courts to legalize ballot harvesting, implement a nationwide mail-in ballot system, and eliminate nearly every safeguard in our elections.\u201d Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has built a massive \"election protection program,\" including employing former Attorney General Eric Holder and hundreds of other lawyers\u00a0in preparation for a legal battle in the event of a contested election. The strategies, according to the campaign, are being directed to support\u00a0election jurisdictions in preparing for and administering the vote under what they call \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d this cycle, voter education to raise awareness of options for in-person and mail-in voting, aggressive responses to voter suppression activities, and robust programs for identifying and countering foreign interference\u00a0and misinformation from foreign or domestic sources.

When the Trump campaign first created the Black Voices for Trump coalition, many naysayers laughed and name called. When I called President Trump, \u201cthe first Black president,\u201d many more laughed and name called. When I predicted the Black awakening ahead of the upcoming election, many more laughed and name called. As we enter Election Day 2020, the laughing and name-calling is fading away. DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANSMy colleagues and I have helped Black Voices for Trump become the largest Trump campaign coalition. We have attracted hundreds of thousands of social media followers and have opened 15 community centers across American in less than a year\u2019s time. Recent polling and data is showing a growing amount of African and Latin American support for President Trump, with some polls reporting over 30% - 40% of minority voters supporting the president in the 2020 election.In a time when masculinity is under attack in America, influential minority men are defying the liberal attacks and voicing public support for the president and his policies which stand for faith and freedom. JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT \u2014 HERE\u2019S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION The attack on the nuclear family has been embraced by Marxist organizations like Black Lives Matters, Inc. and many others, creating a culture that is confusing to our most underserved and fatherless children.With over 50% of minority children in America born out of wedlock, strong men of color recognize the crisis that we have allowed to develop in our nations inner cities by continuing to elect Democratic leaders. Lifelong Democrats like myself have voted to lock up our fatherless, minority kids into failing public schools and our minority men into long prison sentences. Shame on us.Despite the narrative of racism that\u2019s promoted by liberals, President Trump is actually living up to the heroic character he\u2019s been portrayed as in Hip Hop and Rap songs for over three decades. There has been hundreds of rap songs that have praised President Trump and many by industry legends like Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Master P, Rick Ross, Redman, Ice Cube, E-40, Nas, Nelly, Ludacris, Jay Z, Jeezy, Diddy, Lil Kim, Fat Joe, Fabolous, Pharrell, Big Sean, Shaq, Meek Mill, Beyonc\u00e9 and DJ Khaled to name a few.Today, we have seen rappers from Kanye West, Ice Cube, 50 Cent, Kodak Black, Lil Pump, Wacka Flacka and Lil Wayne all support the policies of President Trump. Though I am not a fan of many of the lyrics in some of their songs, I am in unison with these rappers on their defense of masculinity and our united mission to break away from the oppressive Democratic Party policies that have ravaged our minority communities.Many minorities in America, like myself, were once blind, but now we see the impact of Trump\u2019s policies. We see an end to the lengthy wars, we see a champion for religious freedoms, we see the renegotiation of our lopsided trade deals with Canada, Japan, Mexico and China, we see manufacturing coming back to America in several industries, we see major companies returning and remaining in America because of tax and incentive plans.

We see opportunity zones that have brought over $75 billion in inner-city investments in just two years, and we see major legislation to finally address the sex and human trafficking that Democratic elites have pandered.President Trump is the first Republican president in more than a generation to make a strong effort to rally Black and Brown voters; which will prove to\u00a0be the difference in Tuesday\u2019s election.

            "article_content": "Trump, Biden exchange jabs as November election nears; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. A new poll in the biggest of the general election battleground states shows a tightening race but with\u00a0Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with a slight edge over President Trump. Two months to the day until Election Day on November 3 Biden stands at 48% and Trump at 45% among likely votes in Florida, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday. BIDEN TOPS TRUMP IN 3 KEY BATTLEGROUNDS IN NEW FOX NEWS POLLS An average of the latest public opinion polls in Florida compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates Biden with a 3.3 margin over the president. The former vice president\u2019s edge over the Republican incumbent in the White House stood at 6.2 points in the Real Clear Politics average from a month ago, on August 3. With 29 electoral votes, Florida is the biggest of the battleground states that will likely decide who wins the November election. Trump narrowly edged out 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to carry the state four years ago. President Obama also won the state by razor-thin margins in his 2008 and 2012 election victories. Twenty-seven percent of those questioned in the poll said that the economy was the most important issue in their decision on whom to vote for president, with 19% saying law and order, 15% naming the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0and 13% saying racial inequality. Likely Florida voters give Trump a slight 2-point edge over Biden when it comes to handling the economy, with Biden holding a 5-point edge on combating the coronavirus and a 12-advantage on handling racial inequality. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Aug.\u00a028-Sept. 1, entirely after Republican National Convention. Quinnipiac University was also in the field the same days in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The new poll indicates Biden topping Trump 52%-44% among likely voters. A Monmouth University survey of likely voters in the Keystone State released on Wednesday showed a tighter race. A model based on a somewhat higher level of turnout than the 2016 election puts the former vice president over Trump 49%-46%. But a model reflecting lower likely voter turnout has the race virtually tied, with Biden at 48% and the president at 47%. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin have\u00a0been carried by the Democrats in presidential elections for a quarter-century. But Trump narrowly edged out 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in all three states four years ago, helping him win the White House. Biden, who was born and spent his first 10 years in Scranton, Pa., before moving to Delaware, retains strong ties to the Keystone State. He\u2019s held several\u00a0campaign events in Pennsylvania the past two months, including a speech Monday in Pittsburgh. The president returned to Pennsylvania on Thursday evening, holding a campaign event in Latrobe.",

Now that Democrats have a nominee in the Kentucky Senate race, a highly contentious general election contest is sure to follow between GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Democratic opponent, Amy McGrath. As Republicans aggressively fight to hold on to their narrow 53-47 majority in the Senate, 23 Republican incumbents are up for reelection this year, and McConnell\u2019s seat is a most coveted one. Here\u2019s what to know about the Kentucky Senate race: Who are the candidates? Mitch McConnell McConnell was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has since been reelected five times, making him the longest-serving senator from Kentucky. Before becoming majority leader when Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015, McConnell served as majority whip and Senate minority leader. The Senate, under McConnell\u2019s leadership, is known for its record-setting judicial appointments, recently confirming President Trump\u2019s 200th judicial nominee. McConnell himself served as Jefferson County Judge and Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Gerald Ford before running for Congress. McConnell has embraced his nickname of \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d of the Senate, where the whims of Democrats under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi go to die. \u201cThink of me as the Grim Reaper: the guy who is going to make sure that socialism doesn't land on the president's desk,\u201d McConnell once said. Amy McGrath Former Marine Corps fighter pilot\u00a0McGrath has earned heavy backing from the Democratic establishment, putting her neck-and-neck funding-wise with the longtime incumbent. McGrath faced a last-minute competitive challenge from her progressive opponent Charles Booker and narrowly won her primary. Booker, a state representative, had embraced ideas from the far-left like free college and Medicare-for-all, while McGrath distanced herself from such ideas. She\u2019s positioned herself as a moderate Democrat in heavily red Kentucky, calling herself a \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d\u00a0 in 2017. AMY MCGRATH WINS KENTUCKY DEM SENATE PRIMARY, SETTING UP GENERAL ELECTION BATTLE WITH MCCONNELL During her 20-year tenure, McGrath was the first woman to fly a combat mission for the Marines and subsequently flew 88 more. After her retirement from the service in 2017, McGrath was the Democratic nominee for Kentucky\u2019s sixth congressional district before narrowly losing to Republican incumbent Andy Barr. Race overview McConnell hits McGrath for being \u201ctoo far left\u201d for Kentucky. McConnell\u2019s campaign often releases ads saying McGrath \u201cdoesn\u2019t want you to find out about her far-left record.\u201d His team points to her support of President Trump\u2019s impeachment, her opposition to the border wall and her record on abortion. A recent McConnell ad\u00a0claimed McGrath supports abortion through the ninth month of pregnancy, based on comments she made during her 2018 race for the House. McGrath\u2019s campaign has since said she respects the current law, which has restrictions and bans abortion after 20 weeks unless medically necessary. McGrath, for her part, paints McConnell as a Washington insider who represents \u201cspecial interests.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She has accused McConnell of spending too much time on tax cuts for the wealthy and not enough time on affordable health care, hitting his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Who has the edge? The Kentucky Senate race is rated likely Republican, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball.",

The whole experience has been exhausting for him. Biden has\u00a0campaigned less than any modern candidate, by far. His appearances on the trail were infrequent, but still pushed him to the limit of coherence. If you've seen him on the stump lately, then\u00a0you know what\u00a0we mean (and you still probably don't know what he means). From the beginning, Biden's handlers have bet big that this race is not about him,\u00a0but only about Donald Trump. From their perspective, and the perspective of\u00a0the people who run the Democratic Party, the nominee could have been anyone -- just as long as it wasn't an economic populist like Bernie Sanders, who would scare their donors. Joe Biden was \"fine,\u00a0whatever.\" You don't think about it and don't ask questions. Orange Man bad, vote! That's been the entire campaign. For months, that strategy seemed to be working, but it couldn't work forever. In these final hours, there are signs that voters may be starting to wonder what exactly they would get if they remove the president from office. Will things really calm down and return to normal if we elect Joe Biden? That's the hope. But would Joe Biden actually be the president? How much of his term would he really serve? Come on, let's be real about it. And if Biden did get elected and then stepped aside, which seems overwhelmingly likely, what then? GREG GUTFELD ON POSSIBILITY OF POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE Who exactly is this Kamala Harris? She\u00a0can't seem to decide how to pronounce her own name, and that tells you everything. We know she's radical. Her views are far out of step with the mainstream in this country. That's not rhetoric or a talking point. It's measurable. Look at the polls, and compare them to what she says she believes. We know she's deeply unpopular among the people who know her best. She dropped out of the Democratic primaries before Christmas because her own voters didn't like her. So that's what we know for sure, and it adds up to a pretty unappealing picture. The question is, do we want someone like Kamala Harris running this country? Well, judging by the last-minute movement in the polls (and there's been quite a bit), a lot of people are starting to wonder that. Trump has been down in the polls for months. \"He will never be reelected,\" they told us again and again and again. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yet as of right now, it looks possible they could be wrong once again. Certainly if enthusiasm is any measure, Donald Trump has a real shot at\u00a0reelection. Massive impromptu parades of Trump voters broke out in Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New York over the weekend. What does it add up to? It's far from scientific, that's for sure. But maybe it tells you something and maybe it's worth knowing about.",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The 2020 Colorado Senate race is shaping up to be highly competitive\u00a0as the Republican incumbent battles to hold his seat in a state that President Trump lost in 2016. Sen. Cory Gardner will face off against Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat. Here\u2019s what to know: Who are the candidates? Cory Gardner Gardner won his Senate seat in 2014, narrowly beating Sen. Mark Udall. He is one of two Republican senators battling for reelection in a state that Trump lost, the other being Susan Collins from Maine. In his reelection campaign Gardner has leaned on his work sponsoring the widely popular Great American Outdoors Act, a conservation bill that has passed both the House and Senate and Trump is likely to sign. Despite Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the state, Gardner has largely sided with the president, voting with him 90 percent of the time and campaigning with him in the 2020 Senate race. (Gardner, right, Hickenlooper, leftGetty/AP) HICKENLOOPER SEEKS TO OVERCOME UNFORCED ERRORS IN COLORADO SENATE RACE Politico described him in 2019 as \u201creliably conservative on most issues other than immigration,\u201d where he\u2019s known to be more moderate. Last year, Gardner was among a small number of Republicans who supported a bipartisan compromise to provide citizenship to Dreamers, but that effort failed. Gardner has also voiced a desire to do more to stop election interference by Russia. When asked if he\u2019d want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he\u2019s said \u201cObamacare has failed,\u201d but repealing it would be unlikely. Many were angered when he endorsed Trump\u2019s reelection. \u201cPeople are surprised to find out that I\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Gardner said, when asked about the uproar. \u201cI believe in limited government, I believe in low taxes,\u201d he added later. \u201cIf that makes me a conservative, that makes me a conservative.\u201d John Hickenlooper Hickenlooper served as governor of Colorado from 2011 to 2019, when he unsuccessfully\u00a0sought the 2020 Democratic nomination for the presidency. In a June 30 primary, Hickenlooper beat former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, his much more progressive rival. The contest was closer than expected thanks to a few slip-ups by Hickenlooper, a one-time geologist turned brewpub owner. In early June Hickenlooper was held in contempt by the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission after he didn\u2019t appear at a mandatory hearing, defying orders to do so as the panel considers a Republican complaint that private plane trips he took while governor of Colorado violated the state's gift ban. Mark Grueskin, an attorney for Hickenlooper, had logged onto the remote hearing 15 minutes after it started, citing problems with his Internet connection. Hickenlooper was also subpoenaed by the commission to appear but argued the hearing's remote format violates his right to face his accusers in person. Hickenlooper was also forced to apologize when, during Black Lives Matter protests, a Denver school board member unearthed a video of him comparing the work of politicians to the work of enslaved people rowing a slave ship. He also came under fire from the left when in early June he struggled to define \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d before saying the phrase meant \u201cevery life matters,\u201d before later apologizing. Race overview The race is considered key in determining whether or not Republicans keep their majority in the Senate. Gardner took a gamble endorsing President Trump, whose approval rating has gone down 16 points in the state since he took office. In 2019, Republicans lost a swing House seat in the Denver suburbs and Democrats captured the majority in the state legislature. Still, Gardner predicts the legislature\u2019s liberal \"overreach\" will work in his favor. Colorado Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn agrees. \u201cHe appeals to a lot of the unaffiliated voters,\u201d said Lamborn. \u201cHe\u2019ll run ahead of Trump.\" Colorado has more than 1.2 million people registered as unaffiliated, more than one third of the state\u2019s electorate. Gardner has classified Hickenlooper as \u201cthe most extreme-left\u201d candidate Colorado Democrats have ever nominated. \u201cJohn Hickenlooper has no ideas of his own, other than Chuck Schumer\u2019s talking points,\u201d Gardner added, referring to the Senate minority leader from New York. \u201cI vote 100 percent of the time for Colorado, and that is what I\u2019m going to continue to do.\u201d Gardner has also hit the former governor for his alleged violations of state ethics law. \u201cIf Hickenlooper wants to run a clean race then he should waive the statute of limitations and be honest about his trips on private jets and other ethics violations that were outside the statute of limitations,\u201d Gardner said Tuesday. \u201cBe honest with the people of Colorado. If he wants to be honest, be honest.\u201d Hickenlooper has sought to tie Gardner to Trump, and specifically his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is a strong, strong recognition that Cory Gardner is part of what\u2019s taking this country in the wrong direction,\u201d Hickenlooper said in an interview with the Denver Post following his primary win. \u201cThroughout much of the primary campaign, I knew I wanted to unify the party eventually, after the primary. So we focused on Cory Gardner, on why he\u00a0supports Trump\u2019s lawsuit\u00a0to get rid of the\u00a0Affordable Care Act, on how in Colorado 2.4 million people have pre-existing medical conditions and will lose their protections if that lawsuit succeeds,\u201d he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Who has the edge? The nonpartisan Cook Political report rated the Colorado senate race a tossup and Sabato's Crystal Ball rated the race likely Democrat. Polling averages showed Hickenlooper beginning July with roughly an 11 point lead.",

Within the span of just a few hours on Friday,\u00a0Republican incumbent Thom Tillis announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, while his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, acknowledged and apologized for exchanging sexually suggestive text messages with a woman who is not his wife. BIDEN CAMPAIGNING ON 'RETURN TO NORMMALCY' BUT SOME DEMS EYING RADICAL CHANGES TO POLITICAL SYSTEM IF THEY WIN Tillis\u00a0has \u201cmild symptoms,\u201d a spokesperson said Saturday, and the\u00a0diagnosis forced the first-term senator to cancel in-person events with just one month until the election.

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Mike Lee, R-Utah. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s really what I see it is,\u201d David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, said Saturday. Cunningham, who has led in polls throughout the summer and raked in a record-setting $28.3 million in donations over the past three months, apologized Friday for the romantic text\u00a0messages that he sent.\u00a0A spokeswoman for Cunningham\u2019s campaign, Rachel Petri, confirmed on Saturday the authenticity of the text messages, which\u00a0were first reported by the website NationalFile.com. SENATE DEMOCRATS CITE CORONAVIRUS IN LATEST EFFORT TO DELAY AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION \u201cI have hurt my family, disappointed my friends, and am deeply sorry. The first step in repairing those relationships is taking complete responsibility, which I do,\u201d Cunningham, who is married with two teenage children, said in a statement late Friday. Screenshots of the messages\u00a0show Cunningham told public relations strategist Arlene Guzman Todd, \u201cWould make my day to roll over and kiss you about now,\u201d to which she replies, \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.

He noted that Democrats may stand by Cunningham because the seat is key to the party winning control of the Senate. BIDEN, TRUMP SPAR OVER COVID DEATH COUNTS: 'YOU WOULD HAVE LOST FAR MORE' The race is the nation's most expensive Senate campaign and is second only to the presidential campaign in terms of overall outside spending,\u00a0according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Independent expenditure groups have poured more than $97 million into the race, data shows. Republicans are fighting to hold a\u00a0slim 53-47 majority in the Senate as Democrats\u00a0target\u00a0several GOP-held seats they believe are competitive. In order to take back the Senate, Democrats would need to pick up three additional seats and win the White House. The GOP is\u00a0hoping to win back the Alabama seat held by Democratic incumbent Sen. Doug Jones, who is considered to be one of the most vulnerable senators. But\u00a0Democrats are going after Republican senators in a growing number of states, including Maine, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Montana, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Today\u2019s\u00a0@nypost\u00a0 story on Joe Biden\u2019s corruption is a monster,\" Trump tweeted Thursday afternoon. \"Many witnesses to a crime against our Country. This isn\u2019t going away. Even the Lamestream Media is starting to say it must be covered!\" Since the initial Post report came out, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has claimed that it is the result of a Russian disinformation campaign, but Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said there was no intelligence to support that. The emails refer to the \"Big Guy\" and \"Chairman.\" Tony Bobulinski, who was listed as the recipient of one email,\u00a0told Fox News that\u00a0those are names Hunter Biden used to refer to his father, the former vice president. He also said the email was \"genuine.\" PELOSI SNAPS AT REPORTER OVER BIDEN ALLEGATION, DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT: 'I DON'T NEED A LECTURE' Bobulinski said he was the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, which he explained \"was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family.\" Fox News has learned that a\u00a0list of \u201ckey domestic contacts\u201d for a\u00a0joint venture involving\u00a0Joe Biden's brother Jim,\u00a0Hunter Biden, and CEFC included the former vice president's current running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., among other prominent Democrats. That list was part of an email that was sent to recipients including Hunter Biden and Bobulinski. The email is unrelated to the laptop or hard drive containing the other emails. The laptop that was the basis for the initial reports was connected to a money laundering investigation in late 2019, according to documents obtained by Fox News. FBI IN POSSESSION OF LAPTOP ALLEGEDLY BELONGING TO HUNTER BIDEN Fox News has also obtained text messages believed to be sent between Hunter Biden and various associates. In the communications, Hunter refers again to his \"Chairman,\" and business associate Rob Walker tells Bobulinski, \"When he said his chairman, he was talking about his dad.\" It remains to be seen whether any of this will come up during Thursday night's debate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0refused to address the issue during her weekly news conference. \"I\u2019m not answering those questions. We\u2019re talking about the coronavirus,\" Pelosi told a reporter. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Former Democratic National Committee\u00a0Interim Chair Donna Brazile had a different take. \"Bring it up!\" the Fox News contributor said about the possibility of President Trump raising the issue at the debate. She added: \"President Trump likes to divert from his own problems, his own issues of having a Chinese bank account, his own issues of having his son, this month, go before the New York attorney general about fraud, so look, if they want to divert attention back to Hunter Biden and whatever the computer alleged story is, fine.\" Fox News' John Roberts, Brooke Singman, Mike Emanuel, and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged her congressional colleagues to bolster their support for Democratic candidates\u00a0in an attempt to shore up the type of majority the party\u00a0would need if the 2020 presidential election reached her chamber. According to the 12th Amendment, congressional delegations\u00a0decide\u00a0the next president in the unlikely event that neither candidate\u00a0wins a majority (270) in the Electoral College. Going into the election, Trump has the upper hand as his party controls more\u00a0state delegations (26 vs. Democrats' 22), even though Democrats outnumber Republicans in total representatives. But because Congress doesn't declare election results until after new members are sworn in, November's results could theoretically allow Democrats to win enough state delegations prior to Congress certifiying the election results on Jan. 6. \"We must achieve that majority of\u00a0delegations\u00a0or keep the Republicans from doing so,\" Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues Sunday. \"Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats. It\u2019s\u00a0sad we have\u00a0to have to plan this way, but it\u2019s what we must do to ensure the election is not stolen.\" COULD THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE BE DECIDED BY NEBRASKA'S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT? She added: \"That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we support House Majority PAC right now.\u00a0 We have outstanding candidates in these key districts and they have built strong campaigns, but we\u00a0must forcefully ensure they win.\u00a0Simply put,\u00a0this strategy to protect\u00a0our democracy and elect\u00a0Joe Biden will take\u00a0an all out\u00a0effort and resources.\" Pelosi's comments underscored the tension surrounding an election where polling showed narrowing margins between the two candidates just weeks before voters are set to cast their ballots.

FiveThirtyEight pollster Nate Silver insisted on Sunday that President Trump can \"absolutely win\" the 2020 presidential election despite his significant dip in the polls against former Vice President Joe Biden. On ABC News' Sunday program \"This Week,\" Silver debuted his national polling average, showing Biden having a 9-point advantage over Trump, but noted that national polling \"doesn't really matter\" since Hillary Clinton isn't president today, alluding to the fact that the candidate must win the electoral college in order to become president like Trump did back in 2016. Silver noted that Clinton had a 7-point lead over Trump and that President Obama led Sen. John McCain by 6 points at this point in the race back in 2008.

Again, there's plenty of time for that and maybe also get some help from the electoral college,\" Silver observed. The pollster then looked at the electoral map, where he says Biden is leading Trump in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan,\u00a0Florida, as well as Arizona and indicated that the presumptive Democratic nominee has more paths to 270 electoral votes by flipping very few states that Trump won.

            "article_content": "Fox News contributor and former Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove joins 'The Story' with insight. President Trump\u00a0is embarking on a campaign swing through key battleground states with the\u00a0November\u00a0election\u00a0just\u00a0one week\u00a0away, as Democratic rival\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0picks up the pace of his travel with a planned trip to reliably red Georgia. The Democratic presidential nominee will stump in Warm Springs, Ga.\u00a0\u2014 population just over 400 \u2014 on Tuesday\u00a0before heading to Atlanta for a drive-in event to encourage Georgians to cast their ballots during the last week of early voting. Georgia has not backed a Democrat for president since 1992\u00a0when Bill Clinton beat incumbent President George H. W. Bush. But the Biden campaign sees an opening for the former vice president in the Peach State as turnout increases among Black voters and the Atlanta suburbs shift away from the Republican Party. According to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics, Trump has a slim 0.4.-percentage-point lead in the state. CLAWING BACK VOTES: 7 STATES ALLOW VOTERS TO RESUBMIT BALLOTS Biden's campaign pledged last week that he was \"going to campaign aggressively\" in the final 11 days before the election, but since the second and final debate on Thursday night, the candidate has only ventured out of Delaware twice: to Pennsylvania on both Saturday and Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be all across the country in our battleground states,\" Biden's campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, told reporters last week. \"He\u2019s going to be fighting for every vote. You\u2019re going to see him do in-person events. You\u2019re going to see him do virtual events.\u201d The Trump campaign has frequently taken aim at\u00a0Biden for his lack of campaign events \u00a0\u2014\u00a0Trump has dubbed his Democratic opponent \"basement Joe\" \u00a0\u2014\u00a0and reiterated that criticism\u00a0Monday. \"No events for Joe Biden today???\" Jason Miller, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign, tweeted. \"He's lid crazy!\" (Calling a lid refers to a candidate or campaign indicating to the press that they will not hold any more events, typically for the remainder of day). FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY But Biden defended his campaign approach on Monday, saying\u00a0he regularly works 12-hour days even if there are no public appearances on the schedule. He also noted that in the coming week\u00a0he'll make campaign stops in Wisconsin, Florida and Iowa. \u201cThe reason it looks like we\u2019re not traveling \u2014 we\u2019re not putting on superspreaders,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cWe are doing what we\u2019re doing here. Everyone is wearing a mask and trying the best they can to be socially distanced. ... It\u2019s important to be responsible.\u201d An average of polls by RealClearPolitics shows Biden with a solid lead nationally, although it's tighter in the key battleground states candidates need to win to reach 270 electoral votes. BIDEN MOVES ON COURT-PACKING STANCE, WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS Trump, meanwhile, is focusing his efforts on the \"blue wall\" that he knocked down in 2016\u00a0when he defeated Hillary Clinton\u00a0by winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The president regularly holds more than one campaign rally per day\u00a0and frequently visits more than one state on his whirlwind campaign tour of the country. On Tuesday, Trump is slated to leave Washington for Michigan in the early afternoon for a campaign rally in Lansing. Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, with whom Trump has repeatedly sparred, called the rally a \"recipe for disaster\" amid soaring coronavirus cases in the state and urged people to not attend the event. \u201cWe take strong precautions for our campaign events,\" Courtney Parella, deputy national press secretary for Trump's reelection campaign, said in a statement. \"Every attendee is provided a mask they\u2019re instructed to wear and has access to plenty of hand sanitizer. We also have signs at our events instructing attendees to wear their masks.\u201d From Michigan, the president is traveling to Wisconsin for a rally in La Crosse. The RealClearPolitics poll averages show Biden up 5.5 percentage points in Wisconsin and leading by 9 percentage points in Michigan. A new poll released Monday by\u00a0the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found Biden had increased his lead in the so-called \"blue wall\" states, with support above 50% in each state. 2020 ELECTION BALLOTS CAST SO FAR Trump will conclude the day with a trip to Nebraska and a campaign rally in Omaha. While reliably red\u00a0\u2014 the state hasn't voted to elect a Democrat as president since 1964\u00a0\u2014 Nebraska is unlike most states in that it does not have a winner-take-all system. Nebraska divides its Electoral College votes, giving two to the winner of the statewide vote and one to the winner of each congressional district. Nebraska has five electoral votes, four of which are almost certainly going to Trump. The presidential campaigns are also dispatching their running mates to appeal to voters. Vice President Mike Pence will hold a campaign rally in Greensboro, N.C., on Tuesday afternoon. Biden holds a slim 1.2-percentage-point lead in the state, according to an aggregate of polls. At the same time, Biden's running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, will travel to Nevada for early voter mobilization\u00a0events in Reno and Las Vegas. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "article_content": "Fox News Decision Desk team member Daron Shaw argues the 2020 election results are \u2018astonishingly similar\u2019 to the 2016 race. Both President Trump's and\u00a0Joe Biden's\u00a0campaigns on Wednesday insisted they have a pathway to victory as remaining ballots continue to be counted in key battleground states that will determine the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Election night ended Tuesday without a presidential race call\u00a0as the results in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada\u00a0and Alaska hung in limbo. TRUMP CLAIMS VICTORY WITH MANY STATES STILL UNDECLARED, HINTS AT POSSIBLE SUPREME COURT CASE But by midmorning Wednesday, both campaigns expressed confidence in their math and their pathways to 270 electoral votes. \u201cWe are confident in our pathway, we are confident in our math,\u201d Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said Wednesday. \u201cWe have confidence. We know the Democrats are pushing to count late ballots \u2014 why? Because they know, and we know, if we count all legal ballots, we win.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we count all legal ballots, the president wins.\u201d Meanwhile, a Biden campaign official said Wednesday morning that the race was moving in their favor. \u201cThis is moving to a conclusion \u2014 and moving to a conclusion in our favor,\u201d the Biden official told Fox News. Both campaigns held briefings with reporters on Wednesday morning, outlining their predictions in key battleground states\u00a0as votes continued to be counted. In Pennsylvania, where 20 electoral votes are up for grabs, the Trump campaign said Trump \u201cmaintains a lead\u201d and\u00a0there are \u201ca healthy number of ballots still to be counted statewide in excess of a million.\u201d Stepien said the campaign has\u00a0\u201cconfidence\u201d in the state, and looking at numbers, even with a \u201cconservative estimate,\u201d it feels the president could win by at least 40,000 votes \u2014 even if Philadelphia votes for Democratic nominee Biden in large numbers. But the Biden campaign official said it, too, is\u00a0confident in Pennsylvania\u00a0and expect the results \u2014 specifically with Philadelphia\u2019s large vote-by-mail results \u2014 to be announced later Wednesday or early Thursday. In Wisconsin, where 10 electoral votes are up for grabs, the Trump campaign said that the race is \u201ctight.\u201d \u201cIt is within 1% and that is recount territory,\u201d Stepien said. But the Biden official forecast a win for the former vice president in the state, saying the campaign\u00a0expects that race to be called by late Wednesday morning. In Michigan, which is worth 16 electoral votes, the Biden campaign said Biden\u00a0will have an \u201cinsurmountable\u201d vote-by-mail lead,\u00a0and it\u00a0expects that race to be called for Biden later Wednesday,\u00a0while the Trump campaign said it, too, is\u00a0\u201cconfident in a pathway that includes Michigan.\u201d In Georgia, which is worth 16 electoral votes,\u00a0the Trump campaign said it is \u201cconfident\u201d in its\u00a0math and\u00a0numbers. \u201cWe have a healthy lead and that will maintain,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cWe feel very\u00a0good about where we are in Georgia,\u201d Trump campaign\u00a0senior adviser Jason Miller said Wednesday. The Trump campaign, too, said Arizona, with 11 electoral votes,\u00a0was in play\u2014 despite the Fox News Decision Desk\u00a0and the Associated Press\u00a0calling the race for Biden late Tuesday, demanding that every vote be counted in the state that Trump won in 2016. \u201cThese are our folks, these are people who voted on the day of the election, and so we know these are our people,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo when we say the president got 62% of the ballots that came in in Maricopa County, we expect that number to be even higher as we go around the rest of the state.\u201d Miller added that the campaign believes that Trump \u201cwill win Arizona by 30,000 votes,\u201d citing \u201cfolks on the ground.\u201d \u201cWe trust our data, we trust our math,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cIt\u2019s why we feel confidence.\u201d And both the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign said they were confident in Nevada -- worth just 6 electoral votes. Neither campaign spoke about the tight race in North Carolina, which has 15 electoral votes up for grabs,\u00a0on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Biden, just after midnight on election night, spoke in Wilmington, Del., and said\u00a0he was \u201con track to win this election.\" \u201cBe patient \u2014 it ain\u2019t over until every vote is counted \u2014 every ballot is counted,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut we\u2019re feeling good, we\u2019re feeling good about where we are.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win this.\u201d Trump, in the 2\u00a0a.m. hour\u00a0Wednesday, also projected confidence \u2014 but took it a step further in declaring victory in multiple key battleground states\u00a0while hinting that his campaign would push the Supreme Court to rule over disputed ballots\u00a0and warned\u00a0that a \u201cvery sad group of people\u201d was trying to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d voters. The president, speaking from the East Room of the White House\u00a0alongside first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence, thanked his supporters and touted \u201crecord\u201d turnout. BIDEN CAMPAIGN ARGUES PRESIDENTIAL RACE 'MOVING TO A CONCLUSION IN OUR FAVOR' \u201cI want to thank the American people for their tremendous support. Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we will not stand for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe won't stand for it.\u201d But Trump\u00a0on Wednesday morning\u00a0took to Twitter railing against pollsters, saying they got it \u201ccompletely & historically wrong!\u201d \u201cLast night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the \u201cpollsters\u201d got it completely & historically wrong!\u201d he tweeted. The president\u2019s tweet was flagged by Twitter, which stated that \u201csome or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.\u201d The social media platform also flagged a Trump tweet from late Tuesday night\u00a0when the president suggested Democrats were trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. \u201cHow come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?\u201d Trump also tweeted Wednesday. As of Wednesday morning, Biden had 238 electoral votes to Trump's 213. A candidate needs to meet or surpass\u00a0270 electoral votes to be elected president.

            "article_content": "<br> When Americans woke up Wednesday, strong coffee wasn\u2019t the only thing they had brewing. Chaos and confusion\u00a0were brighter than sunrise\u00a0\u2014 and the worst part is that this pandemonium is happening by design. For months, the power-hungry Democratic Party has schemed to\u00a0tilt\u00a0this pivotal presidential election, deploying tactics that dangerously undermined the legitimacy of the democratic process in several key battleground states. Many observers sounded the alarm over the Democrats\u2019 dirty tricks in recent weeks, foreseeing just this scenario. After all, not only did the Democrats successfully persuade millions of Americans to vote by mail \u2014 a process that automatically raises logistical concerns about ballot counting and chain of custody \u2014 but they also managed to get states like Pennsylvania to implement controversial ballot drop-boxes, dramatically increasing vulnerability to voter fraud. Voters in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have already gone to court challenging the management of unattended ballot drop-boxes, and rightfully so. Since local authorities did not adequately monitor and regulate these locations, drop-boxes could have easily become contaminated with improperly cast ballots. TUCKER CARLSON: THE ELECTION THAT NARROWLY SAVED AMERICA \u201cTransparency is a key to honest and fair elections,\u201d said Phill Kline, Director of the Amistad Project of The Thomas More Society, the public interest law firm representing the plaintiffs in these states. According to the law firm\u2019s press release, voters are asking the courts for access to security camera video footage for each drop-box in light of alleged fraud. More importantly, the voters also want authorities to separate drop-box and in-person ballots to ensure that the courts can preserve the integrity of the election process. \u201cWithout such action, late ballots may spoil the properly cast ballots through comingling,\u201d Kline said. \u201cWe are dealing with unprecedented and late changes to election procedures and the United States Supreme Court has recognized the wisdom of segregating the ballots based on the time and date of receipt to preserve election integrity and to protect properly cast ballots.\u201dCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The drop-box madness, however, is only one small part of the chaos created by the Democrats on Election Day. Throughout the day and the evening, voters in battleground states\u00a0reported\u00a0a wide variety of blatant election code violations, including election interference, voter intimidation and suppression, illegal campaigning at polling places, and more. Even certified poll watchers were reportedly kicked out of polling places in Pennsylvania, or prohibited entry altogether. Other reports\u00a0alleged\u00a0that the state\u2019s election officials were blocking observation of absentee ballot processing and that observers were fearing for the integrity of the election. Undoubtedly, many of these cases will spark high-stakes litigation that could drag on for months.\u00a0We could experience an electoral experience rivaling the scenario of the comedy, \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d in which the same experience is repeated day after day. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have to wait for the traditional Groundhog Day to find out the legitimate winner of the presidential race, but one thing is certain:\u00a0 the chaos of this election is no comedy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Election Day may have come to an end, but this presidential election is far from decided. Thanks to the Democrat Party\u2019s desperate attempts to regain power by any means necessary, voters across America continue to endure chaos and confusion during this time of frightening uncertainty.

            "article_content": "Fox News political analyst Juan Williams and Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt react to the numbers as the DNC releases a new ad blaming the president for racial division. Donald Trump won Iowa\u2019s six\u00a0electoral votes by nearly 10 percentage points in his presidential election victory four years ago. But a new poll in the one-time swing state indicates a tight contest between President Trump and his\u00a02020\u00a0 Democratic challenger Joe Biden. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN According to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, Trump edges the former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee 44-43 percent among likely general election voters in Iowa. The president\u2019s 1-point margin is well within the survey\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Trump topped Biden by 10 points in the Des Moines Register\u2019s March survey. The new poll also indicates the president\u2019s approval rating has dropped from 50 percent in March to 45 percent now. Then-Vice President Al Gore narrowly won Iowa in 2000, with then-President George W. Bush winning the state by a razor-thin margin in 2004. But then-Sen. Barack Obama took Iowa by nearly 10 points in 2008 and by 6 points four years later. The new poll comes as the president trails Biden in most recent national polling as well as in many of the key general election battleground states. But there\u2019s still four-and-a-half months to go until November\u2019s election, which is an eternity in electoral politics. The new survey suggests that Iowa \u2013 which was expected to be safe territory after Trump\u2019s decisive win in 2016 \u2013 now appears to be up for grabs in 2020. THE LATEST POLLS FROM FOX NEWS The president\u2019s reelection campaign seems to be taking Iowa seriously, spending roughly $400,000 to run ads in the state the past month according to the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. And while the president hasn\u2019t been to Iowa since he held a rally in Des Moines a few days before the February presidential caucuses, Vice President\u00a0Pence returns to the state on Tuesday. The vice president \u2013 who is making his second trip to Iowa in the past five weeks \u2013 will tour Winnebago Industries in Clear Lake, Iowa, and deliver remarks to employees. The Trump campaign - responding to the poll - spotlighted their grassroots outreach ahead of the state's presidential caucuses. \"After an unprecedented turnout at the Republican caucuses this year, we could not be more confident about the Hawkeye State in 2020. President Trump\u2019s America First agenda ushered in an economic renaissance for Iowans,\" Trump campaign deputy press secretary Ken Farnaso told Fox News. The Des Moines Register poll was conducted June 7-10, with Selzer and Co. questioning 674 likely Iowa voters using live telephone operators.",

The billionaire media executive staged a brief campaign for the Democratic nomination, but dropped out of the race in March and ultimately endorsed Biden. OHIO VOTERS WILL ACCEPT STATE'S ELECTION RESULTS AS LEGITIMATE, LAROSE SAYS Earlier this month, the Trump campaign canceled millions of dollars in planned ads in Ohio, in a move his representatives touted as a sign of the strength of their position with the state\u2019s voters.

The Detroit News announced its endorsement Thursday for\u00a0John James, the Republican challenger taking on incumbent Democrat Gary Peters in the 2020 race for\u00a0Michigan's\u00a0Senate\u00a0seat. \"Michigan would gain increased influence and better representation for its people in the U.S. Senate by electing John James,\" the editorial board said in a statement.\u00a0\"It would also send to the Senate a natural leader who could well become one of the chamber\u2019s most powerful members.\u201d FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP GAINS IN OHIO, BIDEN AHEAD IN MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN The board noted that James is a \"businessman who understands the impact COVID-19 has had on the nation\u2019s industrial base, and what it will take to recover.\" \"To stimulate the economy, he advocates continued tax and regulatory reform, as well as policies that encourage more vigorous trade,\u201d the board said. According to the state's health department, there are currently more than 152,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state and more than 7,000 related deaths. MAN CHARGED IN WHITMER KIDNAPPING PLOT RELEASED ON BAIL The Detroit News also believes\u00a0that the African-American combat veteran has leadership in his DNA. \"He helped lead his family\u2019s successful auto supply business. As an Army Ranger pilot, he led soldiers in combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom,\" The Detroit News wrote.\u00a0\"And he promises to become a leader of the Senate while bringing to the body the unique perspective of a Black Republican.\u201d In addition, the newspaper assured that James will support protections for pre-existing conditions, while also pushing for market reforms to \"drive down the cost of health care\" and preserve individual health insurance policies. \u201cWe believe John James has the potential to become an influential senator who, while putting Michigan first, will also speak for a group of Americans who are greatly underrepresented in the Senate,\u201d the outlet added. MICHIGAN'S TOP ELECTIONS OFFICIAL WARNS VOTERS NOT TO MAIL THEIR ABSENTEE BALLOTS The endorsement is a complete reversal after the board put its support behind Peters in 2014\u00a0when they referred to him as \"the best candidate for the job\" despite noting that the endorsement was\u00a0a \"philosophical outlier for The News.\" The board now argues that Peters has been a \"predictable vote for the Democratic leadership, offering little to set himself apart,\u201d and that \u201che has backed the Democratic Senate leadership on nearly every key vote in his first term, including opposing three well-qualified Supreme Court nominees\" \"He cannot be counted on to check his party\u2019s worst ambitions,\u201d the group added.

It\u2019s time for Michigan to have effective leadership in the Senate where no voice will be left out.

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden makes public appeal in wake of protests; Peter Doocy reports. A new\u00a0national poll\u00a0shows Democratic challenger Joe Biden holding an 11-point lead over President Trump with five months to go until the November\u00a0general election. And the\u00a0Monmouth University survey \u2013 which was conducted last Thursday through Monday, as protests and violent clashes swept major cities across the country in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 indicates that more voters trust the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee than the GOP incumbent in the White House to handle\u00a0race relations\u00a0in the country. TAKING AIM AT TRUMP OVER RACIAL UNREST, BIDEN SAYS THE PRESIDENT'S 'PART OF THE PROBLEM' According to the poll, the former vice president currently tops Trump 52-41 percent among registered voters nationwide in a general election matchup. Biden was ahead of the president by 9 points in Monmouth\u2019s May poll and had a 4-point edge over Trump in their April survey. A Real Clear Politics average of the latest national polling puts Biden 6 points ahead of the president. The former vice president also has the edge over Trump right now in most of the recent polling in the key general election battleground states. Four years ago, at a similar point in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton held a single-digit advantage over then-candidate Trump in most national and crucial swing state polling. Clinton ended up winning the national popular vote by 2 percent, but Trump carried the Electoral College count to win the White House. Fifty-two percent of those questioned in the Monmouth poll said they have a great deal or some confidence in Biden to handle race relations, with 40 percent feeling the same way about the president. Half said they had no confidence in Trump to handle race relations, with 29 perent saying the same thing about Biden. THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS One-third of voters questioned said that race relations will be a major factor in their vote for president this year, with another 17 percent saying it will be a minor factor. Nearly half said it won\u2019t be a factor at all. \u201cThe race continues to be largely a referendum on the incumbent. The initial reaction to ongoing racial unrest in the country suggests that most voters feel Trump is not handling the situation all that well,\u201d Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said. Just under half of those polled said they have confidence in the president\u2019s ability to deal with the nation\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, with just over half saying they\u2019re confident of Biden\u2019s ability to steer the recovery. More voters \u2013\u00a038 percent \u2013 said\u00a0Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak makes it less likely he\u2019ll be reelected, with 18 percent saying more likely and four in 10 saying the president\u2019s performance will have no impact on the November results. And most voters said that current limitations on holding in-person campaign events \u2013 such as rallies \u2013 due to coronavirus health concerns will have no impact on the campaign\u2019s tone. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN \u201cThe lack of a public campaign during the pandemic may be hurting Trump, but it is not necessarily helping Biden. Trump has not been able to lean on the large rallies that generate positive feedback for him, but Biden has not been much of a presence at all on the public stage. Many voters think the Democrat could do a good job, but they haven\u2019t seen enough of him to judge for certain,\u201d Murray said. The Monmouth University Poll was conducted May 28-June 1, with 807 adults nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s sampling error based on 742 registered voters is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.",

President Trump and 2020 Democratic nominee Joe Biden are barnstorming Pennsylvania, the state that some expect could determine the outcome of the entire race, in the final hours before Election Day. .Within Pennsylvania, there are a number of counties to keep an eye on over the coming days, but the way one in particular votes is likely to indicate the outcome of the entire state. \u201cErie is an important county.\u00a0I think that\u2019s the premiere bellwether,\u201d Pennsylvania\u00a0Lt. Gov. John Fetterman told Fox News. \u201cWhoever wins Erie is going to carry the state.\u201d The reason Erie will be so indicative of the preference of Pennsylvania voters as a whole is that it is a \u201cmicrocosm\u201d of the broader state, Fetterman said. It contains urban, suburban rural areas,\u00a0college towns, manufacturing segments and a blue-collar population. The county\u2019s population count is about 269,700 and the majority of residents are white (87.4%), according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Fetterman said Luzerne County would also be important \u2013 though likely less so than Erie. \u2018RED MIRAGE\u2019 POSSIBLE IN PENNSYLVANIA AS OFFICIALS URGE VOTERS TO BE PATIENT However, it is unlikely that Americans can expect to glean a winner in either Erie County or Pennsylvania on Election Day. Each county is responsible for determining how it will handle an expected surge in mail-in and absentee ballot volume. Some officials are planning to begin counting as soon as legally possible, which is 7 a.m. ET on Tuesday, but others plan to wait until Wednesday. Additionally, the deadline for the receipt of mailed ballots is Friday, which could draw out the recording and reporting process. Fetterman indicated that because counties are prepared to hit the ground running, the results could be tabulated faster than people think. An Erie County spokesperson previously told Fox News that the county would not have any numbers to report until after the close of the polls on Election Day. An election official from the area told CNN it planned to start tabulating absentee ballots at 11 p.m. ET on Nov. 3. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump campaign held a call with reporters on Monday where officials said their current projections had the president defeating Biden by more than 1 million votes in the Keystone State. Fetterman referred to those predictions as laugh-out-loud (\u201clol\u201d) funny, adding that the state was going to be \u201creally competitive.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a margin play,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about 2020 you just don\u2019t know.\u201d Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania in 2016 by less than 1%. And former President Barack Obama carried the state by a 5.4% percentage point margin in 2012. Trump flipped the long-time Democratic-leaning Erie county in 2016 by a margin of about 1.5%.",

Under the Peach State\u2019s unusual election laws, candidates must receive an outright majority to win. Otherwise, the top two competitors head into a runoff race. A final vote count left Perdue with 49.8% of the votes and Ossoff with 47.8%. Third-party candidate Shane Hazel took 2.32%, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. A former Fortune 500 CEO, Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Ossoff was the Democratic candidate in the most expensive House race in history for Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District. Republican Karen Handel defeated him in a runoff, 51.8 percent to 48.2. Perdue, 70, was squarely ahead of Ossoff, 33, until the final leg of the race, when Ossoff made headway, leaving the two neck-and-neck. Both teams expressed confidence that they would win the runoff.

There's only one candidate in this race who has ever lost a runoff, and it isn't David Perdue,\u201d he continued.

WHO IS DAVID PERDUE: 8 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE GEORGIA SENATOR Perdue pulled out of the final debate last week after a clip posted by Ossoff attacking his opponent as a \u201ccrook\u201d went viral on social media. Perdue said he was canceling the debate to instead appear with President Trump at a Georgia rally. Ossoff had said Perdue was \"fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading\u201d after allegations arose that the lawmaker benefited from stock trades he made after a closed-door briefing on the threats of coronavirus in January. However, Perdue's campaign says the senator did not even attend that briefing.\u00a0A bipartisan Senate ethics committee, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission all cleared the Georgia senator of wrongdoing. Perdue said the trades were made by a third party financial adviser. WHO IS JON OSSOFF? 4 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT GEORGIA' SENATE CANDIDATE \"Perhaps Sen. Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you hadn't been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading,\" Ossoff said, adding: \"It's not just that you're a crook, Senator, it's that you're attacking the health of the people that you represent.\" Perdue had shot back that Ossoff worked as \"the mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China,\u201d displaying documents showing that Ossoff\u2019s media firm accepted money from a Hong Kong media company whose CEO expressed opposition to pro-democracy protests. Perdue avoided mentioning Trump in his campaign ads, instead portraying his opponent as a radical liberal on issues such as health care and police funding. Running on his record as a turnaround wizard for struggling corporations, Perdue has said he was inspired to run for office by the country's national debt crisis and national security crisis. Ossoff, as a Southern Democrat, has in the past avoided getting caught up in national Democratic politics and ran a soundly local race. He has openly said he does not support the Green New Deal and when asked if he supported adding justices to the Supreme Court amid Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation,\u00a0he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t support adding justices just because you don\u2019t like the judicial philosophy of recently confirmed justices.\u201d Though he avoided mentioning Trump during his 2017 run for the House, this year Ossoff sought to tie his competitor to President Trump\u2019s handling of coronavirus, noting that Perdue had characterized the virus as no worse than the flu. Ossoff got in one last dig at his opponent on Tuesday, calling Perdue \u201cthe swamp\u201d on Twitter, quoting a video of former President Barack Obama stumping for Democrats in his state. Obama campaigned in Georgia against the two Republican incumbents on Monday in the run-up to Election Day. \u201cYour two senators publicly were telling you that the virus would be no big deal, but behind closed doors they were making a bunch of moves in the stock market,\u201d Obama had said.

            "article_content": "\u2018Outnumbered panel\u2019 weighs in on the debate commission saying it will not reverse the decision for the second presidential debate to be virtual. It\u2019s been nearly three decades since a Democrat carried Georgia in a presidential election. You\u2019ve got to go back to 1992, when then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton won the state. But Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has a chance to break the losing streak. The latest public opinion polling indicates an extremely close race between Biden and President Trump for Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes. LIVE UPDATES: 2020 ELECTION -- TRUMP PLANS RETURN TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL AFTER CORONAVIRUS DIAGNOSIS Trump edges the former vice president by just two points \u2013 48%-46% in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll released Thursday, conducted by the University of Georgia\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs from\u00a0Sept. 27-Oct. 6. A separate poll conducted a week earlier by Quinnipiac University indicated Biden with a 50%-47% edge. President George W. Bush trounced Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry by 17 points in Georgia in the 2004 election, but Republican margins have been narrowing since then, and Trump topped Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by just 5 points in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s been a demographic change in Georgia,\u201d said M.V. Hood, a political science professor at the University of Georgia and director of the school\u2019s survey research center. TRUMP AND BIDEN SUPPORTERS OUT IN FORCE ACROSS FLORIDA But Hood added that another reason for the close contest is plenty of \u201cmoderate voters and suburban voters who are turned off by Trump.\u201d Both presidential campaigns are pouring resources into the state. Trump\u2019s reelection team has beefed up ad buys in Georgia in recent days. Their move comes a couple of weeks after the Biden campaign took to Georgia's airwaves with commercials. Hood said the pathway to a Biden victory in the state is to slightly boost turnout by Black voters and \u201cbump up his percentage of support of the White vote.\u201d The battleground states of Arizona and Nevada were also firmly in the spotlight the past couple of days. Biden campaigned in Nevada on Friday \u2013 a day after Vice President Mike Pence held a campaign event there. With President Trump sidelined from the campaign trail as he recovers from COVID-19, Pence has temporarily become the top draw for the GOP\u2019s national ticket. PRESIDENT TRUMP RELEASES UPDATE, SAYS HE'S FEELING 'MUCH BETTER' AFTER HOSPITALIZATION An average of the most recent polls in the state indicate Biden with an upper-single-digit lead over Trump. President George W. Bush was the last Republican to win the state,\u00a016 years ago. But Trump narrowly lost the state\u2019s 6 electoral votes to Clinton in 2016 by just 2 points \u2013 and his campaign has targeted the state since last year in the hope\u00a0of flipping it from blue to red. Biden campaigned in Arizona on Thursday,\u00a0joined by his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Pence was also stumping in the state on Thursday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden has a mid-single-digit lead in Arizona according to an average of the latest polls. Republicans have carried the state in every presidential election since 1952 \u2013 except for President Clinton\u2019s 1996 victory in the state. But Trump carried the state by just 3.5 points in 2016 \u2013 and both campaigns have poured resources into the state in hopes of winning Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes.",

            "article_content": "<br> Many polls didn\u2019t give President Trump a chance. Some pundits claimed Lindsey Graham could go down, others said Texas could turn blue and liberals on CNN and MSNBC believed the president would surely be repudiated by minority communities. But election night arrived and media narratives were debunked throughout the evening, with a presidential race so close that both sides essentially claimed victory. Graham defeated media darling Jaime Harrison handily, Texas stayed red, Hispanics helped Trump carry Florida and critics were left pondering the future of the polling industry. TUCKER CARLSON: MEDIA MISJUDGED TRUMP SUPPORT AMONG NON-WHITE VOTERS Regardless of who wins the presidential election, there was no blue wave, no overwhelming anti-Trump surge and the current president was not rejected as a racist bigot. \u201cThe media were wrong because\u00a0it was a mixture of wishful thinking and propaganda designed to influence the result. The people they most influenced were themselves and their leftist allies,\u201d Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News. Gainor feels the mainstream media spent four years \u201cpretending they were neutral\u201d while \u201cspouting lies\u201d about President Trump -- even calling him an agent for Russia. \u201cThe press promoted polls they told us were absolutely showing Trump and the GOP were going to get destroyed,\u201d Gainor continued. \u201cYet, here we are with a close election once more. Polling and especially \u2018news\u2019 based on it is like looking in a crystal ball, in a dark room, at night while wearing a blindfold.\u201d AN ABC News-Washington Post poll showed Biden ahead of Trump by 17 points in Wisconsin as recently as Oct. 25 \u2013 but the state remained too close to call when the candidates addressed Americans early Wednesday morning. CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Meghan McCain took notice and said that nobody will believe pundits going\u00a0forward. \u201cThe big loser tonight are the pollsters and most of the media who no one will ever believe anymore,\u201d McCain tweeted. Trump declared victory in multiple key battleground states early Wednesday, even though it remained unclear who had the votes to win, as Trump hinted the\u00a0White House\u00a0would push the Supreme Court to rule over\u00a0disputed ballots, warning that a \u201cvery sad group of people\u201d was trying to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d voters. The president was able to declare victory late Tuesday in battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and Iowa, and was able to clinch a big electoral win in traditionally red Texas, among other states, Fox News projected. CLICK HERE FOR LIVE RESULTS But\u00a0a number of key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina, were too close to call. Biden, speaking earlier in Wilmington, Del., said just after midnight that he was \u201con track to win this election.\u201d Some pundits even insisted we\u2019d have a clear winner on Election Day, which obviously didn\u2019t come to fruition. \u201cI saw James Carville, the Ragin\u2019 Cajun, on MSNBC saying we will have a winner declared by 10 p.m. last night. That worked out well. He also declared a landslide in 2016,\u201d The Hill media reporter Joe Concha said Wednesday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d CNN's Van Jones said the \"repudiation\" of Trump did not happen for Democrats\u00a0even if Biden hangs on for a narrow victory. \"People got their hopes up looking at those polls,\" he said, adding that the polling industry overall\u00a0cannot be trusted at this point. Spectator USA Washington editor Amber Athey feels the media botched their predictions, even if Biden is eventually declared the winner. \u201cThe media learned nothing from 2016 and instead doubled down on the lie that the movement for Trump was about White racism. That\u2019s why they could\u2019ve never predicted Trump picking up so much of the Latino vote in Florida and, according to current exit polls, outperforming 2016 with the black vote nationally,\u201d Athey told Fox News. CLICK HERE TO SEE FOX NEWS\u2019 LIVE PROBABILITY DIALS NewsBusters Executive Editor Tim Graham offered a few theories on what went wrong. \u201cIt's possible that the media's incessant hammering of Trump and the Republicans who dare to support him is causing people to avoid stating their support. It's also possible that so many people won't take the call because they don't trust the pollsters,\u201d Graham told Fox News. \u201cWhatever it is, our \u2018conventional wisdom\u2019 relies far too heavily on these rickety guesses. They lead to both sides of the divide feeling the system is rigged,\u201d Graham continued.\u00a0\u201cWhat's obviously rigged are these polls, trying to guess on a turnout model that doesn't match reality.\u201d TRUMP CLAIMS VICTORY WITH MANY STATES STILL UNDECLARED, HINTS AT POSSIBLE SUPREME COURT CASE However, pollsters such as Nate Silver have defended themselves, especially since Biden began closing the gap in key battleground states after Trump jumped out to an early lead.\u00a0NBC News\u2019 Dave Wasserman offered his thoughts via Twitter early Wednesday morning. DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News the \u201cmedia clearly had trouble during this election season separating responsible analysis from wishful thinking,\u201d and feels it's clear the press is not helpful in truly understanding the nation's temperature. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cOverall, the media should remember that push-polling and speculating about political elections is not like covering the run-up to the Super Bowl.\u00a0People love to make bold predictions about sporting events, because they are largely entertainment,\u201d McCall said, noting the political future of the nation is not a sporting event and is not supposed to be entertainment. \u201cIf the media recognized this, they would less likely get hung out to dry with wishful storylines about Texas turning blue or the flipping of the Senate,\u201d McCall said.

            "article_content": " Democratic presidential nominee\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0on Wednesday expressed confidence in his path to the presidency\u00a0as votes trickled in from several uncalled states, and as Fox News projected Wisconsin and Michigan would break for the former vice president. Meanwhile, President Trump and members of his campaign were declaring victory in multiple states in which Fox News has not yet projected a winner, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Trump also claimed victory in Michigan, although\u00a0Fox News has projected the state for Biden. The Michigan and Wisconsin\u00a0calls put Biden just six electoral votes away from the presidency. Biden on Wednesday afternoon struck a presidential tone in a press conference in which he said if he is eventually elected: \"I will govern as an American president.\" Expressing confidence in his chances, Biden also said that \"it's\u00a0clear that we're winning enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency\" even as\u00a0millions of votes\u00a0are still being counted and the 2020 presidential election\u00a0between him and Trump\u00a0hinges on\u00a0a handful of battleground states. TRUMP CAMPAIGN FILES LAWSUIT IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN, DEMANDS RECOUNT IN WISCONSIN Biden did not claim victory in the presidential race, but expressed strong confidence in his electoral vote path. \"I'm not here to declare that we won. But I'm here to report when the count is finished we believe we will be the winners,\" Biden said. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign announced legal action in Pennsylvania, including an attempt to stop counting ballots\u00a0in the Keystone State. The Trump campaign also said it would take similar action in Michigan. Absentee ballots are still being counted in Pennsylvania and they \"could be from Mars as far as we're concerned,\" Trump ally Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday. Although it was clear before Wednesday that it would take days to count ballots in Pennsylvania. \"We have no idea if they really are ballots,\" he said. Giuliani railed against alleged inconsistencies in how ballots were being counted, and he said that Republicans were not allowed to closely observe ballot counts. \"We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won\u2019t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead,\" Trump said in a pair of tweets.\u00a0\"Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan if, in fact, there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has widely been reported.\" There is no evidence to support Trump's claims. The race is still too early to call in a handful of crucial states and\u00a0neither candidate is at the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the presidency despite early victories in some important swing states. Trump won Florida, Ohio, Texas\u00a0and others, while Biden carried Arizona, Minnesota and New Hampshire, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. NO CLEAR WINNER IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE AS VOTE COUNTING CONTINUES, ELECTION HANGS IN BALANCE The race now appears to hinge on\u00a0Nevada, North Carolina,\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0and Pennsylvania. If Biden wins in any of those states he will be the next president of the United States. Those states all have some votes yet to be reported which, despite narrow leads for one candidate or the other, remain critical to what the final result will be in those states, and by extension, the presidential election. The Trump campaign has also said it will request a recount in Wisconsin, throwing the timing of when an election result may be final further into question. Still, votes continue to be counted Thursday the country and the world watches to find out who will be president come Jan. 20. Here's the latest in the uncalled battlegrounds: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said Wednesday morning that the Keystone State has more than 1 million mail-in ballots to count. \"I promised Pennsylvanians that we would count every vote and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\" he tweeted. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar added\u00a0Wednesday morning that there are \"still millions of ballots left to be counted ... the counties are working incredibly hard.\" \"We are going to accurately count every single ballot,\" Boockvar\u00a0said, continuing that\u00a0election counts are \"never done on the day of Election Night.\" PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR SAYS 'PARTISAN ATTACK' LAUNCHES ON STATE'S ELECTION As of Thursday afternoon, 88% of ballots were reported in the states with many left to be counted in several counties, including both Democratic strongholds and rural areas leaning toward Trump. Trump on Thursday afternoon\u00a0lead\u00a0by just under 110,000 votes. The Trump campaign's legal action in Pennsylvania includes support for a petition before the Supreme Court aimed at stopping\u00a0a rule allowing ballots mailed on or before Election Day -- but received in the three days after Election Day -- to be counted. The campaign is also suing to stop alleged blocking of GOP observers as ballots are counted and over a move by Boockvar that\u00a0Trump deputy campaign manager Justin Clark said in a statement amounted to moving \"the deadline for absentee and mail-in voters to provide missing proof of identification well past the deadline.\" The Trump campaign's legal action, according to that statement, would temporarily halt the counting of ballots. \"With these key actions, President Trump is telling all Americans he will do whatever it takes to ensure the integrity of this election for the good of the nation,\" Clark's statement continued. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes. CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS The state has reported 76% of its ballots as of Thursday afternoon and shows Biden with a slim lead of just under 12,000 The state's election division announced Wednesday morning that more results would be released\u00a0on Thursday. Votes that still need to be counted include mail-in ballots received on Election Day. The state has six electoral votes up for grabs. As of Thursday afternoon, Trump is holding a small lead of about 1.4% with 94% of votes reported.\u00a0Trump's lead equates to just over 75,000 votes North Carolina allows ballots that are mailed by Election Day but received up to nine\u00a0days later to be counted, meaning if the margin remains razor-thin it could take time for a call to be made in the Tar Heel State. \"North Carolina stopped counting votes on election night because there were no more votes to count at this time,\"\u00a0North Carolina Secretary of State Karen Brinson Bell said Wednesday. She continued that the state is now in the process of counting provisional ballots and counting absentee ballots as they come in \"provided that they were postmarked by Election Day.\" Bell added: \"We never stop counting until all eligible votes are counted and added to the final audited and certified results.\" North Carolina is considered critical to Trump's path to 270 electoral votes. Four years ago, Trump won the state by a margin of 3.7 points. The Tar Heel State has 15 electoral votes up for grabs As of Thursday afternoon, Trump holds a lead of just under 13,000 votes with 99% reporting. That is the equivalent of two-tenths of a percent. Vote counting in Fulton County was paused late Tuesday night but resumed Wednesday. \"By midday we should be pretty much through it,\" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told ABC on Wednesday morning, indicating the race in that state may be barreling toward a conclusion. But the close margins between Biden and Trump have so far precluded\u00a0projections from media organizations. \"We're doing fine,\"\u00a0he added in a press conference later in the day, expressing confidence that Georgia would soon finish its vote-counting.\u00a0\"We'll be off everyone's radar and they'll be worried about the states up north.\" Georgia has 15 electoral votes. On\u00a0Wednesday, Fox News projected Wisconsin will tip in favor of Biden, further complicating Trump's path to 270 electoral votes. Wisconsin Election Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe said on Wednesday that all votes in the state had been counted and reported except for \"one tiny township with less than 300 voters.\" \"The election has gone according to law,\" Wolfe added.\u00a0\"Every step is publicly observable.\" Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has already said that it will request a recount in Wisconsin. \"There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results,\" Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. \"The President is well within the threshold to request a\u00a0recount\u00a0and we will immediately do so.\" The Biden campaign slammed the Trump team over its statements on Wisconsin. \"What makes these charades especially pathetic is that\u00a0while Trump is demanding recounts in places he has already lost, he's simultaneously engaged in fruitless attempts to halt the counting of votes in other states in which he's on the road to defeat,\" Biden Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0\"This is not the behavior of a winning campaign. Plain and simple, Donald Trump has lost Wisconsin, he is losing Michigan, and he is losing the presidency.\" Wisconsin has 10 electoral votes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On\u00a0Wednesday, Fox News projected Wednesday that Michigan will break for Biden. This came after Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told CNN on Wednesday morning that\u00a0there will be a \"much more complete picture\" of the results in the state by the end of the day Wednesday. Benson added in a tweet late Wednesday that her state is \"not going to let any campaign, candidate, or political party stop our work to ensure every voice is heard.\" That was apparently a reaction to an announcement from\u00a0the Trump campaign Wednesday that it is filing\u00a0a lawsuit to stop vote-counting in Michigan, claiming that they have not been granted sufficient access to observe vote-counting. \"We understand the heightened focus that our state is under and our processes are under,\" Benson said.\u00a0\"The bottom line for us is we're just focused on getting this right ... in a way that can withstand any court challenges.\" Michigan has 16 electoral votes.

One of those races is between Democrat Alan Cohn and Republican Scott Franklin for Florida\u2019s 15th Congressional District, held by outgoing U.S. Rep. Ross Spano, a Republican, according to a report from the Tampa Bay Times. Republican Scott Franklin, left, and Democrat Alan Cohn, right, are competing to represent Florida's 15th Congressional District.\u00a0 (votescottfranklin.com; alancohnforcongress.com) As it stands, Florida\u2019s delegation consists of 14 Republicans and 13 Democrats. A victory for Cohn would hand Democrats a majority in Florida. In the case of a tied presidential election, the matter would be decided on by a vote from the House of Representatives, in which each state gets one vote irrespective of the size of its delegation.\u00a0A simple majority, 26 states, would be required for a presidential candidate to win. Republicans\u00a0control the delegations in 26 states. But if Cohn wins, and Democrats hold the line in other districts, Florida will likely go to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u00a0in a hypothetical tied electoral college. Florida\u2019s 15th Congressional District accounts for more than 500,000 voters who are almost evenly registered Democrats and Republicans, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Spano won the district in 2018 but he lost his bid for renomination to Franklin, a Navy veteran and Lakeland city commissioner. SEN.

McCarthy raised more than $16 million in the third quarter across all seven of his fundraising accounts. That puts his total for the 2020 election at $103 million -- the most ever for a House Republican in any election cycle, a McCarthy campaign aide told Fox News. The fundraising haul has allowed McCarthy to pump funds into individual House races where Republicans are trying to defeat sitting Democratic incumbents. Since 2019, he's put $49 million into campaign accounts of Republicans and the National Republican Campaign Committee, according to his campaign. REPUBLICANS UNVEIL NEW AGENDA IF THEY WIN BACK HOUSE McCarthy credited the fundraising enthusiasm to the contrast of leadership Republicans would bring to the House.

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is calling on Democratic House candidate Christy Smith to concede after\u00a0the California 25th Congressional District special election Tuesday as her opponent, Mike Garcia, holds a significant lead with 143,000 ballots counted. \"Christy Smith needs to do the right thing for the first time in this campaign and concede the race to fighter pilot Mike Garcia,\" NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\"Christy Smith cannot win, and the math shows this.\" The statement sent around by the NRCC cites a post from California Target Book's Rob Pyers, which says that Smith would need to win 97 percent of the outstanding ballots if turnout in the election matches that from the March primary. Pyers later clarified that if the turnout in the special election matched that of the November 2018 general election, Smith would only need 57 percent of remaining ballots. The NRCC, despite a potentially significant amoung of the vote outstanding, called on California state assemblywoman Christy Smith to concede her special election race to Republican Mike Garcia on Wednesday. Garcia, in early returns, built a double-digit lead over Smith.

Mailed ballots can count as long as they are postmarked by Tuesday and received by Friday. President Trump also declared victory on behalf of Garcia in a Wednesday morning tweet. \"Big Congressional win in California for Mike Garcia, taking back a seat from the Democrat,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"This is the first time in many years that a California Dem seat has flipped back to a Republican.

President Trump\u00a0and his\u00a0Democratic rival\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0are set to hold dueling campaign rallies\u00a0in Florida\u00a0\u2014 a crucial battleground\u00a0state vital to winning the White House\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with just five days left in the presidential race. The candidates will appear in Tampa hours apart on Thursday, looking to make last-minute appeals and\u00a0energize Central Florida\u00a0voters ahead of the Nov. 3 election. It comes as the economy remains a top issue on the minds of voters and\u00a0the Commerce Department released GDP data on Thursday showing the U.S. economy\u00a0grew at a record-shattering pace in the third quarter as businesses reopened from the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0shutdown -- something Trump is likely to highlight as Biden attacks him over his handling of the pandemic. 2020 ELECTION BALLOTS CAST SO FAR A USA Today/Suffolk\u00a0poll\u00a0released Thursday\u00a0shows Biden with a comfortable 8 percentage point lead\u00a0nationally, but the race is much\u00a0tighter in the key swing states candidates need to win to reach 270 electoral votes. An aggregate of polls from RealClearPolitics shows\u00a0that Trump has pulled into a virtual tie with Biden in Florida, just one week after the former vice president held a narrow lead in the state. Trump defeated\u00a0Hillary Clinton by 1.2 percentage points in the Sunshine State four years ago. Florida,\u00a0with 29\u00a0delegates up for grabs, is one of the biggest\u00a0prizes on Election Day\u00a0\u2014 if Trump loses the state on Tuesday, his path to reelection would be considerably more difficult. CLAWING BACK VOTES: 7 STATES ALLOW VOTERS TO RESUBMIT BALLOTS So far,\u00a0more than 76\u00a0million Americans, including nearly 7 million Floridians, have cast early in-person and mail-in ballots, according to data compiled by the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida. That's more than half of the overall turnout in 2016. Trump is set to\u00a0hold a rally in Tampa at 1:30 p.m. EST, while Biden is scheduled to visit the city for a drive-in event at 6:30 p.m. EST. Earlier in the day, the Democratic nominee will be in\u00a0South Florida's Broward County, a blue stronghold in the state that's home to 310,000 mostly Democratic Black voters. Following the Florida rally, the president will travel to North Carolina, another marquee state, for a campaign rally in Fayetteville. Biden has a slim 1 percentage point lead in the state, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll. In the final leg of the campaign, Biden is seeking to frame the battle for the White House as a referendum on Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The candidate, following\u00a0a virtual briefing from public health officials, delivered a speech from Wilmington, Del.,\u00a0addressing the virus-induced crisis. FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY \"Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I'm not running on the false promise of being to end this pandemic by flipping a switch,\" Biden said.\u201cI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.\u201d At the same time,\u00a0Trump \u2014\u00a0who often holds more than one campaign rally per day\u00a0and frequently visits more than one state on his whirlwind campaign tour of the country\u00a0\u2014 spent the day campaigning in Arizona with a pair of in-person rallies. BIDEN MOVES ON COURT-PACKING STANCE, WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS \u201cBiden and the Democrat socialists will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools and shut down our country,\u201d Trump told attendees in Goodyear, Ariz.\u00a0\u201cAnd your state is open right? Your state is nice and open.\u201d The virus has infected more than 8.8 million Americans and killed 227,701, the most in the world. Later this week, Biden will stump in three more states that Trump won in 2016: Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan, part of his effort to rebuild the \"blue wall\" that his Republican opponent knocked down in 2016. In Michigan, Biden will hold a campaign rally with former President Barack Obama. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP",

Biden overtakes Trump in Georgia race as count nears completionDemocratic nominee Joe Biden pulled ahead of President Trump early Friday in the race for Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes. The latest figures in Georgia, as of 4:45 a.m. ET, showed Biden leading 2,449,371 votes, or 49.39% of the ballots cast, and Trump with 2,448,454 votes, or 49.37% of ballots cast. Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen was a distant third in the Peach State, with 61,380 votes, or 1.24%. The numbers represented 99 percent of the total votes cast in Georgia. The shift in leadership in the Southern state were a good sign for Biden that he may soon reach the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency and deny President Trump\u00a0 a second term. The Fox News Decision Desk had Biden needing just six more electoral votes to reach the magic number of 270, and winning Georgia \u2013 if Biden maintains his newfound lead \u2013 would put the former vice president 10 points over the mark. Meanwhile, other battleground fights remained in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada \u2013 with President Trump still very much in the overall race if he can manage to win those fights and make a comeback in Georgia.

President Trump has shown time after time that he supports our law enforcement officers and understands the issues our members face every day.\u201d Yoes, in a reference to Trump's response to unrest in America's cities that has flared since the death of George Floyd in police\u00a0custody,\u00a0added that \u201cthe FOP is proud to endorse a candidate who calls for law and order across our nation.\u201d He said the decision was made through \u201ccanvassing the more than 355,000 FOP members throughout the country.\u201d Yoes went on to tout the FOP\u2019s support as \u201cone of the most sought-after endorsements by candidates running for the presidency.\u201d \u201cWe have a responsibility to our members, to the 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers in the United States, and to the communities they serve to do our part in determining the direction in which our country will head,\u201d Yoes added. The FOP endorsed former President George H.W. Bush in 1992, former President Bill Clinton in 1996, former President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, the late Sen. John McCain in 2008, and Trump in 2016. The FOP did not endorse any candidate\u2014former President Barack Obama or now-Sen. Mitt Romney\u2014in 2012. The FOP\u2019s endorsement comes after more than 175 current and former law enforcement officers and officials endorsed Joe Biden for president on Friday, while slamming Trump\u00a0as a \"lawless\" president. Fox News first obtained the list of the Biden-supporting law enforcement officials, which includes former U.S. attorneys, former state attorneys general, former sheriffs, and former police chiefs who touted the former vice president\u2019s experience \u201ckeeping communities safe.\u201d\u00a0It includes\u00a0Janet Napolitano, the former Obama administration secretary of Homeland Security who served as attorney general of Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that a lawless president claims to be the \u2018law and order\u2019 president,\u201d Noble Wray,\u00a0retired chief of the Madison, Wis., Police Department, said in a statement. Also on the list of Biden endorsements, however,\u00a0was Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, whose city faced unrest for weeks, with protesters creating their own \"autonomous zone\" and calling for defunding police. BIDEN SPEAKS WITH JACOB BLAKE, HITS TRUMP\u2019S \u2018LAW AND ORDER\u2019 PUSH DURING WISCONSIN VISIT Another endorsement on the list for the Democratic presidential nominee was the district attorney for Multnomah County in Oregon Mike Schmidt, who made headlines for announcing a new policy that he would not press charges for Portland ordinance violations that did not involve property damage, theft or the use or\u00a0threat of\u00a0force against another person, including interference with a police officer or disorderly conduct. \u201cThe crown jewels of Joe Biden\u2019s \u2018law enforcement coalition\u2019 are the Portland prosecutor who won\u2019t prosecute rioters and the Seattle mayor who withdrew police from the autonomous zone and abandoned a police precinct,\u201d Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cIf you remove the current and former elected Democrats, he\u2019s down to only a handful of real, actual cops.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that all national police organizations, representing more than 900,000 police officers, have endorsed President Trump,\u201d Murtaugh continued. \u201cThey know the President has their back and supports law enforcement against the mob.\u201d The Trump campaign pointed to more than a dozen police and law enforcement organizations endorsing the president, including the National Association of Police Organizations which represents\u00a0more than 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers; the International Union of Police\u00a0Associations which represents over 100,000 members; the FOP; the New York City Police Benevolent Association which represents over 24,000 members; and the Florida Police Benevolent Association which\u00a0represents over 30,000 members,\u00a0among others.

On Monday, the president\u2019s deputy campaign manager Justin Clark said in a statement that Democrats \u201care panicking\u201d because Biden \u201chas not run up a large enough lead in early votes in battleground states\u201d and claimed that they \u201cknow that President Trump\u2019s in-person votes on Election Day will make up the difference and propel him to victory.\u201d The Trump campaign claimed Monday that Democrats want to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d Election Day results by \u201ccoaching\u201d Biden surrogates to refer to a potential Donald Trump success on Tuesday as a \u201cRed Mirage.\u201d TRUMP CAMPAIGN\u00a0BRACING FOR LEGAL BATTLE OVER ELECTION, FORMING 'COALITION' OF LAWYERS \u201cBiden\u2019s political operatives have already been distributing talking points and research to delegitimize Election Day results by coaching surrogates to refer to the President\u2019s Election Day success as a \u2018Red Mirage,\u2019\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe operatives are advising surrogates and media to create a smoke screen by casting blame all around\u2014imaging postal delays or falsely claiming that mail-in ballots that have simply not been returned should be considered legitimate votes that need to be counted.\u201d Clark added that \u201cnone of this will be true\u201d but he said it would be \u201cheld up as proof that President Trump\u2019s victory is a so-called \u2018Red Mirage.\u2019\u201d \u201cNo one should fall for it,\u201d Clark said. Clark referenced the Biden campaign\u2019s election protection program, which they had built earlier this year in preparation for a legal battle in the event of a contested election. \u201cWe fully anticipate that Democrats will be in court arguing to extend deadlines for accepting and counting votes mailed and received well past deadlines enacted by individual state laws,\u201d Clark said. The Trump campaign added that they are \u201con guard for Democrat\u2019s to attempt to subvert state declines for receiving and counting ballots and we will fight to make sure they adhere to the law.\u201d BIDEN CAMPAIGN LAWYERS UP FOR ELECTION-RELATED BATTLES \u201cPresident Trump wants every eligible voter to be able to vote, vote once, and have it counted,\u201d Clark said. But the Biden campaign on Monday fired back, saying that \u201cunder no scenario\u201d could Trump be declared a victor on Election Night, citing historic early voter turnout, and the way in which states count votes. \u201cIt is no different than any other time and that is not something Trump should make you think is bad and wrong,\u201d Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said Monday. There is \u201cno historical precedent\u201d that any of our elections have been \u201ccompletely counted\u201d on Election night, he added. Votes from Biden supporters\u00a0and\u00a0Trump\u2019s too, including military voters, could be counted after Election night. \u201cTrump will try to go out there and declare victory in an unfounded way,\u201d Dillon warned, while noting that Biden will \u201caddress the American people.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not really concerned what Donald Trump says on Election Night because what he says might have nothing to do with the reality of it,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get distracted by it.\u201d Meanwhile, the Biden campaign\u2019s legal strategies are being directed to support\u00a0election jurisdictions in preparing for and administering the vote under what they call \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d this year,\u00a0to raise voter awareness of options for in-person and for mail-in voting, to respond aggressively to voter suppression activities\u00a0and to provide robust programs for identifying and countering foreign interference\u00a0and misinformation from foreign or domestic sources, according to the campaign. The effort includes a national team for special litigation, whose leaders include former Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger, and a team at the law firm Perkins Coie, which is led by Marc Elias, according to the campaign. THE CLOSING STRATEGY: A LOOK AT BIDEN, TRUMP'S DAY OF CAMPAIGNING BEFORE THE ELECTION Those lawyers are focusing state-by-state on protecting voter access to the polls and a \u201cfair and accurate vote count.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is also bracing for the possibility of a protracted legal battle.\u00a0It formed what it\u2019s called \u201cLawyers for Trump,\u201d a coalition to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of the vote. The Lawyers for Trump coalition comes as part of the joint Republican National Committee and Trump campaign's \"Protect the Vote\" effort, which has warned for months that \"Democrats are trying to use coronavirus and the courts to legalize ballot harvesting, implement a nationwide mail-in ballot system, and eliminate nearly every safeguard in our elections.\u201d The campaign\u2019s efforts come amid a fierce war of words between the Trump and Biden campaigns and their allies over the integrity of the vote \u2013\u00a0covering everything from GOP warnings about mail-in voting to Democrats' predictions that Trump would refuse to accept a loss. Republicans, for their part, warn there is a potential for widespread fraud and confusion\u00a0in November\u2019s election due to the unprecedented scale of mail-in ballots in states across the nation.

            "article_content": "<br> Despite projections by many news organizations Saturday that former Vice President Joe Biden has won the presidential election and defeated President Trump, the media don\u2019t have the power to decide the outcome of American elections. Legal challenges by the Trump reelection campaign, where I serve as a legal adviser, are still before the courts and we await judicial rulings on our challenges. In other words, as the late baseball great Yogi Berra said in 1973, referring to the National League pennant race: \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d We all want to know who will be president for the next four years. But all Americans should want accurate results above all, no matter who they supported in the race. GOP REP. DOUG COLLINS SAYS ELECTION FIGHT IS 'NOT OVER' So it\u2019s important for everyone to realize that Trump campaign legal challenges must be resolved in the courts before we have an official and legally binding decision on who won the 2020 presidential election. President Trump will continue fighting to ensure a fair and accurate election result. He is right to do this, because it\u2019s vital that we keep our elections free and fair. As Americans, we should all be able to recognize that our rule of law governs and our election process works accurately. For President Trump, the Trump 2020 campaign and the Republican National Committee, the rule of law, fundamental fairness and accuracy in election results are the goals. None of the legal fights we are waging are novel arguments or anything more than an effort to ensure a fair and accurate election outcome. Our nation went through a legal challenge to the results in Florida during the 2000 presidential election between then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore, for example. Twenty years ago, some news organizations prematurely said Gore won that very close election and would become the next president of the United States. Those news organizations later pulled back their projections. Legal challenges by the Bush campaign went all the way to the Supreme Court. The nation\u2019s highest court determined that George W. Bush won the election. Imagine how different history would have turned out if Bush has simply thrown in the towel as soon as he heard someone on TV say Gore won the race. Of course, from a political viewpoint, we prefer that the outcome of the election this year is a second term for President Trump. That\u2019s why we campaigned hard for the past four years up through Election Day. The legal challenges aren\u2019t campaigning. From a legal standpoint, politics and outcome preference do not matter. What matters is that everyone is required to play by the rules. Just like in sports, fans and teams obviously have an outcome preference \u2014 you want your own team to win. But that victory must be genuinely won according to the rules of the game. If any cheating happens, the outcome may be questioned or the results thrown out altogether. It\u2019s not a legitimate victory if rules are broken or one side cheats. What\u2019s happening right now is that the Biden camp is celebrating prematurely, without the results being finalized and legitimized. President Trump and his legal team are fighting to make sure that election results are accurate, according to the rules. Every American should agree with that and be able to have confidence in the integrity of the election. Twenty years ago, some news organizations prematurely said\u00a0 Al Gore won that very close election and would become the next president of the United States. It isn\u2019t a partisan or political statement to require that election results be legally accurate. It\u2019s a legal requirement. In our constitutional republic, we the people get to select our leaders according to the law and the Constitution, which govern our election results. Here\u2019s what we are fighting for currently \u2014 leaving all additional legal options open as we are still discovering new reports of ballot irregularities \u2014 and why it matters: 1 \u2014 Every legal vote must be counted accurately. The key word is \u201clegal.\u201d When members of the Biden camp assert that \u201cevery vote counts\u201d and leave out the key word \u201clegal\u201d they are inviting the likelihood that illegal ballots will be included in the final tally. The rule of law requires that any ballot that\u00a0fails to\u00a0meet the legal criteria should not be counted and any ballot that meets the legal criteria should be counted. Illegal ballots include duplicate ballots (people voting twice), manipulated ballots, spoiled ballots, late ballots, non-resident ballots, fraudulent ballots, and other\u00a0ballots that by law\u00a0must be legitimately excluded from the tally. Additionally, ballots that were improperly disqualified and excluded that are legal votes should be counted by law. This isn\u2019t a new concept magically appearing for this election. In every election, some ballots are challenged and thrown out as illegal. Challenging a ballot is not an attempt to manipulate the results \u2014 it\u2019s a call for accuracy in the results. 2 \u2014 Both sides are permitted by law to observe the counting of ballots to ensure honesty and transparency. Inexplicably, Republican poll watchers in multiple states are being denied meaningful access to observe the ballot counts. Not only is this illegal, but it sets up the results in these states to cause irreparable harm to both candidates. Without access by both camps, the results are presumptively invalid. President Trump can\u2019t prove that the ballot counting process was in fact fair and accurate. If Biden wants to claim victory in these precincts, he also can\u2019t prove that the results are fair and accurate. The law requires both sides to be able to observe the ballot counting in a manner that allows us to ensure fairness. Even in competitions where ballots are counted and where the results have far less impact than a presidential election, an observer from each team is allowed access to the tabulation room to inspect the ballots to ensure accuracy in the count. The only reason Team Trump would be denied access is for someone to manipulate the count or report inaccurate results. Ballots can be manipulated or thrown out. New ballots can be added. Other actions can be taken as well to undermine accurate election results. Any precincts not properly inspected for the full duration of the tabulating by a Republican observer should be presumptively invalid. There is simply no way for anyone to prove legitimacy and accuracy in the results by any reasonable standard. 3 \u2014 Legal challenges to unconstitutional processes and instances of irregularities and fraud must be resolved. The Trump campaign has challenged unconstitutional changes to states\u2019 election laws. In Pennsylvania, for example, the state Legislature has not acted to change the law. The state\u2019s governor cannot unilaterally change the law, nor can the state Supreme Court. The executive branch may only enforce the law, and the judicial branch may only interpret and apply the law and Constitution correctly to any legal challenge. Pennsylvania\u2019s executive branch attempted to change the deadline for receiving ballots to allow for three extra days, meaning that ballots could be counted if they were received as late as Friday. We in the Trump campaign argue that this action was unconstitutional. It doesn\u2019t matter if you think that\u2019s a good idea or not, or whether that benefits Trump or Biden. We believe it\u2019s illegal. The election in Pennsylvania is also complicated and the results likely irredeemably compromised because it is one of the states that has denied Team Trump meaningful access to observe the ballots counted. So although the U.S. Supreme Court has required segregation of late ballots from timely ballots, there is no way for anyone to prove that mixing of ballots or other fraud has not occurred. Additionally, once this kind or any other type of systematic fraud is shown to have occurred, the legal burden should shift to the state and the opposing candidate to prove that the fraud did not play a role in determining the outcome of the election. In other words, in this case the Biden campaign would need to show the fraud was on a small enough scale that it did not change the final result. With \u201cglitches\u201d in the system already showing thousands of ballots swinging to Biden that accurately reflected Trump, it\u2019s reasonable to require proof that the remaining results are in fact accurate in the precincts where these \u201cglitches\u201d occurred. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER 4 \u2014 Recounts must occur in states where a candidate leads by a razor-thin margin. Recounts happen regularly in close elections, and some are even automatic. It\u2019s highly suspicious that ballots are appearing and counting continuing in states until Joe Biden overcomes President Trump\u2019s lead, and that states appeared to halt their counts early on election night for no reason. In Georgia, for example, the very close tally demands a recount, while several thousand military ballots are still left to be counted. Ensuring fairness and accuracy requires that the ballots are recounted regardless of whether President Trump or Joe Biden remains slightly ahead at the end of the initial tally in Georgia. This election is unique only because the Trump campaign has raised multiple legal issues in multiple states about voting irregularities. It would be irresponsible for us to ignore all these irregularities and ignore what we believe are violations of the law. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Frankly, we don\u2019t know whether the results of this election can ever be legitimized as accurate. But we do know that we have raised legitimate questions that merit serious review by the courts. The bottom line is this: Everyone should be very careful assuming projected results are correct and that Joe Biden has won the election. We\u2019d be wise to remember the cautionary words of Yogi Berra: \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d And at this point, the race for the White House ain\u2019t over.

            "article_content": "Emily Larsen, Washington Examiner political reporter, weighs in on early voting on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' As the\u00a0presidential race\u00a0draws to a close,\u00a0President Trump\u00a0is slated to make a last-minute\u00a0appeal to voters in four battleground states with a dizzying number of campaign rallies while his\u00a0Democratic rival,\u00a0Joe Biden,\u00a0focuses heavily on Pennsylvania. After a campaign stop in Cleveland, Ohio, Biden will head to Pennsylvania for a canvassing event in Beaver County with union members and labor leaders; a drive-in rally in Pittsburgh to galvanize Black voters; and another drive-in event in Pittsburgh with Lady Gaga. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, will also be stumping across the state, with several planned campaign events culminating in a drive-in rally with John Legend in Philadelphia. 2020 ELECTION BALLOTS CAST SO FAR Both campaigns see Pennsylvania as crucial to securing the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the White House. Trump narrowly won the state in 2016 against Hillary Clinton\u00a0\u2012\u00a0part of the \"blue wall\" that he knocked down\u00a0\u2012\u00a0but polls consistently show Biden leading in the Keystone State. A new poll released Monday by Monmouth University found Biden with a seven\u00a0percentage point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania in\u00a0a high-turnout scenario, and a five\u00a0percentage point lead in a low-turnout scenario. But the Trump campaign views Pennsylvania as the most likely to flip red on Nov. 3, unlike Michigan and Wisconsin, where Biden holds a more comfortable lead. The president plans to campaign in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan twice. Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, will hold rallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania. An NBC/Wall Street Journal\u00a0poll\u00a0released Sunday shows Biden with a comfortable 10\u00a0percentage point lead\u00a0nationally, but the race is much\u00a0tighter in the key swing states candidates need to win to reach 270 electoral votes. CLAWING BACK VOTES: 7 STATES ALLOW VOTERS TO RESUBMIT BALLOTS Still, a\u00a0New York Times and Siena College poll published this week found Biden holds a clear advantage over Trump in four of the most critical battleground states, boosted by support\u00a0from voters who did not participate in the 2016 election. According to the poll, Biden is ahead of Trump in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as Arizona and Florida \u2014\u00a0states that Trump won four years ago. With 29\u00a0delegates up for grabs, Florida\u00a0is one of the biggest\u00a0prizes on Election Day.\u00a0Trump defeated\u00a0Hillary Clinton by 1.2 percentage points in Florida four years ago; if he\u00a0loses it\u00a0on Tuesday, his path to reelection would be considerably more difficult. More than 94\u00a0million Americans have already cast their ballots in the lead-up to the\u00a0Nov. 3 election, representing more than two-thirds of total voter turnout in the 2016 election, according to data provided by the University of Florida's Election Project. FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE CAST USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY Biden has previously expressed confidence in his odds of winning Wisconsin and Michigan and has also ventured into traditionally red states in the campaign's final weeks with trips to Iowa and Georgia. \u201cI am not overconfident about anything,\u201d\u00a0Biden told reporters one week ago.\u00a0\u201cI just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible.\u201d In the final leg of the campaign, Biden is seeking to frame the battle for the White House as a referendum on Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The candidate, following\u00a0a virtual briefing from public health officials, delivered a speech from Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday\u00a0addressing the virus-induced crisis. BIDEN MOVES ON COURT-PACKING STANCE, WHILE TRUMP SPARS WITH NBC IN DUELING TOWN HALLS \"Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I'm not running on the false promise of being to end this pandemic by flipping a switch,\" Biden said.\u201cI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.\u201d The virus has infected more than 9\u00a0million Americans and killed 231,003, the most in the world.",

            "article_content": " This has been a good week for Joe Biden.\u00a0His campaign stated that more than $80 million was raised in May, with an additional $6 million from a recent fundraiser with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and $3.5 million more raised with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Online contributions have risen as well, tripling over the past few weeks.\u00a0And although Biden\u2019s cash flow is less than half of the president\u2019s, in 2016 Donald Trump lost the money race but won the presidency. More good news for the former vice president is his rise in the polls against President Trump. Especially with women, who I believe will be the deciding factor in the November 2020 presidential election.\u00a0I know my colleague and friend Juan Williams says the black vote will decide both Biden and Trump\u2019s fate, but I disagree. BRIAN YABLONSKI: SAVING NATIONAL PARKS\u00a0\u2014 THIS BILL FUNDS PUBLIC LANDS NOW, AND FOR THE FUTURE Recent polling has found Biden ahead of Trump by 15 percent (Drudge Report) and many poo-poo those numbers and polls because Hillary Clinton was ahead in 2016 and lost. But when you look at Biden\u2019s lead, especially with female registered voters, he has historic high polling numbers among women voters. Biden\u2019s leading with female registered voters by 50 percent to 35 percent.\u00a0Clinton, a female herself had an advantage, but only 14 percentage points.\u00a0And, Biden\u2019s point margin among female voters has grown from 19 percent earlier this year to the 25-point margin he currently holds. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Back in 2016, the president only lost women over 45 by 3 percentage points and won over both white women and voters over 45 with 52 percent. But now, Trump\u2019s seeing support waning with women over 45. Biden is leading in this group by 17 points, up from 9 in March,\u00a0according to the latest ABC/Washington Post poll. And Biden\u2019s popularity with women is growing in swing battleground states. Although in 2016 Hillary had female support in states like Georgia, Iowa and Texas, Democrats knew they couldn\u2019t win those states. But the latest polls have Biden within striking distance. He is currently tied with Trump in Arkansas and there are whispers that Georgia might turn blue. In states like Wisconsin, where everything changed in 2016 in\u00a0Trump\u2019s favor, Hillary had a 10-point advantage with women over Trump, who only narrowly won that state. Today, Biden holds a 20-point lead with women in Wisconsin. In Virginia, he has a 21-point advantage over Trump with women and is also, although narrowly, leading Trump in Pennsylvania and Michigan with female voters. Why do so many women support Biden and why have so many of Trump\u2019s female supporters defected?\u00a0A few reasons. First, there is a backlash from female voters for Trump\u2019s handling (or lack of handling) if COVID-19. According to an NPR poll, 63 percent of women disapprove of the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. COVID has\u00a0upticked\u00a0in many states and in some places, like Miami, they\u2019re even delaying their plan to reopen due to Florida cases spiking. And that affects the economy, an\u00a0issue women\u00a0are very concerned about.\u00a0 Additionally, most recent polls show numbers as high as 70 percent of Americans even more concerned about a resurgence of the virus this fall and/or winter, women among them. The president is banking on his campaign for law and order, hoping to appeal to women voters in the very white suburbs, but I think this will backfire. More than 100,000 small businesses have permanently closed since March.\u00a0And women feel this impact not just because they\u2019re often the caretakers and homeschoolers, but also because many of them lost their jobs.\u00a0As C Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, put it: \u201cWe should go ahead and call this a \u2018she-cession.\u2019\u201d The stats back up that claim. Women accounted for 55 percent of the 20.5 million jobs lost in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\u00a0raising the unemployment rate for adult women to about 15 percent from 3.1 percent in February.\u00a0The unemployment rate for adult men was 13 percent. The president is banking on his campaign for law and order, hoping to appeal to women voters in the very white suburbs, but I think this will backfire. After the killing of George Floyd, for the first time in our nation, a significant majority of white Americans feel there is a great need for a systemic change. White\u00a0suburban\u00a0voters don\u2019t\u2019 want to be viewed as uneducated, racist or mean. Even some Republican women have said Trump hasn\u2019t risen to the occasion, hasn\u2019t kept his campaign promises,\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0support American values\u00a0and they\u2019re tired of him sounding like a\u00a05-year-old\u00a0with the\u00a0name-calling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The latest primaries were also a good sign of the strength of women for this coming November.\u00a0 In the eight states that held primaries, there were 122 women on the ballot and 56 of them were successful. In\u00a0California, the majority of the 27 that ran won as well. The next president of the United States will be another white guy, but it will be women who are the deciders this time around. And those female voters could be key to ejecting Donald Trump from the White House. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL",

This is the first survey of likely voters in the 2020 presidential election race by the Quinnipiac University Poll\u2026Democrats go to Biden 93 - 6 percent, Republicans go to Trump 90 - 8 percent, and independents back Biden 50 - 40 percent. Likely voters say 58 - 38 percent that the country is worse off than it was in 2016, the year of the last presidential election. Republicans say 84 - 15 percent the country is better off, Democrats say 95 - 4 percent it is worse off, and independents say 60 - 36 percent it is worse off. \u2026 Likely voters are split 48 - 48 percent when asked whether Biden or Trump would do a better job handling the economy.\u201dModerates, independents drive Biden lead -\u00a0KCCI: \u201cA new Grinnell College poll shows Joe Biden leading President Trump. The results were released Wednesday morning. The nationwide poll shows if the election were held today, Biden would win the popular vote 49-41%. The poll indicates Biden\u2019s support is strongest among women (56-34%), including a better than 2-to-1 margin among suburban women (64-31%). Biden also has a wide advantage among non-white voters (64-23%) and those who live in larger metropolitan areas (56-30% for Biden among city dwellers, 58-35% among those from the suburbs). \u2018Beyond the overall eight-point advantage, this poll shows some areas of underlying strength for the former vice president,\u2019 said\u00a0J. Ann Selzer\u00a0of Selzer & Company. \u2018Mr. Biden holds a wide lead with moderates 55-33%, who are a plurality of the electorate; he benefits from a 10-point lead among independents who do not lean toward any political party, 44-34%.\u2019\u201dAs race tightens, partisans more unwilling to accept results -\u00a0USA Today: \u201cThe political conventions over, Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in the race for the White House by 50%-43%, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds. That advantage narrowed from the 12-percentage-point edge he held in June. As Labor Day looms, launching the campaign's final sprint, the survey finds significant skepticism about whether the election can be trusted. If their candidate loses, one in four voters say, they aren't prepared to accept the outcome as fair and accurate \u2013 a signal of potential trouble ahead for a nation engulfed in a deadly pandemic and riven over issues of racial justice. \u2026 Twenty-eight percent of the former vice president's supporters say they aren't prepared to accept a Trump victory as fairly won; 19% of President Trump's supporters say they aren't prepared to accept a Biden victory as legitimate.\u201dPennsylvania getting close -\u00a0Monmouth University: \u201cJoe Biden holds a 4-point lead over Donald Trump among all registered voters in Pennsylvania according to the Monmouth University Poll. Among likely voters, the race is a tight 1 to 3 points, depending on the expected turnout level. This shift from Biden\u2019s larger lead just over six weeks ago is due to declining support for the challenger among men, voters under age 50, and voters in key swing counties. \u2026 Among all registered voters in Pennsylvania, the race for president stands at 49% for Biden and 45% for Trump. \u2026 Voter intent includes 43% who say they are certain to vote for Biden (versus 44% who say they are not at all likely to support the Democrat) and 40% who are certain to support Trump (versus 47% who are not at all likely).\u201d\n[Watch Fox:\u00a0New battleground state results from the Fox News polling team will be released at 6 pm ET on \u201cSpecial Report with\u00a0Bret Baier.\u201d]THE RULEBOOK: DON\u2019T LET \u2018EM FOOL YA\n\u201cThe king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute negative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament.

That\u2019s a funny concept to consider\u2014isn\u2019t popular music, definitionally, whatever\u2019s popular? In one sense, yes. But\u00a0pop\u00a0also refers to a compositional tradition, one with go-to chords, structures, and tropes. This type of pop prizes easily enjoyed melodies and sentiments; it moves but does not challenge the hips and the feet. It is omnivorous, and will spangle itself with elements of rock, rap, country, or whatever else it wants without losing its essential pop-ness. The early-2010s strain of it seemed like the height of irresistibility, and yet it\u2019s mostly faded away. There are many reasons for that, but they can all be reduced to what [Katy]\u00a0Perry\u2019s journey over the past decade has shown: Life and listening have become too complex for 2-D.

Biden's visit to Wisconsin comes just two days after President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0toured the destructive aftermath of the shooting of\u00a0Jacob Blake, who was shot seven times in the back by a police officer as he was trying to get into a vehicle. It's the first visit to Wisconsin by Biden this year, and the first to the state by a Democratic presidential nominee since 2012. \u2026 \u2018Vice President Biden will hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face,\u2019 his campaign said in a release. \u2018After, Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden will make a local stop.\u2019\u201dWants charges against killer cops -\u00a0Axios: \u201cJoe Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday that the police officers in Jacob Blake's shooting and\u00a0Breonna Taylor's murder \u2018need to be charged,\u2019 and called for an investigation into the individual who shot and killed a Trump supporter in Portland last weekend. Biden was asked about these situations after delivering remarks about how to open school safely in light of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes during a week in which he's been out on the trail countering Trump's attacks about violence and unrest in America. \u2018I think we should let the judicial system work its way,\u2019 Biden said when asked by a reporter if he agrees with his running mate, Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, that the officers who shot Blake and Taylor should be charged.\u201dBiden condemns rioters and looters in new law-and-order ad -\u00a0NYT: \u201cJoseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign unveiled a new television ad late Tuesday that packages portions of his speech on Monday in Pittsburgh condemning the sporadic violence that has erupted in some cities. The ad came as the former vice president pushes back against President Trump\u2019s efforts to define the Democrats as a party tolerant of lawlessness. Mr. Biden has repeatedly condemned instances in which protests for racial justice have burst into violence, accusing Mr. Trump of stoking divisions and laying blame for any chaos on the current occupant of the White House. But the ad \u2014 part of a $45 million one-week television and digital purchase that is by far the campaign\u2019s largest to date \u2014 is the first time that Mr. Biden has put this pushback on issues of crime and public safety into a major paid advertising program.\u201dKenosha business owner calls shenanigans on White House -\u00a0TMJ4: \u201cA Kenosha business owner is accusing President Donald Trump of using his destroyed store for political gain.\u00a0Tom Gram\u2019s century-old camera shop burned to the ground a week ago during the unrest in Uptown Kenosha.

He will meet with veterans and tour the battleship North Carolina, which took part in the major naval offensives in the Pacific. The ship was decommissioned in 1947 and now serves as a war memorial.\u201dYOUNG VOTERS, ELITES DROVE MARKEY VICTORYBoston Globe: \u201cRepresentative\u00a0Joseph P. Kennedy\u00a0III\u2019s loss to Senator\u00a0Edward J. Markey\u00a0in Tuesday\u2019s primary marked the first time a member of the storied political clan dropped an election in Massachusetts. \u2026\u00a0 \u2018Highly educated, high-income, high-wealth Democrats turned out to vote, and they turned out in droves to vote for Senator Markey,\u2019 [Tatishe Nteta, an associate professor of political science at UMass Amherst] said, noting Markey\u2019s success in areas like Brookline, Newton, Belmont, Northampton, and Amherst. Markey also took 59 percent of the vote in Boston, a nod to the changing demographics of the city, said\u00a0Lawrence S. DiCara, a former Boston city councilor\u2026 He said during the 2018 primaries, Boston precincts with the highest turnouts weren\u2019t the traditional ones associated with \u2018cops, firefighters, and nurses\u2019 in Dorchester, South Boston, and West Roxbury. Rather, he said, the Hyde Square corridor in Jamaica Plain, filled with young transplants, delivered victories to progressives such as Suffolk DA\u00a0Rachael Rollins\u00a0and Congresswoman\u00a0Ayanna Pressley.\u201dTop Pelosi lieutenant Neal fends off primary challenge -\u00a0AP: \u201cU.S. Rep.\u00a0Richard Neal\u00a0of Massachusetts, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, held off Democratic challenger\u00a0Alex Morse\u00a0in Tuesday\u2019s primary after an acrimonious campaign that included allegations of sexual misconduct leveled at his younger opponent. \u2026 The 71-year-old Neal \u2013 the longest-serving member of the state\u2019s all-Democratic congressional delegation \u2013 defeated 31-year-old Morse, seen as a political rising star after becoming one of Massachusetts\u2019 youngest and only openly gay mayors since becoming chief executive of Holyoke in 2011 at age 22. Both had collected high-profile endorsements in the last days of the campaign: Neal from House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0and Morse from U.S. Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0of New York. The race was marked by allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with students by Morse when he was an adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Morse insisted his relationships with college students were consensual. In mid-August, the university said it launched an independent review.\u201d\n\u00a0Too close to call in Brookline -\u00a0Boston Globe: \u201cThe Fourth Congressional District\u2019s crowded and oft-overshadowed Democratic primary trudged into Wednesday afternoon, narrowing to a two-way race that neither candidate was ready to call in their favor more than 17 hours after polls closed. Unofficial returns showed the primary\u2019s unwieldy field seeking to succeed Joseph P. Kennedy III had tightened at the top between\u00a0Jake Auchincloss, a Newton city councilor and Marine veteran, and\u00a0Jesse Mermell, a progressive former Brookline selectwoman, with Auchincloss holding a 1,506-vote lead \u2014 22.4 percent to Mermell\u2019s 21.4 percent \u2014 with 96 percent of precincts reporting. More than 148,000 ballots had been counted, with just one town, Franklin, having yet to report totals, according to unofficial results updated Wednesday afternoon.\u201dStill a historically bad year for incumbents -\u00a0FiveThirtyEight: \u201cTuesday notwithstanding, 2020 has still seen an unusual amount of anti-incumbent sentiment. The more-or-less final tally: Eight members of the House of Representatives (and no U.S. senators) lost renomination in 2020. Out of the 380 House members who ran for reelection this year, that may not seem like a lot. (And it isn\u2019t \u2014 incumbents have historically won their primaries at very high rates, and this year is no exception.) But it is an unusually high number by historical standards \u2014 it\u2019s twice as many as in 2018 or in the tea party cycle of 2010. It\u2019s not unusual to see a lot of incumbents lose primaries in years ending in -2 because those are the first cycles after congressional redistricting\u2026 But it is unusual to see a lot of incumbents lose in non-redistricting cycles like 2020, which have averaged only three incumbent losses since 1984.\u201dMNUCHIN TALKS UP RECOVERY, DOWNPLAYS HOPES OF A DEALAP: \u201cTreasury Secretary\u00a0Steven Mnuchin\u00a0spoke Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, urging a bipartisan deal expected to include a new round of stimulus checks but offering little in the way of concessions to restart talks between the GOP and Democrats. Pressed by Democrats to quickly negotiate a new coronavirus relief package, Mnuchin said Tuesday the administration remains willing to work on a bipartisan agreement to help small businesses, the unemployed, children and schools. Democratic leaders in Congress are holding it up with hardened positions, he said. \u2026 Mnuchin made the case that the economy\u2019s recovery has strengthened in recent weeks, citing improved consumer spending, growth in manufacturing and a rebounding housing market. Both Mnuchin and President Donald Trump have supported another round of stimulus checks for Americans as part of a second coronavirus relief bill, but with Congress at an impasse, the payments seem unlikely to come in the near future.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYU.S. debt on track to exceed the size of the economy\u00a0-\u00a0WSJGallup poll finds Americans\u2019 view of white-Black relations at new low\u00a0-\u00a0GallupSen.\u00a0Joni Ernst\u00a0suggests inflated statistics on coronavirus infections and deaths\u00a0-\u00a0APAUDIBLE: \u2018OPPORTUNITIES IN WORK CLOTHES\u2019\n\u201cDoom-scrolling through morbid headlines in 2020, one could easily believe that we have lost our capacity for effective crisis response.

            "article_content": "Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney joins 'Special Report' with the latest. The race for Iowa\u2019s Senate seat, the second-most expensive contest in U.S. history, is neck-and-neck and the outcome may decide which party wields more power in Washington after Election Day. Heated fights are underway for a number of Senate seats this year, and each one is critical for control of the upper chamber of Congress, which signs off on both cabinet nominations and judgeships. The Iowa seat could mean the difference between a Democratic sweep and Republicans retaining a majority. In Iowa, polls indicate enthusiasm has been building for incumbent GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, a former combat company commander. Her Democratic challenger -- Theresa Greenfield, a real estate developer -- holds a 1.5-point lead after three of the four most recent polls gave Ernst a slight edge, according to an average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics. Greenfield\u2019s advantage was 5 points on Oct. 8. \u201cEvery stop I make, I just feel a huge level of energy and enthusiasm,\u201d Ernst, who's seeking her second term, told Fox News from a Winnebago touring the state. \u201cI really think that momentum is on our side.\u201d SEN. ERNST HAS 'FULL SUPPORT' OF IOWA FARM BUREAU AFTER FAKE EMAIL SAYS OTHERWISE The importance of the contest is evidenced by the more than $200 million that has poured into the race, trailing only this year\u2019s competition in North Carolina for an all-time record. But the money isn\u2019t coming from Iowa. It is mostly coming from deep-pocketed donors on the east and west coasts of the country with more than $100 million going into Greenfield\u2019s coffers from ZIP codes in New York and California. Voters are seeing that New York City and San Francisco are \u201ctrying to influence the Iowa election,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cIowans are telling me they can't be bought.\u201d Greenfield for Iowa Communications Director Sam Newtown argues that his candidate's grassroots campaign is \u201cthe most expansive mobilization effort in Iowa Senate history\u201d and that it hasn\u2019t taken a \u201csingle dime from corporate PACs.\u201d IOWA SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH REPUBLICANS ON ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUESTS Both candidates have accused the other of accepting \u201cdark money\u201d and have been the subject of Federal Election Commission complaints. Greenfield has been accused of breaking campaign finance rules three times and flagged by the FEC over illegal contributions. A federal judge, meanwhile,\u00a0ordered the FEC to take action against a dark money group supporting Ernst. While accusations of campaign finance irregularities have the potential to influence voters, pocketbook issues and health concerns typically trump such matters. For Ernst, jobs and the economy are the No. 1 issue on the ballot. Moving the economy ahead \"safely and responsibly\" is pivotal, especially during the damaging COVID-19 pandemic. Farmers want to know that the renewable fuel standard program will be protected, she added, and that the U.S. will have strong trade deals to secure their exports. While Midwest farmers have benefited from government assistance, many were hurt by the loss of Chinese markets for their crops after President Trump began a trade war with Beijing. CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC CAR PLAN CRUSHES IOWA FARMERS IN MOVE TOWARD GREEN NEW DEAL Ernst also said Iowans want to know that they are adequately protected, which means \u201cnot defunding the police.\u201d Greenfield, meanwhile, has said U.S. law enforcement has been built on \u201csystemic racism\u201d while noting that not all police officers are racist. She thinks officers should undergo racial bias and de-escalation\u00a0training and that chokeholds should be banned. The use of neck restraints has come under increasing scrutiny following the death of George Floyd, a Black man being taken into custody by Minneapolis police in late May, and the resulting racial justice protests. Greenfield, who has railed against the Trump administration's\u00a0handling of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, has also stressed the importance of strengthening the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare, by creating a public option to heighten competition and bring down prices. \u201cHealth care is the number one issue on the ballot in November,\u201d Greenfield said at the first debate between the two candidates. \u201cIowans have preexisting conditions\" and they want to keep ObamaCare's protections for such medical issues, she added. The Trump administration has fought continuously to wipe out ObamaCare, though the president has promised that preexisting conditions would continue to be covered, something that Ernst also supports. How that would happen is unclear, since the administration hasn't introduced a comprehensive health care plan of its own. After the polls close and as the votes are tallied, Americans sitting at home watching should be mindful of the Iowa map. The metro areas around Ames, Des Moines and Iowa City are liberal-leaning and the winner may be determined by who fares better in the rural parts of the state, the counties that Ernst says Greenfield has neglected. Results from those areas typically take longer to come in. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ernst says she has visited all 99 counties in the state and that her opponent has traveled to fewer than half. \u201cI think that will matter tremendously,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cWe'll see those rural areas put me over that finish line.\u201d",

            "article_content": " The Trump campaign\u00a0said it is filing\u00a0a\u00a0federal lawsuit in Las Vegas Thursday, suing to stop the counting of what it calls\u00a0\u201cillegal votes\u201d in Nevada, claiming to have evidence that people who are deceased and nonresidents have cast ballots in the 2020 election. The campaign announced\u00a0the lawsuit during a news conference in Las Vegas Thursday morning.\u00a0Former Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp and Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald\u00a0hosted the press conference. PRESIDENTIAL RACE UNDECIDED: WHERE THINGS STAND AFTER BIDEN WINS MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN The Trump campaign alleges there are \"tens of thousands\" of people who voted in Nevada who are no longer state residents. The campaign said it is not seeking to stop the vote\u00a0but rather\u00a0ensure that\u00a0every \u201clegal\u201c vote is counted\u00a0and that no \u201cillegal\u201d votes are counted. \"We are confident that when all legal votes are tallied -- and only legal votes are tallied -- President Trump will win the state of Nevada,\u201d Grenell told Fox News. A source familiar with the lawsuit told Fox News that campaign officials have proof that people who have died have been found to have voted. The source told Fox News that Nevada election officials have not provided answers to the campaign as to why they haven\u2019t had a \u201ccheck\u201d on mail ballots, which the campaign alleges\u00a0were sent to apartments where individuals no longer lived\u00a0but were filled out and cast. The source added that there has been \u201cno observation for signature matches whatsoever\u201d and said, in general, there have not been observers watching the counting \u2014 specifically in Clark County. \"We have proof they are counting illegal votes,\"\u00a0the source said. During the news conference, Grenell Thursday said \u201ctransparency is not political.\u201d \u201cBallots are not automatically legal votes until they are checked,\u201d Grenell said. \u201cWe are not being allowed to check.\u201d Grenell said there is public information that nonresidents have voted and broken Nevada law, which requires a 30-day residency int he state to vote. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been in the state for 30 days, it is illegal to vote,\u201d Grenell said. \u201cThe fact is, we are filing this federal lawsuit to protect legal voters.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is unacceptable in this country to have illegal votes counted, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the state of Nevada.\u201d Grenell noted that counties have not offered answers to how they are counting \u201cillegal votes,\u201d calling it \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and saying it gives \u201clegal people a sense that the system is corrupt.\u201d \u201cWe have to have as system where legal votes are cast,\u201d Grenell added. Meanwhile, Schlapp said that the situation in Nevada \u201cimpacts what is going on all across the country.\u201d \u201cThe presidency hangs in the balance,\u201d Schlapp said. The press conference included an older woman, who claimed that she and her roommate were sent ballots in the mail\u2014 both of which were stolen. \u201cI always voted in person, this time, they mailed out the ballot and somebody took my ballot,\u201d she said. \u201c\u201dThey also took the ballot of my roommate.\u201d The woman added that when she went to vote in person, she was told that she already had cast a ballot. Nevada, with its\u00a0six electoral votes, has become a key battleground state in the 2020 race \u2014 one that has yet to declare a winner. NEVADA VOTE COUNT TO CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY Nevada Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Cegavske tried Wednesday to\u00a0address voter frustration as Americans across the country watched to see which way Nevada would lean. The secretary\u2019s office encouraged patience and said the ballot counting process was \u201cproceeding at the expected pace\u201d and that it\u00a0would not be releasing any more ballot results until Thursday morning. The state\u2019s election office also confirmed it had not stopped counting since it started and intended to keep tallying votes throughout Wednesday night. \u201cThe timeline for counting ballots in Nevada comes from the legislatively approved process, and this process dictates that all properly received ballots will continue to be counted for up to nine days after the election,\u201d the office said in a statement Wednesday night. With 76% reporting as of\u00a0Thursday, Biden led the Nevada race by 11,458\u00a0votes, an advantage of\u00a01%\u00a0over Trump. The Trump 2020 campaign made it clear it would demand a recount in any state that it lost within a 1% margin or less. Fox News' Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.

READ THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS With four and a half months to go until the November general election \u2013 which can be an eternity in campaign politics \u2013 the poll indicates that, right now, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads Trump 50-36 percent among registered voters nationwide. The survey is the latest national poll to show\u00a0the former vice president\u00a0topping the GOP incumbent in the White House by double digits. A Fox News Poll released last week showed Biden ahead of the president by 12 percentage points and a CNN survey from earlier this month put the margin at 14 points. Other surveys indicate a single-digit advantage for Biden. An average of the most recent national polls compiled by RealClearPolitics puts Biden ahead of the president by 10.2 points. But that\u2019s double the roughly 5 point advantage the former vice president held over Trump in the average of national surveys in mid-May. The president has railed against the polls \u2013 and his reelection campaign earlier this month slammed the CNN poll as \u201cphony.\u201d \u201cNew York Times poll is based off of registered voters, not likely voters,\"\u00a0Trump campaign deputy press secretary Ken Farnaso told Fox News in response\u00a0to the Siena College poll. \"And on top of that, our numbers have continuously shown President Trump running extremely strong against a defined Joe Biden. 2016 proved that the President\u2019s ability to connect with the American people is unmatched.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN But Biden\u2019s lead is larger than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s 6 to 7 point advantage at this point in the 2016 presidential election cycle, according to the RealClearPolitics average. And while Trump was the outsider and disrupter in 2016, he\u2019s now the incumbent president running on his record and how\u2019s he\u2019s handled the coronavirus pandemic, reigniting an economy flattened by the outbreak, and on the racial unrest that\u2019s swept the nation in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of the police. \"The bottom line is Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton. In 2016, the race was a lot about Hillary Clinton. Right now this race is about Donald Trump,\u201d noted veteran GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. \u201cIf it remains a referendum on Donald Trump, we\u2019re going to lose that.\u201d Clinton topped Trump in the vast majority of national polls in the summer and autumn of 2016. But the margins narrowed and the final national poll average heading into the November election put Clinton ahead of Trump by 2.1 points, which was the percentage she ended up winning the national popular vote. But as any political science or American history student can tell you, the race for the White House is not a national popular vote, but rather a battle for the states and their electoral votes, and Trump smoked Clinton in the 2016 electoral vote count, thanks to narrow victories in key battleground states. Right now Biden has a single-digit edge over Trump in 4 of the 5 most crucial swing states, according to averages of the latest public opinion polling in those states. Newhouse \u2013 who was Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s pollster in the 2012 presidential campaign \u2013 acknowledged that national polls aren\u2019t \u201cnecessarily indicative of how the race is going to end up.\u201d But he emphasized that \u201cthe national polls are still an indicator of where we are in some of these individual states. A rising tide lifts all boats. If we\u2019re down 14 points nationally, we\u2019re probably not right now within striking distance in Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin or some of these other key states.\u201d Polls also indicate that Biden isn\u2019t nearly as unpopular as Clinton was in 2016 \u2013 which is another problem for a president who\u2019s favorable ratings and approval ratings are underwater. Pointing to efforts already underway by the president, his campaign, and allied outside groups, Newhouse said the key for Trump is to try and turn the tables and make the general election more about the Democratic challenger. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to smoke Joe Biden out. Voters have got to understand more about his record and who he is,\u201d Newhouse told Fox News. \u201cWe have to fill in the blanks on him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Voter outreach on college campuses is a big challenge for Democrats amid the pandemic \u2013 in part because a lot of students aren't there. Millions of dollars have been spent so far on three congressional campaigns in hotly contested Virginia districts\u00a0 -- with one surpassing even the 2020 presidential campaigns and another close behind. Advertising in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District topped $11 million earlier this week, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit, nonpartisan\u00a0organization. The 2nd District racked up more than $8 million. Those races are roughly in the ballpark of the combined costs of advertising for President Trump and Joe Biden, which total more than $9 million. VIRGINIA SENATE DEBATE SEES WARNER, GADE GLASH ON TRUMP, RACE, HEALTH CARE \u201cI believe it\u2019s one of the most expensive congressional races in the country already,\u201d Joe Desilets, the campaign manager for the 7th District\u2019s GOP candidate Nick Freitas told Fox News Thursday. \u201cJust on TV and radio, there\u2019s over $13 million between past and future spending in this election, and obviously there\u2019s a ton more in mail, digital, and other campaign spending.\u201d Recent polls show him neck-and-neck with incumbent Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is serving her first term after flipping the district in 2018. Freitas\u2019 campaign and supportive PACs have spent more than $4.4 million so far, compared to Spanberger\u2019s $6.6 million.\u00a0But Freitas is breaking GOP fundraising records, according to Desilets. \u201cWe feel great about where the race is right now, and it\u2019s clear that the Democrats are increasingly worried,\u201d Desilets said. \u201cEvery time we turn around, they add another million dollars in attack ads.\" VIRGINIA SENATE RACE SEES UNDERDOG GOP CHALLENGER CONFIDENT DESPITE UPHILL BATTLE Spanberger, a former federal law enforcement officer and ex-CIA case officer, is the first Democrat to win election in the district since 1968. This combination of Sept. 29, photos shows President Donald Trump, left, and former Vice President Joe Biden during the first presidential debate at Case Western University and Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) While at least three congressional races in the state are close, polls show Biden with an advantage in the presidential race. Virginia went to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and no Republican has won a statewide election there since 2009. Still,\u00a0ads supporting Biden have cost more than $6 million, roughly double what the other side has spent. That combined total is barely ahead of the $8 million spent in the 2nd District race between incumbent Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria and GOP challenger Scott Taylor. Like Spanberger, Luria is serving her first term. She narrowly won the seat from Taylor two years ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The 5th District race between Dr. Cameron Webb and Bob Good is also tight, with spending at around $4 million between the two camps. The state\u2019s Democratic Party summed the situation up simply in an email soliciting donations Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit our fundraising goals every month this year, but here\u2019s the thing: so have the Republicans.\u201d Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

He will be the first Delawarean to be a major-party nominee, and will face the first Floridian to be atop a ticket.\nDespite a screwy coronavirus schedule, Biden clinched the nomination in the first week of June, just like every other winner of a contested Democratic nomination since 1980 \u2013 except for\u00a0John Kerry\u2019s 2004 blowout of\u00a0Howard Dean, which wrapped up in March.\nAt 77 years and 9 months, Biden will be by far the oldest person Democrats have nominated in the party\u2019s 192-year history. Only four other times have Democrats nominated someone over age 65. The closest to Biden was\u00a0Hillary Clinton, aged 68 years, 9 months when she won four years ago.President Trump\u00a0will be 74 years and 2 months of age when he is re-nominated, making him the oldest person ever to win the Republican mantle \u2013 a year older than both\u00a0Bob Dole\u00a0in 1996 and\u00a0Ronald Reagan\u00a0in 1984. Alert to early bird buffet enthusiasts: The major-party competitors this year will be the oldest duo in American electoral history with a combined age of nearly 152 years.Biden in many ways exceeded expectations in his victory. Despite a persistent polling lead since his entry into the race, his grim performance in the first three contests in February for a time seemed disqualifying. Combined with an uneasy manner on the stump, weak fundraising and the reticence of the Democratic establishment to embrace one of its own, Biden\u2019s path to the nomination seemed perilous.\nBut on the other hand, how surprised should anyone be that the popular former vice president from a popular previous administration would do well? Though it was hard to remember at times, Biden was the heavy favorite all along.Now that Biden, who ran for president twice before and has been a national political figure since 1972, has captured the prize that for so long eluded him, what\u2019s he going to do\u00a0with it?On the sunny side of the street for Biden is that he is running ahead of where Clinton was against Trump four years ago, both nationally and in battleground states. Biden today leads Trump by 8.4 points nationally. At this point four years ago, Clinton was up by 2.6 points. Better still for Biden, his polling average is over 50 percent, something Clinton did not accomplish once after March 2016.And as a\u00a0survey of battleground state voters\u00a0from the WSJ/NBC News today reinforces, Biden has the edge in key states, leading Trump by a combined 8 points in\u00a0Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nThe issue set also currently favors Biden, with persistent concerns about a public health crisis, racial unrest and a deepening sense of unease about the direction of the country \u2013 never good for the person seeking re-election. No incumbent since\u00a0George H.W. Bush\u00a0has looked so vulnerable.\nWhere the clouds gather for Biden, though, is in his own party.\nOne of the reasons Clinton fared so poorly against Trump in 2016 was that she was so heavily favored to win \u2013 to the point of irrational invincibility. It was largely her doing, with a campaign that was badly detached and focused too much on Clinton\u2019s historic status. It was \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d instead of \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d\nBut because of this invincibility myth and Clinton\u2019s own prickly persona and personal baggage, Democratic voters showed little enthusiasm for her cause and were quite willing to undercut her candidacy for their own gains. Biden, who benefitted hugely from Democrats\u2019 rush to unify this spring, could yet face Clinton\u2019s headaches.If far-left Democrats think Biden can\u2019t lose, they will feel less compunction about making impossible demands of the nominee, like supporting defunding police departments or Medicare for all, both swing state suicides. Biden got a bunch of breaks, especially from\u00a0Bernie Sanders, because he looked weak. Will that change as Biden looks stronger?The other challenge for Biden will be in controlling himself. Watching the way Biden reacted to Trump\u2019s initial attacks on his son\u00a0Hunter\u2019s personal and professional train wrecks made it obvious to anyone that he is not prepared for what\u2019s to come.\nBiden has a bad habit of losing his temper. The attacks that he is going to face in the next five months will be savage. While Trump\u2019s allies in the Senate cook Hunter over an open fire, Biden will also face Trump\u2019s prodigious and dedicated troll army. Biden will find himself and his family accused of every crime and misdeed imaginable.\nIf Trump gets Biden\u2019s Irish up well enough, he can keep his challenger off balance and keep the media\u2019s focus on whatever controversies, real or imagined, that call Biden\u2019s character and fitness into doubt. Debate moderators better keep a hose handy when these two old dogs start barking at each other on stage.\nBiden is an unlikely nominee in many ways, but he has been extraordinarily lucky so far. We\u2019ll see if he can keep it up.THE RULEBOOK: USER FRIENDLY REPUBLIC\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt will be my aim to remove the obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done, without sacrificing utility to despatch.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 15TIME OUT: THE GREAT HOME RUN CHASEESPN: \u201cIs 22 years too soon? How do we look back on the great Home Run Chase of 1998? Can we look past the uncomfortable aftermath and remember\u00a0Mark McGwire's battle with\u00a0Sammy Sosa\u00a0for home run supremacy as a jubilant summer? \u2026 Or maybe you have a forgiving memory and fondly recall when the biggest story in sports was a baseball story. \u2026 The most-watched regular-season game in ESPN history with 10.6 million viewers remains the Cubs-Cardinals game from Sept. 7, when McGwire tied\u00a0Roger Maris' record with his 61st home run. \u2026 The narrative that the Home Run Chase saved baseball, however, was misleading even at the time. After attendance dropped 20% in 1995 following the 1994 strike, it increased 6% in 1996 and 5% in 1997, but just 4% in 1998 and actually declined slightly in 1999. \u2026 In a sense then, it really was just about the chase for the most hallowed record in sports.\u201dFlag on the play?\u00a0- Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\u00a0\u00a0NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE\u00a0Trump:\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0Biden:\u00a050.2 percent\u00a0Size of lead:\u00a0Biden by 8.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0First week of average[Average includes: CNN: Trump 41% - Biden 55% ; NBC News/WSJ: Trump 42% - Biden 49%; NPR/PBS/Marist: Trump 43% - Biden 50%; IBD: Trump 42% - Biden 49%; Monmouth University: Trump 41% - Biden 52%.]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(186 electoral votes)\u00a0Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(249 electoral votes)[Full rankings\u00a0here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\u00a041.8 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a054.2 percentNet Score:\u00a0-12.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2193\u00a02.2 points[Average includes: CNN: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 42% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 42% approve - 52% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 54% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The proposed legislation would revise the federal criminal police misconduct statute to make it easier to prosecute officers who are involved in misconduct \u2018knowingly or with reckless disregard.\u2019 The package would also change \u2018qualified immunity\u2019 protections for police \u2018to enable individuals to recover damages when law enforcement officers violate their constitutional rights.\u2019\u201dTrump, local leaders step back from standoff -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cA day after thousands of people filled the streets of Washington and other cities to demand action against police brutality and systemic racism, local and national figures on Sunday moved to further de-escalate tensions, with President Trump pulling back the National Guard and more cities \u2014 including New York, Philadelphia and Chicago \u2014 lifting curfews. As Americans again turned out for what researchers are calling the most sweeping and sustained protests in the country\u2019s history, the steps taken by leaders in Washington and elsewhere were a reflection of the fact that the demonstrations, which were initially marked by confrontations and violence, have become more peaceful even as several cities saw their largest ever crowds. Trump announced Sunday morning that he was ordering National Guard troops to begin withdrawing from the nation\u2019s capital, the morning after more than 10,000 people marched through the District in what was mostly a festive day of demonstrations.\u201dPOLL: 67 PERCENT SAY TRUMP WORSENED RACIAL TENSIONNPR: \u201cAs the country erupts in protests over police brutality and racism, two-thirds of Americans think\u00a0President Trump\u00a0has increased racial tensions in the U.S., according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. \u2026 Overall, 67% said Trump has mostly increased racial tensions, including 92% of Democrats, 73% of independents, 88% of Africans Americans and 63% of whites. \u2026 Trump's approval rating is 41% in the poll. That's about where it has been since he took office. It's down 2 points since March, the last time the poll measured his overall approval rating, but his overall disapproval number jumped 5 points to 55%. \u2026 As his disapproval shifts, Trump is falling short in the head-to-head matchup in the November election with [Joe]\u00a0Biden. The former vice president leads Trump, according to the poll, 50% to 43%.\u201dVoters increasingly alarmed about direction of nation -\u00a0NBC News: \u201cEight out of 10 voters believe that things are out of control in the United States, with majorities still concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, pessimistic about the economy's returning to normal before next year and down on President Donald Trump's ability to unite the nation. \u2026 Despite the turmoil and instability, the NBC News/WSJ poll shows that attitudes about Trump and the 2020 election remain locked in place, with the president's job rating stuck in the mid-40s and with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden maintaining his national lead over Trump. \u2026 When it comes to the presidential contest in November, Biden leads Trump nationally by 7 points among all registered voters, 49 percent to 42 percent \u2014 unchanged from April's poll.\u201dApproval his new low -\u00a0CNN: \u201cA new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS finds Trump's approval rating down 7 points in the last month as the President falls further behind presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, whose support now stands at its highest level in CNN polling. \u2026 Overall 38% approve of the way Trump is handling the presidency, while 57% disapprove. \u2026 In the race for the White House, among registered voters, Trump stands 14 points behind Biden, who officially secured enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination in CNN's delegate estimate on Saturday. The 41% who say they back the President is the lowest in CNN's tracking on this question back to April 2019, and Biden's 55% support is his highest mark yet.\u201dBLACK WOMEN GET NEW ATTENTION AS POTENTIAL VEEPSPolitico: \u201cWide-scale protests that have exposed deep racial tensions across the nation in the last two weeks are reshaping the contours of Joe Biden\u2019s search for a vice presidential pick, sharpening the focus on an African American woman as his running mate and elevating the prospects of several candidates once viewed as longshots. ... In the last week alone, two prospects who were initially not considered among the top tier contenders have suddenly burst into contention: Atlanta Mayor\u00a0Keisha Lance Bottoms\u00a0and Florida Rep.\u00a0Val Demings. Both have been tapped by the Biden campaign to act as leading surrogates amid the unrest and have seen their national media exposure intensify. Bottoms is being vetted as a Biden running mate, two sources with knowledge of the discussions confirm to POLITICO. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, has previously confirmed she\u2019s being vetted.\u201dKamala Harris tries to seize the moment -\u00a0Politico: \u201c[Kamala] Harris spent the campaign and months since working to burnish her image on criminal justice issues and contending that her decades in the field, which were viewed as a liability, instead provides her with unmatched perspective into how to achieve systemic change. Since the uprising over the killing of George Floyd, she\u2019s taken to cable news programs and the Senate floor to argue for police reform and reconciliation. Harris' increasing comfort with leading on justice issues \u2014 and success at convincing progressive advocates that her efforts are sincere \u2014 might well have happened whether or not she was in the running to become Joe Biden's running mate.\u201dEXPERIMENTS WITH CYBER VOTING RAISE NEW WORRIESNYT: \u201cWith the general election less than 150 days away, there are rising concerns that the push for remote voting prompted by the pandemic could open new opportunities to hack the vote \u2014 for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but also others hoping to disrupt, influence or profit from the election. President Trump has repeatedly said that mail-in ballots invite voter fraud and would benefit Democrats. It is a baseless claim: Mail-in voting has resulted in little fraud in the five states that have used it for years, and a recent study at Stanford University found that voting by mail did not advantage either party and might increase voter turnout for both parties. But there are different worries. The rush to accommodate remote voting is leading a small number of states to experiment with or expand online voting, an approach the Department of Homeland Security deemed \u2018high risk\u2019 in a report last month.\u201dAbrams leads charge to counter GOP vote-by-mail fraud claims -\u00a0AP: \u201cDemocrats are mounting a new effort to push back against a well-funded Republican campaign that seeks to undermine public confidence in mail-in voting, which President Donald Trump has said, without offering proof, will lead to election fraud. Fair Fight, an organization led by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Stacey Abrams, has joined forces with Priorities USA, the largest Democratic outside group, and American Bridge, the party\u2019s opposition research clearinghouse, to form a new effort called Voter Suppression Watch. The aim is to not only counter Republicans in the courts but in public relations, too, while playing offense by providing opposition research that often forms the grist of critical news stories.\u201dTRUMP CAMPAIGN LOOKS FOR WARMER WORDSAxios: \u201cPresident Trump's top political advisers, in a private meeting last week, said their boss needs to add more hopeful, optimistic and unifying messages to balance his harsh law-and-order rhetoric. They're deeply concerned about \u2018brutal\u2019 internal polling for the president in the aftermath of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and\u00a0George Floyd's killing. \u2026 Advisers settled on a theme of the \u2018Great American Comeback\u2019 underpinned by words like \u2018renewing,\u2019 \u2018recovering,\u2019 \u2018restoring\u2019 and \u2018rebuilding.\u2019 Friday's surprisingly good jobs report gave them a chance to road test the theme with a new ad: \u2018The great American comeback has begun. ... Renewing. Restoring. Rebuilding. Together, we'll make America great again.\u2019 \u2026 A source briefed on his internal polls called them \u2018brutal,\u2019 showing a significant drop-off in independent support.\u201dGOP old guard goes silent on Trump -\u00a0NYT: \u201cThe 2020 campaign is different: Opposing the sitting president of your own party means putting policy priorities at risk, in this case appointing conservative judges, sustaining business-friendly regulations and cutting taxes \u2014 as well as incurring the volcanic wrath of Mr. Trump. \u2026 Former President\u00a0George W. Bush\u00a0won\u2019t support the re-election of Mr. Trump, and\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019ll vote\u2026 Senator\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0of Utah won\u2019t back Mr. Trump\u2026 And former Secretary of State\u00a0Colin Powell\u00a0announced on Sunday that he will vote for Mr. Biden\u2026 None of these Republicans voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but the reproach of big Republican names carries a different weight when an incumbent president and his shared agenda with Senate leaders are on the line. Former Republican leaders like the former Speakers\u00a0Paul D. Ryan\u00a0and\u00a0John A. Boehner\u00a0won\u2019t say how they will vote\u2026\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYLeft wing Dems getting skunked in Senate primaries\u00a0-\u00a0PoliticoNorth Carolina Republicans push to keep convention\u00a0-\u00a0APU.S. allies in Europe worried about Trump\u2019s move to pull troops from Germany\u00a0-\u00a0WSJRomney takes part in D.C. protest\u00a0-\u00a0NBC NewsAUDIBLE: HUSKED OFF\u201cIt\u2019s bullsh** the way people grandstand for cameras in here\u2026 The Senate doesn\u2019t work\u2026 90 percent of our committees are about people trolling for soundbites.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Ben Sasse, R-Neb., at a Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0hearing\u00a0Thursday.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cInterestingly, Candidate Biden has estimated that ten to fifteen percent of our population are probably \u2018just not very good people.\u2019 From my read, the population of the United States in 2015 was estimated to be 316,515,021; accordingly, that means anywhere between 31.6 and 47.4 million Americans fall into this category. Most would agree that's a lot of bad guys. Curiously, it seems he offered no criteria by which he arrived at this conclusion. It is high time a capable and competent journalist, and yes, I have you in mind... inquires of him just how he determined who is good and who is not very good. If he has a listing, he should make it public so we know who to stay away from. Similarly, wouldn't all 100 percent of us want to know if we're on his short list? The tragic events of the last few weeks are much too serious for any candidate of any party to pander to the masses without backing up their pontification.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James W. Herzog,\u00a0Spartanburg, S.C.\n[Ed. note: Oh, now, Mr. Herzog\u2026 I think that this time around we can all be forgiven for taking much of what both parties\u2019 nominees say neither literally nor seriously. Both Biden and Trump are absolute woodchippers of American English, and both have strong tendencies to bloviate braggadociously, including on subjects about which they have little to no actual knowledge.\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0meant with precision that she thought about half of Donald Trump's supporters were racists or in some other way \u201cdeplorable.\u201d She had clearly thought that one out and her disdain was purposeful. But when Biden talks, it\u2019s like trying to pull an old Pontiac into traffic. There\u2019s a little hesitation, the engine coughs to life and then roars wildly up the road with occasional backfires. And when he tries to stop, he often finds he has no brakes and just tries to bang into the curb as softly as possible. Other times, he wraps himself around a tree trunk. I\u2019m not going to wear myself out imbuing deeper meanings to a guy who can barely keep it on the road. The same goes for Trump, who is the\u00a0Paula Deen\u00a0of political rhetoric. Everything can be buttered, battered, fried, rolled in Cool Ranch Doritos and sprinkled with bacon. We sometimes forget the degree of his rhetorical excesses, wild exaggerations and solipsism because he maintains his verbal assault in such a sustained way. It fades into a kind of aural wallpaper. I will leave it to partisans to pick through the mulch these guys leave behind to find things about which to be offended.]\n\u201cMy head is spinning with all that is going on, but the racial issue is one that I\u2019m surprised that we haven\u2019t made more progress. After watching many of the videos the past couple weeks it\u2019s obvious we have an issue with policing. After listening to the founder of BET describe his reasoning for reparations, how\u00a0Drew Brees\u00a0was treated after sharing his feelings on kneeling for the flag (which I thought was very reasonable) and not much leadership from anyone, I\u2019m not sure a conversation can be had that will result in any common ground. Seems we have to totally agree with one side and one side only. For the record, I\u2019m a white male in my 40\u2019s living in a small midwestern town with little diversity. With that said, we still have neighborhoods that need help. My suggestion would be to press our local councils/government to reallocate funds so every neighborhood isn\u2019t left out and we do simple things like fines for city ordinance violations. Jail isn\u2019t the answer for every violation, save that for real criminals. I completely agree with you and Jonah on adding to the House of Representatives, any way we can make all levels of government more local we should.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Trent Aschliman, Ossian, Ind.[Ed. note: I don\u2019t think being a white dude from Indiana is somehow disqualifying from your participation in important national debates. But I do agree that in any debate, acknowledging how one\u2019s own experiences shape their perceptions is a good place to start for people of good faith. The other good thing to do is define the area of discussion. Are we talking about police brutality against black Americans? Are we talking about racism writ large? Or inequality of opportunity? It\u2019s hard to have a fruitful debate if both sides don\u2019t agree on what they\u2019re debating. And I think that\u2019s a lot of what\u2019s going on here. We will not solve the problems of black America by stopping police brutality alone, but for many black Americans, this has become the test of the validity of the system. This perhaps increases the chance of fruitful discussion if it becomes a debate over specific reforms or legislation. On the other hand, it may just be another instance of people saying we need to have a discussion and then just wishing the other guy would shut up already.

Re: Friday's Word from Charles: Not a year has gone by since 1963 that I have not repeated the words from Dr. King's landmark speech. For me it is not a dream, but a way of life.

Seeing the humanity in everyone can be so hard when we live in a dehumanizing world. People are reduced to labels -- left, right, black, white, red, blue -- so that they can be ignored, scorned and marginalized without a second thought.

Though I\u2019m not sure which curio is more curious, the industrial jargon or philosophical\u2026]\u00a0\u201cIn your opinion, there is anyone who decries the use of force against looters who really and truly believes that the improvement of race relations is to be found in the smoldering ruins of a store or police car?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Richard O.

It\u2019s pretty weak sauce. The overwhelming majority of Americans support the right of peaceful protest and oppose violence in pursuit of any agenda.

A Belgian man says he has been receiving mysterious pizzas that he never ordered for over a decade. While it may initially seem like an annoying prank, the victim says he\u2019s received so many pizzas over the years that he shakes every time he hears a scooter coming down the street.\u00a0Jean Van Landeghem, a 65-year-old resident of Turnhout, says delivery drivers bring pizza to his door at all hours and the day and night, the Independent reports. This has reportedly been going on for almost a decade and Landeghem says he has no idea why. Initially, he reportedly believed that there was some sort of mistake with his address and the correct delivery address. Unfortunately, the food kept arriving, sometimes even multiple times in the same day. \u2026 Adding another odd layer to the mystery is the fact that one of Landeghem\u2019s friends, who lives 20 miles away, has reportedly also been suffering from similar mystery deliveries. This had led authorities to believe that the culprit must be someone the two men both know. Unfortunately, for now, the cause remains a mystery.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cEnvy for America, resentment of our power, hatred of our success has been a staple for decades, but most particularly since victory in the cold war left us the only superpower.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Charles Krauthammer\u00a0(1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 9, 2003.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

President Trump won the district in 2016 by about 8 percentage points.

She described House Democrats' election results as a \"failure\" during the party's caucus call on Thursday. \u201cI think that we need to be pretty clear about the fact that Tuesday, from a congressional standpoint, it was a failure. It was not a success,\u201d Spanberger said on the call, according to audio obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cWe hear colleagues come and go.

(Photo by Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) She cited her party's decision to support socialism and the Defund the Police movement as a key reason for many Democratic candidates struggling on Election Day. \"The number one concern in things that people brought to me in my [district] that I barely re-won, was defunding the police,\" Spanberger said. \"And I've heard from colleagues who have said 'Oh, it's the language of the streets. We should respect that.' We're in Congress. We are professionals. We are supposed to talk about things in the way where we mean what we're talking about. If we don't mean we should defund the police, we shouldn't say that.\" \"We want to talk about funding social services, and ensuring good engagement in community policing, let's talk about what we are for,\" Spanbergered continued.\u00a0\"And we need to not ever use the words 'socialist' or 'socialism' ever again. Because while people think it doesn't matter, it does matter. And we lost good members because of it.\" The Associated Press has called 411 of the 435 House seats up for grabs as of Sunday, with\u00a0Democrats set to keep their House majority\u00a0despite losing four seats.

The Trump campaign has spent $3.4 million on TV ads in the state since May 26, according to the Wall Street Journal. By comparison, Biden\u2019s campaign has only spent $1.3 million. Ohio is a key\u00a0battleground state in the 2020 election race, with 18 electoral votes up for grabs. Trump won the state by an eight-point margin in 2016. OHIO VOTERS WILL ACCEPT ELECTION RESULTS AS LEGITIMATE, TOP OFFICIAL SAYS The Trump campaign maintained its ad spending lead in Ohio despite not running any commercials in the state from Sept. 1 to Sept. 21, the Journal reported, citing data from ad firm Kantar Research. The Biden campaign spent over $600,000 on ads during the same period. Trump, however, is booked to spend three times as much on television ads in Ohio between this week and Election Day on Nov. 3, according to the report. A Fox News poll released last week showed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden with a five-point lead overt Trump in Ohio. Earlier this month, Trump suggested that he was willing to spend his own money to secure reelection. Several outlets, including the New York Times, had reported the Trump campaign was facing a potential \u201ccash crunch\u201d ahead of the election.

Lots of $'s & ENERGY!\" Aside from ad spending, the Trump campaign has maintained a strong presence on the ground. Trump personally visited Ohio earlier this month, holding campaign rallies in Vandalia and Swanton. Vice President Mike Pence also hosted a campaign event in Zanesville. Biden has not made a public appearance in Ohio since March. The former\u00a0vice president, however, is expected to visit the state as part of a train tour across eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania following the debate.",

Virginia\u2019s Senate race is between a well-known Democratic incumbent and an underdog Republican political newcomer, but the challenger is confident he can close in down the stretch. \u201cI\u2019m down 9, so I intend to gain 10,\u201d Daniel Gade, a retired Army officer turned university professor\u00a0told Fox News Tuesday, referring to the percentage points his campaign\u2019s internal polling shows him behind Sen. Mark Warner. That polling also shows Gade trailing Warner by a smaller margin than President Trump is lagging behind Democratic 2020 presidential nominee Joe Biden \u2013 a sign the campaign sees as favorable in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016.

GOP SENATE CANDIDATE, A WOUNDED VET, BLASTS DEM CLAIM HE'D END PREEXISTING CONDITIONS COVERAGE To do that, he would need to overcome Warner, a former governor seeking his third term in the U.S. Senate, where he is the top Democrat on the Select Committee on Intelligence. He won by wide margins in his gubernatorial race and his first Senate election, but\u00a0beat GOP challenger Ed Gillespie by less than 1 percent\u00a0in 2014. FILE - This Wednesday July 25, 2018 file photo shows Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) That midterm election year saw a strong showing for Republicans around the country as the party took back control of the Senate. Gade said his numbers show he is out-performing Gillespie at this stage in the race and he pointed to polls from Roanoke College and Virginia Commonwealth University that show climbing support after being down by more than 20 percent at the start of September. A spokesperson for Warner\u2019s re-election campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment, but the senator recently told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that while he\u2019s confident in his record, he doesn\u2019t \u201ctake anything for granted\u201d and is campaigning hard to once again earn voters\u2019 support. Still, no Republican candidate has won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009, according to the paper. And fellow Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in the 2016 presidential election, easily held on to his Senate seat by a 16-point margin in 2018 against GOP challenger Corey Stewart. Gade, who studied environmental science at West Point, has billed himself as a different kind of candidate. He says he\u2019s a career public servant, as opposed to a politician. He received two Purple Hearts during Operation Iraqi Freedom and lost his leg to a roadside bomb, resulting in dozens of surgeries. He remained in the Army until he retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2017. Gade also earned a Ph.D. in public administration and policy and\u00a0served on advisory committees under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, offering insight on issues affecting disabled Americans, prosthetics and veterans, among others. Daniel Gade and former President George W. Bush (Gade For Virginia) One of his key campaign issues is his proposed Stop Insider Trading Act, which would require members of Congress, upon taking office, to put their holdings in a blind trust so that they can\u2019t profit off of information that is unavailable to the public \u2013 which he said is \u201cappalling.\u201d After a blockbuster New York Times report on President Trump\u2019s taxes, he said the legislation should also apply to the executive branch, including the president, vice president and cabinet-level officials. \u201cNone of those folks should be profiting on nonpublic information,\u201d he said. Warner and Gade met last week in their first debate, where one major topic was the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare. (Gade For Virginia) Gade, whose injuries in Iraq left him with a preexisting condition, argued that market-friendly changes to the health care system can still include rules that ensure coverage for people with preexisting conditions. Warner countered that protecting the Obama-era health care law is the best way to guarantee health care for millions of U.S. citizens. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThe ACA\u2019s not perfect, but 20 million Americans got health care coverage,\u201d Warner said. \u201cIt protects three and a half million Virginians, including my daughter, with preexisting conditions.\u201d They have two more scheduled before Election Day.

Election night ended without a presidential race call, as the results in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada\u00a0and Alaska hung in limbo. TRUMP CLAIMS VICTORY WITH MANY STATES STILL UNDECLARED, HINTS AT POSSIBLE SUPREME COURT CASE A Biden campaign official on Wednesday morning, though, told Fox News that the race is moving to a conclusion in their favor. \"This is moving to a conclusion \u2014\u00a0and moving to a conclusion in our favor,\" the official said. The official projected confidence in the contest in Wisconsin, saying they expect it to be called in favor of the former vice president later this Wednesday morning. As for Michigan, the campaign says they will have an \u201cinsurmountable\u201d vote-by-mail lead and expect that battleground state to be called later Wednesday.

The president, speaking from the East Room of the White House, alongside first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence, thanked his supporters and touted \u201crecord\u201d turnout. \u201cI want to thank the American people for their tremendous support. Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we will not stand for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe won't stand for it.\u201d After his remarks, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Biden's campaign manager, said\u00a0in a statement that Trump\u00a0\"does not decide the outcome of this election.\u00a0Joe Biden does not decide the outcome of this election. The American people decide the outcome of this election. And the democratic process must and will continue until its conclusion.\u201d The president was able to declare victory late Tuesday in battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and Iowa, and was able to clinch a big electoral win in traditionally red Texas, among other states, Fox News projected. CLICK HERE FOR LIVE RESULTS \u201cWe won states we weren\u2019t expecting to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFlorida, we didn\u2019t win it, we won it by a lot.\u201d \u201cWe won the great state of Ohio, we won Texas\u2026It is also clear that we have won Georgia,\u201d Trump said, despite that race not yet being called. \u201cThey\u2019re never gonna catch us.

The president, and his campaign throughout the night, complained about the race in Arizona, which Fox News called for his rival, Democrat Joe Biden. The campaign, and the governor of Arizona, argued that some Election Day votes still needed to be counted. \u201cArizona, we have a lot of life in that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSomebody declared victory, and maybe it will be, but certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get. We\u2019re now just getting into Trump territory and that could be overturned.\u201d The president shifted to Pennsylvania, and said he was \u201cwinning\u201d in the state \u201cby a tremendous amount of votes,\u201d despite votes still being counted there. \u201cAll of a sudden, I said, what happened to the election? It\u2019s off,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what happened. They knew they couldn\u2019t win, so they said, let\u2019s go to court.\u201d Trump added that he predicted a legal battle, and said he has \u201cbeen saying this since the day I heard there would be tens of millions of ballots sent,\u201d referring to the unprecedented scale of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment on our country,\u201d Trump said, referring to the votes not being called in key states. \u201cWe were getting ready to win the election, frankly, we did win this election,\u201d Trump said, adding that he wanted to \u201censure the integrity\u201d of the vote, and ensure the law is \u201cused in a proper manner.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want all voting to stop. We don\u2019t want them to find any ballots at 4:00 in the morning and add them to the list.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad moment. To me, this is a very sad moment, and we will win this.\u201d \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we already have won it,\u201d Trump said. Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

            "article_content": "While Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden is leading in the polls, gamblers are backing President Trump as the betting markets show a much closer race. With 50 days to go until Election Day on Nov. 3, it still appears to be Joe Biden\u2019s race to lose. But the contest between the Democratic presidential nominee and President Trump has tightened over the past month. And team Trump continues to suggest that, as in 2016, the Republican is doing better than polls let on. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT THE BIDEN-TRUMP RACE The former vice president leads Trump by 7.4 percentage points, according to an average of the latest national polling compiled by Real Clear Politics. That\u2019s down from 7.7 points a month ago and 8.8 points two months ago. The new average includes a new Fox News national poll released Sunday that showed Biden topping the president 51%-46% among likely voters. The Real Clear Politics average of national polling on this date four years ago showed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by 2.3 points. Clinton led Trump by 3.2 points on the eve of the general election \u2013 and ended up winning the national popular vote by 2%. But the race for the White House isn\u2019t a fight for the national popular vote.\u00a0Trump narrowly topped Clinton in many of the key battleground states, which helped him trounce her in the all-important Electoral College count to win the White House. Biden has a slight 1.2-point edge in Florida, the biggest of the battlegrounds, according to an average of the latest public opinion surveys in the state compiled by Real Clear Politics. That\u2019s down from a 4-point advantage the former vice president held over the GOP incumbent\u00a0a month ago. TOP POLITICAL HANDICAPPER MOVES TWO BATTLEGROUNDS IN TRUMP'S DIRECTION Biden\u2019s up by 4.3 points in Pennsylvania, down from a 5.7-point lead a month ago. He\u2019s ahead by 4.2 points in Michigan, down from 6.3 points one month ago. And in Wisconsin, the former vice president\u2019s leading by 6.3 points, virtually unchanged from a 6.5-point lead a month ago. Clinton led\u00a0Trump in the final poll averages in Michigan, Pennsylvania\u00a0and Wisconsin, and was virtually tied in Florida \u2013 but Trump narrowly edged out Clinton in all four states four years ago. Biden tops the president by 5.6 points in Arizona, up from 2 points a month ago. And the race is basically tied in North Carolina, unchanged from this date in August. Biden holds single-digit leads over the president in Minnesota, Nevada\u00a0and New Hampshire, three states Clinton narrowly captured in 2016. Biden holds the edge in Ohio and the president\u2019s got the slight advantage in Iowa, two competitive states Trump won four years ago. And the president holds a single-digit advantage over his Democratic challenger in Georgia and Texas, once reliably red states that are competitive this cycle. Veteran GOP pollster Daron Shaw \u2013 who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson \u2013 highlighted that \u201ccampaigns are often about partisan homecoming. Trump may be benefiting from this dynamic.\u201d \u201cIt looks like Republican-leaning undecided voters have come around, both in the ballot and his job ratings,\u201d noted Shaw, a polling veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns. Fundraising is another key metric where Biden's made up ground and appears to have the advantage. While both candidates\u00a0had impressive campaign cash hauls last month, Biden and the Democratic National Committee brought in a record-shattering $364.5 million in August, dramatically outraising the president and the Republican National Committee\u2019s $210 million haul. Biden\u2019s surge in fundraising this spring and summer erased Trump\u2019s once vast cash-on-hand advantage over his Democratic challenger. While Election Day's 50 days away, the voting is already underway, with a handful of states sending absentee ballots to registered voters who've requested them. Before the end of September,\u00a0voters in nearly half the states \u2013 including the key battlegrounds of Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and\u00a0Wisconsin \u2013 will receive absentee ballots. Separately,\u00a0early voting\u00a0or in-person absentee balloting gets underway in eight\u00a0states, including the battlegrounds of Michigan and Minnesota, before the end of September.",

President Trump reiterated his call for the 2020 presidential race to be decided on Election Day during a campaign stop in Rome, Georgia on Sunday night. Trump criticized Supreme Court rulings last week allowing Pennsylvania and North Carolina an extended timeframe to receive and count absentee ballots for the 2020 election. The president has argued the election should end on Nov. 3 and all ballots received after that date should not count. \u201cIf you know what would have been really nice? If our Supreme Court could have ruled that everything has to be counted by the evening of our Election Day, instead of waiting around six days, eight days, nine days, giving them more time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they want more time, let them put their ballots in early. They don\u2019t have to wait until the end.\u201d TRUMP WARNS VOTERS IN IOWA THAT BIDEN WILL 'DESTROY YOUR FARMS' Many states count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, so long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3 or earlier. North Carolina will accept ballots received up to nine days after the election after the Supreme Court declined to block a deadline extension. The Supreme Court also temporarily allowed a three-day extension in Pennsylvania that had been ordered by the state\u2019s Supreme Court.

            "article_content": "RNC Senior Communications Advisor of Black Media Affairs Paris Dennard reacts. October already delivered one surprise: President Trump and first lady Melania Trump testing positive for COVID-19. Wednesday night could deliver another: the one and only scheduled\u00a0vice presidential\u00a0debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris could be a show-stopper. Why? Because voters may finally get to see the real Kamala Harris, who has ducked taking a stand on critical issues and has, like Joe Biden, routinely refused to answer questions on the campaign trail. The performance of the California senator could well impact the trajectory of the race. JOHN FUND: 2020 ELECTION'S OCTOBER SURPRISES\u00a0\u2014 WHO'S UP, WHO'S DOWN The VP debate, normally a\u00a0snoozefest, looms large because Biden turns 78 next month and has on occasion appeared incoherent and confused. Many doubt his ability to serve a full four years, much less eight. That puts the heat on Harris, who could become president if Biden wins and is forced to retire. The VP face-off will also likely be a dress rehearsal for 2024.\u00a0Win or lose on Nov. 3, Harris will almost certainly be a Democrat presidential candidate four years from now; Mike Pence could well top the Republican ticket. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Given the stakes, moderator Susan Page of USA Today must absolutely demand that Harris be straight with American voters. We know Pence; we do not know Harris. For instance, both Harris and Biden have refused to say whether they favor packing the Supreme Court and abolishing the Electoral College. This is unacceptable. These controversial ambitions of the Left would fundamentally change how our democracy works and what our nation\u2019s future will be; voters deserve to know where the candidates stand. The VP debate is rarely a hot ticket. In 2016, while the first debate between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attracted a record 84 million viewers, only 37 million people bothered to watch VP candidates Mike Pence, then governor of Indiana, and Democrat Tim Kaine, senator from Virginia. Indeed, the only VP debate that ever caught the nation\u2019s attention was the 2008 encounter between Joe Biden, running with Barack Obama, and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, when 70 million Americans tuned in. Palin drove up the audience. She was new and untested, and at times controversial. But the real reason for the interest in that debate was that the media had alarmed the nation about\u00a072-year-old\u00a0McCain\u2019s health. The New York Times and other liberal outlets published numerous articles darkly hinting that McCain\u2019s several bouts with melanoma could kill him. They were wrong. The Arizona senator died 10 years later of glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. Nonetheless, concern about\u00a0McCain\u2019s ability to survive\u00a0eight years in office\u00a0raised\u00a0the stakes for his VP pick. Today\u2019s situation is similar. In the recent debate against Trump, Biden confounded viewers with sentences like: \u201cThe 20-the 200 mil \u2013 the 200,000 people who have died on his watch, how many of those have survived?\u201d Like Biden, Harris\u2019 positions on numerous issues, like law and order,\u00a0appear as fluid as milk. Biden\u2019s frequent\u00a0lapses are alarming and\u00a0possibly\u00a0explain why\u00a0the former VP\u00a0hid out in his basement for so many months. That puts the\u00a0spotlight\u00a0on Harris. Like her running mate, the senator is campaigning as a moderate, though, like Biden, she is no such thing. In 2019\u00a0GovTrack\u00a0scored her \u201cthe most liberal\u201d among all senators, and noted that she \u201cjoined bipartisan bills\u202fthe\u202fleast\u00a0often\u202fcompared to\u202fSenate Democrats.\u201d Also, like Biden, Harris\u2019 positions on numerous issues, like law and order,\u00a0appear as fluid as milk. Mike Bloomberg, endorsing Harris in his eponymous magazine, lauds the candidate for having improved California\u2019s criminal justice system \u201cby making the data more transparent.\u201d Data collection\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that\u2019s what Bloomberg highlights as Harris\u2019 accomplishments during her terms as district attorney, and then attorney general. What\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0ignored, because it is\u00a0controversial to today\u2019s Democrats, is that she was considered a tough prosecutor, going hard after gangs\u00a0and other criminals\u00a0and\u00a0winning the endorsement of police unions. In the second round of Democratic primary debates, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard reminded viewers that Harris had \u201cput over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations,\u201d and also blocked \u201cevidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row\u2026\u201d No wonder that Harris, who made a big push to win over Black voters in South Carolina, failed to get traction. Today, of course, Harris has pivoted to the Democrat mainstream, agreeing that the U.S. is \u201csystemically racist.\u201d\u00a0She has called Black Lives Matter \u201cbrilliant\u201d and described the protests that erupted into violence \u201can essential component of evolution in our country\u2026\u201d\u00a0Do Black business owners whose shops were burned to the ground in Minneapolis or Seattle agree? In June, Harris cheered Los Angeles Mayor Eric\u00a0Garcetti\u2019s\u00a0announcement that he would cut police funding by $150 million, expressing sympathy for calls to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d The debate moderator should ask her\u00a0how she would respond to the\u00a081\u00a0percent of Black Americans\u00a0who\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent Gallup survey that\u00a0they'd like the police to spend either more or the same amount of time in their community, not less. On abortion, Harris proudly earns a 100% rating from the\u00a0Planned Parenthood Action Fund and from the abortion-rights group NARAL. While many Americans support women\u2019s right to choose, 79%, according to a YouGov poll, disagree with Democrats\u2019 push to allow abortions up to the moment of birth, as is legal now in New York state. Harris has coyly said that the timing of an abortion should be left up to the woman. Also, she voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would penalize doctors who refuse medical care to a child born alive after an attempted\u00a0abortion.\u202fSome 82% of Americans oppose withholding care from newborn babies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Americans need to know, does Harris approve of late-term abortions\u00a0and allowing viable babies to die? There are plenty of issues \u2013 gun control, \u201cMedicare-for-all\" and the Green New Deal, for instance \u2013\u00a0on which Harris has waffled. If Susan Page pins her down, as she should, the race could shift. That would be a real October surprise. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

            "article_content": "Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham joins 'Fox &amp; Friends' from the campaign trail in Florence, S.C. Jaime Harrison, the Democrat challenging Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, is poised for a tight race Tuesday night. He has enjoyed a slight lead in the runup to the election for a seat that Republicans have held for nearly two decades. Here are 5 things to know about Harrison. 1. He shattered multiple fundraising records during this Senate race Harrison announced a record-breaking fundraising haul of $57 million on October 11 for the third quarter of the election cycle. The previous quarterly record -- $38 million -- was held by former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke in his losing 2018 Senate bid against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Harrison has also now both raised and spent more than $100 million overall, by far the most of any Senate candidate in American history. He raked in $107.6 million in donations, but his campaign spent almost as much, doling out $104.1 million. The previous spending record was set in 2018 by\u00a0Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., with $85 million, though much of that total was self-funded. 2. He\u00a0was elected the first African American chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party in 2013. Harrison held the chairmanship until 2017. He is\u00a0also an associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee and former lobbyist for the now-defunct Podesta Group, whose clients included big coal, tobacco companies and big banks. He has also received tens of thousands in donations from lobbyists. Harrison, who is married with two children, has frequently spoken on the campaign trail of his\u00a0humble beginnings as the son of a single teenage mother. During his first debate against Graham, Harrison said he and his wife were still paying off their student loans. Graham snapped back that, given what he\u2019s seen of Harrison\u2019s income from released tax returns, \u201cYou\u2019re a multimillionaire, and you can\u2019t pay off your student loans?\u201d 3.\u00a0He was formerly an aide to South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn Harrison graduated from\u00a0Yale University and later attended Georgetown Law School. He then worked for Clyburn before moving on to posts at\u00a0the Port of Charleston and the University of South Carolina. Clyburn, the House Majority Whip, praised Harrison in an interview with Politico last month saying: \u201cNot a single soul alive believed when he announced for the Senate that he would be sitting here 30 days out, 48-48,\u201d as polls showed the two candidates in a deadlock for the state's Senate seat. 4. He has promised to work across the aisle with Republicans if elected. Harrison has touted his friendship with former South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore and their ability to work together on issues such as education reform and more as evidence of the bipartisan spirit he'll bring to Congress if he is elected. \"It\u2019s the Matt and Jaime traveling roadshow,\u201d Moore once joked of his camaraderie with Harrison despite opposing political views. 5. The Harrison-Graham showdown is on pace to be one of the most expensive in the state's history. Both Harrison and Graham are on track to spend as much as $200 million combined by the time the winner is called. That figure is nearly quadruple the amount spent by all candidates in the 2016 presidential primaries. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Fox News contributor Karl Rove predicted Tuesday that while\u00a0President Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0will likely impact the outcome of the\u00a02020 presidential election, the race\u00a0will ultimately come down to which values the public shares with\u00a0the candidates. \"If the issue is who is\u00a0tougher on China, this is going\u00a0to be a Trump victory,\" Rove told\u00a0\"Bill Hemmer Reports.\" BRIT HUME PREDICTS 2020 RACE WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER VOTERS THINK TRUMP\u00a0OR CHINA ARE TO BLAME \"But,\" he continued,\u00a0\"I think\u00a0elections tend to be about one\u00a0thing, but sometimes they\u00a0aren't, and this may be a time\u00a0where it really looks like\u00a0it's [about] two things,\u00a0the economy and the coronavirus,\u00a0but it may actually be about\u00a0what do you stand for?\u00a0What is\u00a0your view?\u00a0What motivates you?\u00a0What is it you want to achieve\u00a0and are your values the same as\u00a0me?\" \"Those things are always in an\u00a0election,\" Rove added, \"we\u2019ll be paying\u00a0attention to these two big\u00a0issues, but how people respond,\u00a0how the candidates respond by\u00a0sharing who they are, and what\u00a0their vision and their values\u00a0are is going to matter a lot.\" THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN The Biden campaign has recently expanded its staff in preparation for the general election after weeks of\u00a0struggling behind the Trump team\u00a0on the digital front. The online battleground is\u00a0likely to be a vital part of the race\u00a0since most\u00a0traditional campaign avenues have been closed off due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, Rove said he found it\u00a0unlikely that Biden will have success matching Trump's online presence. \"He [Biden] has one-seventh the Twitter\u00a0followers and less than one-seventh\u00a0the YouTube followers\u00a0that Donald Trump has,\" Rove explained.\u00a0\"Trump has spent years building\u00a0this digital infrastructure.\u00a0Biden can\u00a0spend a lot of resources and\u00a0close that gap but I doubt he's\u00a0going to be able to equal it or pass it.\" BIDEN CAMPAIGN REACHES OUT TO 'DISAFFECTED REPUBLICANS' Aside from the pandemic-induced\u00a0reality\u00a0both campaigns have been forced to embrace, Rove said Biden may run into a roadblock when it comes to the \"substance\" of his messaging. \"I am\u00a0at a loss as to what the\u00a0compelling message is\u00a0from\u00a0Joe Biden other than 'I'm not\u00a0Donald Trump,'\" Rove said.\u00a0\"That may be enough, but I'm not\u00a0certain yet that that is going\u00a0to be sufficient.\"",

Secretary of State\u00a0Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told\u00a0WSB Radio\u00a0in Atlanta that officials were still tallying about 50,000 ballots, most of which are in Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, and Chatham County, where Savannah is located. NO CLEAR WINNER IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE AS VOTE COUNTING CONTINUES, ELECTION HANGS IN BALANCE \u201cWe\u2019re looking at by lunchtime having most of this knocked out,\u201d Raffensperger said. \"By and large, all the big numbers are in.\" As of late Thursday morning,\u00a0Georgia\u00a0was one of five\u00a0states that had not yet reported complete election results. The race is still too early to call in those states;\u00a0neither candidate has met the\u00a0270-electoral vote threshold needed to win the presidency. Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling said officials are still trying to determine how many outstanding provisional ballots need to be counted\u00a0but said he hoped there would be a resolution by the end of the day. TRUMP CLAIMS VICTORY WITH MANY STATES STILL UNDECLARED, HINTS AT POSSIBLE SUPREME COURT CASE \u201cWe are working with the counties to try and get a full understanding of how many provisionals might be available,\u201d Sterling said, adding that the election is \"going to be an extremely close margin, especially in the presidential election.\" Biden's victories in Michigan and Wisconsin -- two states that Trump won in 2016 -- left him at 264 electoral votes, meaning he's one battleground state away from becoming president-elect. Although Trump is ahead in Georgia, his lead has dried up overnight as officials count outstanding absentee and mail-in ballots from Atlanta and Savannah, which tend to skew Democratic.

In the waning days of a\u00a0presidential race\u00a0run amid a disruptive and deadly global pandemic, both campaigns and advocacy groups have sent billions of political text messages\u00a0to woo voters. Not only have\u00a0COVID-19 restrictions and health concerns\u00a0made such messaging more crucial than ever, it's cheaper than other forms of communication and has a better track record of grabbing recipients' attention. BIDEN BANKS ON HOLLYWOOD SUPPORT IN FINAL DAYS OF 2020 ELECTION Vote.org said in July that it would be sending \"election reminders to more than 6 million voters in 2020.\" Across the Rust Belt battleground of Michigan, recipients have been inundated with more than\u00a052 million political texts since September. President Trump's reelection campaign reportedly said it would send more than a billion texts, while progressive organization MoveOn told ABC News on Sunday that it had already sent out 350 million messages. A poll worker wearing patriotic clothing pauses on the last day of early voting, Sunday, Nov. 1, 2020, at Columbia University's Forum in the West Harlem neighborhood of New York. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens) Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign and other groups have sent out hundreds of millions of texts.\u00a0According to MIT Technology Review, it's\u00a0estimated that voters will\u00a0have received\u00a0almost 3 billion\u00a0messages. The effort is orchestrated largely with political texting apps\u00a0that utilize public voter registration records to load telephone phone numbers automatically. Most states require voters to give their phone number and address as part of the registration process. While robocalls and texts are widely illegal without the approval of those at the other end of the line, the\u00a0Federal Communications Commission says that outreach from political volunteers is not. Nevertheless, wireless carriers have worried about customer sentiment -- taking a more active role in monitoring the texts, according to The Wall Street Journal. In 2019, carriers agreed to new standards that require senders to get consent before hitting \"send.\" In September, AT&T reportedly sent a memo\u00a0that executives had seen\u00a0a notable\u00a0increase in customer complaints about unwanted texts. While the onslaught is expected to end\u00a0following the election, campaigns have other worries. Chief among them is the spread of misinformation -- particularly since text messages aren't archived and have been misused before. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP This close to Election Day, the brunt of the concern relates to details about polling locations and voting hours. Just two weeks ago, Oklahoma's State Election Board\u00a0issued a warning\u00a0about a fraudulent text message claiming there had been changes to polling places. The phone number linked to the messages was for a\u00a0male escort service. Julia Musto is a reporter for Fox News and Fox Business Digital.",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. After Trump-backed Tommy Tuberville emerged victorious in the Republican primary over former Attorney General Jeff Sessions,\u00a0the Alabama Senate race is soundly underway between Tuberville and incumbent Democrat Doug Jones. As Republicans seek to keep their majority in the Senate, they have their eyes on defeating a Democratic incumbent in a state that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump in 2016. Here\u2019s what to know about the Alabama Senate race: Who are the candidates? Doug Jones Jones won the Senate seat in 2017 in a special election, filling the seat Sessions left vacant to serve as U.S. Attorney General. Sessions, a Republican, had held the seat since 1997. Jones was the first Democrat to represent Alabama in the Senate in 21 years. Jones defeated Republican Alabama Supreme Court Judge Roy Moore\u00a0in December, one month after three women accused Moore of past sexual misconduct. Two of the women\u00a0were minors at the time of the alleged incident. Moore vehemently denied the claims. Six other women accused Moore of pursuing romantic relationships with them or engaging in inappropriate behavior while they were between the ages of 16 and 22 and Moore had been in his 30s. Prominent Republicans such as John McCain, Mitt Romney and Mitch McConnell called on Moore to drop out of the race. President Trump, however, endorsed Moore and accepted his denial of the accusations. KENTUCKY 2020 SENATE RACE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MCGRATH-MCCONNELL CONTEST The Birmingham News editorial board describes Jones as a \u201cmoderate Democrat.\u201d \u201cIf you look at the positions I\u2019ve got on health care, if you look at the positions I got on jobs, you should look at the support I have from the business community, I think I\u2019m pretty mainstream,\u201d Jones told Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy in 2017. \u201cI want to reach across the aisle.\u201d In March 2019, Jones was one of three Democrats to vote \u201cno\u201d with all Senate Republicans on the Green New Deal. He was one of five Democrats to vote for the Republican budget deal in January 2018, but opposes tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. In an interview with the New York Times, he said he hopes to emulate the record of the state\u2019s senior Republican senator Richard Shelby in representing Alabama. According to FiveThirtyEight, Jones has voted with Trump about 35.4 percent of the time. Tommy Tuberville Tuberville is a longtime college football coach who has never held elected office. In August 2018, Tuberville -- who coached at Auburn -- moved from Florida to Alabama with the intent of running for Senate in 2020. Tuberville has closely aligned himself with the president, who endorsed him over his former attorney general after Sessions angered Trump by recusing himself during the Mueller investigation. Trump endorsements have proved successful in most Republican primaries since 2017. Trump has gone above and beyond for Tuberville in hits against his opponent, in May tweeting: \u201c3 years ago, after Jeff Sessions recused himself, the Fraudulent Mueller Scam began. Alabama, do not trust Jeff Sessions. He let our Country down.\u201d Tuberville sought to exploit the Republican divide, declaring that Sessions \u201cthrew Trump to the wolves.\u201d \u201cWhen faced with supporting POTUS or running scared, Jeff Sessions chose the easy way out and recused himself. I won\u2019t ever run from a fight in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Tuberville said. Tuberville opposes abortion, wants to repeal ObamaCare and, like Sessions, has a hard-line stance on immigration, supporting the president\u2019s plans to build a border wall. His opponent Jones has said a border wall would be too costly. Race overview Tuberville ran an under-the-radar primary race, rarely holding public events or agreeing to interviews. Tuberville plans to keep a Trump-centric focus for his race, campaign officials tell the New York Times. His campaign will continue to remind voters of Jones\u2019 vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his vote against the president in the impeachment trial. That said, Jones has noted that\u00a0he believes Alabama voters will appreciate his independence from the president. \u201cI have the luxury of telling people in Alabama, \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to be for President Trump on issues that are good for Alabama, and I\u2019ve done that,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019m going to speak out when he\u2019s doing things that are not good for Alabama.\u201d Jones has pushed for Tuberville to agree to debate him, saying voters deserve a debate, but Tuberville has yet to commit to accepting the invitation. HOW JEFF SESSIONS WENT FROM TOP TRUMP ALLY TO WHITE HOUSE OUTCAST \u201cWe\u2019ll sort through the invitations and then we\u2019ll decide,\u201d Tuberville said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, before suggesting that party labels and loyalty tell voters all they need to know. \u201cThe difference is, he takes his marching orders from the Democratic side ... and I stand with President Trump. So, you know, if you think about it, that pretty much tells most of the people in Alabama, all the voters, what they need to know,\u201d Tuberville said. Jones said in a separate interview that voters deserve a debate. \u201cLook, he didn\u2019t debate Jeff Sessions and so I\u2019m confident he\u2019s going to be too afraid to debate me, because I do have a record that he can\u2019t just slap a label on when he\u2019s on the debate stage,\u201d Jones said. Who has the edge? Jones is considered by some observers to be the most vulnerable incumbent senator this cycle. Cook Political Report has rated the Alabama Senate race as \u201clean R\u201d and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball has rated Alabama as \u201clikely R.\u201d Jones has the edge of being the incumbent, but he won his race under unique circumstances-- just weeks before many in his opponent\u2019s party had called him to drop out.

            "article_content": "Biden claims corruption allegations a 'Russian' disinformation campaign spread by Giuliani In the second and final presidential debate Thursday night, Americans witnessed a much less raucous, more coherent, and more substantive \u2014 in other words, a more normal \u2014 discussion than the first debate just three weeks ago. That being said, it is safe to say the 96-minute exchange between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will likely not fundamentally alter the presidential race. Over 48 million Americans have already voted, and few people remain undecided. However, in my view, President Trump\u2019s performance was measured, on message, and controlled. Thus, for any remaining undecided voters and Republican-oriented voters who may have been discouraged by the president\u2019s chaotic first debate, Trump\u2019s performance Thursday night likely reassured them and may even have led some to resolve to cast ballots in his favor. TRUMP, BIDEN CLASH OVER HUNTER BIDEN BUSINESS QUESTIONS AT FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE Moreover, the president\u2019s performance reinforces an argument I made in a Fox News op-ed earlier this week: that Biden is ahead, but his victory is not a forgone conclusion. And make no mistake, it is within the realm of possibility that Trump will stage a comeback that is reminiscent of his upset victory in 2016. During the debate, Biden held his own for the most part, and his performance is not likely to dissuade any voters or impact his polling position. However, as the night went on, Biden\u2019s performance slowly diminished. He struggled to come up with coherent answers to pressing questions from Trump about controversial topics \u2014 such as receiving funds from Russian sources \u2014 other than to issue blanket denials and turning the accusation back onto Trump. Further, Biden committed a number of gaffes throughout the night, including making a misplaced Hitler reference that confounded pundits across the aisle. \u201cHaving a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing,\u201d Trump said of his relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Biden shot back, \u201cThat's like saying we had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe.\u201d Additionally, in a sign that the former vice president was growing increasingly uncomfortable, Biden checked his watch in the final 15 minutes of the debate in a way that for most older Americans was reminiscent of President George H.W. Bush during his 1992 town hall debate with challenger Bill Clinton, who went on to defeat Bush. The moment painted a picture of Bush as an out-of-touch career politician who was not attuned to the struggles of working families. Though this will likely not be the case for Biden \u2014 given that Biden is for the most part viewed as a champion for the middle-class and working-class \u2014 the move was symbolic of Biden\u2019s weakened performance as the night went on. To that end, with some success, Trump worked to reclaim his 2016 role of an \u201coutsider\u201d running against a rival career politician. Trump landed several attacks on Biden for being a career politician who has been in Washington for five decades, yet has not achieved meaningful reforms on issues such as immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s all talk but no action with these politicians,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhy didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done.\u201d While it is harder for Trump to position himself as an \u201coutsider\u201d as the sitting president, his attacks on Biden also made it more difficult for Biden to present himself as a change agent who will enact meaningful reforms on immigration, crime and even health care. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In terms of Biden\u2019s strong points, as with the previous debates, Biden\u2019s best moment was during the segment on the coronavirus pandemic. Facing a calmer and less volatile Trump, Biden was able to make the central case for his candidacy: that this election should be a referendum on Trump\u2019s failed pandemic leadership. \u201cIf you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this: anyone who is responsible, for not taking control \u2014 in fact, saying \u2018I take no responsibility at all\u2019 initially \u2014 anyone that is responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America,\u201d Biden said. The pandemic has taken the lives of more than 222,000 Americans, and more than 8.3 million people in the U.S. have been infected with the coronavirus. In another plus for Biden \u2014 and to the likely disappointment of the Trump campaign \u2014 the former vice president successfully avoided a lengthy discussion about the foreign business contacts of his son Hunter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden\u2019s flat-out denial of any wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior prevented Trump from compellingly linking Joe Biden to Hunter\u2019s activities in a way that could help Trump politically. Ultimately, in my view, Trump\u2019s performance was by all measures stronger than Biden\u2019s, and demonstrated to voters that the president is still in the race.

            "article_content": "Chief White House correspondent John Roberts reacts to Trump White House statement on 'Democracy 2020.' President Trump on Thursday said he and his campaign will \u201cnot\u00a0allow corruption to steal\u201d the election during a press conference at the White House, while maintaining\u00a0that he will win the 2020 presidential race despite a dwindling path toward reelection as votes continue to come in. The president, speaking\u00a0from the James S. Brady press briefing room at the White House on Thursday evening, said that his \u201cgoal is to defend the integrity of the election.\u201d BIDEN SAYS HE HAS 'NO DOUBT' HE WILL DEFEAT TRUMP AFTER VOTE COUNT IS FINISHED \u201cIf you count the legal votes, I easily win,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will not allow corruption to steal such an important election\u2014or any election for that matter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow anyone to silence our voters or manufacture results.\u201d The president said many polling places wouldn\u2019t let \u201clegally permitted observers\u201d watch the ballot\u00a0counting. \u201cThis is a case where they\u2019re trying to steal an election \u2014 trying to rig an election,\u201d he said. Trump has claimed fraud and\u00a0malfeasance on the part of Democrats in the days after Election Day. \u201cWe were winning in all of the key locations by a lot, and miraculously, our numbers started getting whittled away in secret,\u201d Trump said, The president has also continuously lambasted the mail-in voting, saying that it was ripe for fraud and, on Thursday, that it\u00a0would \u201cdestroy our system.\u201d Due to the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans voted by mail to avoid gathering in crowds at polling places. Despite the president's claims, election officials and polling experts said there is very little proof that mail-in voting is any more susceptible to fraud than voting in person. The president also referenced Pennsylvania, where he said he was ahead by \u201c700,000 votes, and that gets whittled down to 90,000 \u2014 and the ballots \u2014 they\u2019ll keep coming and coming. They find them all over.\u201d The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in several states throughout the nation this week, seeking access for poll watching. In Pennsylvania, an appellate court judge cleared\u00a0the way for the Trump campaign to more closely observe the canvassing of ballots by the Philadelphia County Board of Elections. Poll watchers were initially required to remain at least 25 feet away from tables where\u00a0people were carrying on the task of scanning mail and absentee ballots inside the Pennsylvania Convention Center, but Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court Judge Christine Fizzano Cannon issued an order requiring \u201call candidates, watchers, or candidate representatives be permitted to be present for the canvassing process\u201d and \u201cbe permitted to observe all aspects of the canvassing process within 6 feet, while adhering to all COVID-19 protocols, including\u00a0wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.\u201d PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS 'SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND' BALLOTS REMAIN TO BE COUNTED The order was to go into effect immediately, or no later than 10:30 a.m. ET on Nov. 5. The city of Philadelphia and\u00a0the Pennsylvania Democratic Party\u00a0appealed the ruling to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, whose justice will decide whether to grant or deny the appeal. \u201cThey\u2019re appealing \u2014\u00a0I wonder why they\u2019re appealing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll we want is to have people watch while they do the tabulation.\u201d The president added that places like \"Detroit and Philadelphia cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a very important presidential race.\u201d \u201cThere is absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if its straight, they should be proud of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying, obviously, to commit fraud and there is no question about that.\u201d Trump went on to call Philadelphia a \u201ccorrupt Democrat machine.\u201d Meanwhile, the president urged his Democratic rival Joe Biden to \u201cclarify\u201d what type of votes should be counted. \u201cI challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes \u2014 they say the word votes \u2014 we want legal votes to be counted,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOpenness and transparency, no illegal votes cast after Election Day.\u201d Biden, earlier in the day, said that he believed that \"each ballot must be counted,\u201d and urged supporters to stay \u201ccalm.\u201d \u201cEach ballot must be counted and thats what we\u2019re going to see going through now and that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d Biden said Thursday afternoon. \u201cDemocracy is sometimes messy and sometimes includes patience as well.\u201d Trump maintained that he and his campaign \u201cwant an honest election, we want an honest count and we want honest people working back there.\u201d TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS VICTORY AS EARLY AS FRIDAY During his press briefing, Trump claimed he would win the presidential race, while Biden on Thursday said that he has \"no doubt\" he will win the election during\u00a0short remarks he made from Wilmington, Del., \"We continue to feel very good about where things stand,\" Biden said. \"And we have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator Harris and I will be the winners.\" The Biden campaign criticized Trump's press briefing, with one Biden staffer calling it \"desperate, baseless and a sure sign he\u2019s losing.\" Two days after Election Day, neither candidate had amassed the votes needed to win the White House. Fox News projected victories for Biden in the Great Lakes states, which left him at 264 meaning he was one battleground state away from becoming president-elect. Trump, with a projected 214 electoral votes, faced a much higher hurdle. To reach 270, he needed to claim all four remaining battlegrounds: Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada.\u00a0Trump generally was projected to receive a larger in-person voter turnout on Election Day, and Biden was thought to have a larger turnaround through vote by mail.

Sign up\u00a0here.**STEADY AS SHE GOESFirst off: Great job,\u00a0fellow weirdos.Aside from a few handfuls of angry protesters,\u00a0right\u00a0and\u00a0left, Americans seem to be handling Election Week with aplomb. We knew it would probably take some time before we could sort out all the results, and citizens \u2013 and markets \u2013 are so far showing admirable patience.Despite the fears and forecasts of chaos and destruction, Americans seem to be hanging loose.Since the dawn of no-excuse absentee voting in the late 1970s, the trend has moved toward more and more early voting and, by extension, longer waits for election results. We all remember how it took days and days to get the full picture of the 2018 midterms. But because of coronavirus, what had been\u00a0adagio\u00a0has turned into\u00a0largo\u00a0this year.The price Americans pay for the ease and comfort of avoiding Election Day waits is waiting longer for the elections to actually be resolved.But the wait seems to be coming to an end.There are now four toss-up states on the presidential level \u2013 Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada \u2013 worth a combined 57 electoral votes that have yet to be called. Challenger\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is sitting on a stack of 264 votes, just six away from victory, compared to incumbent\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s 214. Trump can\u2019t afford to lose a single state if he hopes to retain power. While he stands a good chance to hold on in North Carolina, Trump\u2019s next-best hope, Georgia, is shaping up as a real struggle. He faces steepening odds in Pennsylvania and has the slimmest of hopes in Nevada.Like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs, he\u2019s going to have plenty of trouble protecting his tail today.Trump and his campaign are trying to convey the idea that he is on offense by filing lawsuits from coast to coast to try to stop some of the remaining votes from being counted. But unless we soon see signs of a Trump rally in the ballots still out, it will be hard for Trumpland to maintain a sense of possibility.Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0and other Republican heavyweights are already starting to turn the page on the presidency a bit, shifting focus to how a Senate still likely in GOP hands\u00a0will confront\u00a0a Biden presidency and to start\u00a0fencing in loose talk\u00a0about a Trump victory.There are still about 1.3 million votes yet to be counted across Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, but the counting should go quickly today. By the time we get to the end of Election Day IV, the world may look very different.But whenever we get there, we can be proud that so far we\u2019ve mostly kept our heads about us.\u00a0THE RULEBOOK: MIX IT ALL TOGETHER\u201cThe ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are, first, unity; secondly, duration; thirdly, an adequate provision for its support; fourthly, competent powers. The ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense are, first, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due responsibility.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton, writing about the executive department,\u00a0Federalist No. 70TIME OUT: END OF THE TRAILSmithsonian: \u201cDespite pandemic-caused shutdowns and travel restrictions across Alaska, a small valley in the Southeast still expects its habitual visitors: bald eagles. In early November, thousands of the birds of prey gather in Haines, Alaska, forming one of the largest congregations of the species in the world. Alaskans often depict their location in the state by using their right hand as a map. With just a pointer finger and thumb extended, thumb pointing down, the Chilkat Valley\u2014also known as the Valley of the Eagles\u2014is where thumb meets hand on Alaska\u2019s panhandle. The Chilkat Valley, a peninsula saddled between glaciated mountain chains and the Chilkat and Chilkoot river systems, is nearly 75 miles north of Juneau. The valley extends from the Canadian border south, past the indigenous village of Klukwan, to the small town of Haines, originally called\u00a0Deish\u00fa\u00a0by Alaska Natives, or \u2018end of the trail.\u2019\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.HOW IT\u2019S PLAYINGThousands of Georgia absentee ballots still need to be counted -\u00a0AJC: \u201cAbout 78,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted in Georgia Wednesday night as Joe Biden pulled within about 32,000 votes of President Donald Trump. Most of these uncounted absentee ballots are concentrated in highly populated areas, led by Fulton County in Atlanta and Chatham County in Savannah. \u2026 These figures are publicly available from the secretary of state\u2019s website. There are likely additional absentee ballots left to be tallied that were returned to county election offices before Tuesday\u2019s 7 p.m. deadline but hadn\u2019t yet been processed. The large number of remaining absentee ballots could delay final election results into Thursday or later. \u2026 Secretary of State\u00a0Brad Raffensperger\u00a0said he wants counties to finish counting absentee ballots quickly so that close races can be decided. State law gives county election officials until Nov. 13 to certify final election results.\u201dTar Heel State won\u2019t finish vote counting for days -\u00a0The [Raleigh] News and Observer: \u201cThe nation\u2019s attention turned to North Carolina Wednesday as its choice for president remained undecided, its major races split along party lines and its final outcome uncertain until next week. With record voter turnout, President Donald Trump held a narrow lead in the state over Democratic candidate Joe Biden in a nail-biter contest watched nationwide. North Carolina is one of several battleground states where provisional and absentee ballots are still being counted, preventing either Biden or Trump from claiming the 270 electoral votes needed to win. The process, spelled out in state law, means it\u2019s likely that the winner of North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes for president won\u2019t be known until Nov. 12 or 13. \u2026 A few hundred people gathered Wednesday afternoon at CCB Plaza in downtown Durham, marching to the Board of Elections office, where they raised their fists and cheered in appreciation for those working to count ballots.\u201dBiden catching up to Trump in Pennsylvania -\u00a0Politico: \u201cWith President Donald Trump leading Joe Biden by 196,000 votes and 12 percent of the estimated vote still uncounted, Pennsylvania Democrats and Republicans spent Wednesday working out the rough math surrounding the as-yet-uncounted mail-in ballots. There were more than 1 million mail ballots left to be counted as of 2:35 p.m., according to Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of State. So far, 78 percent of mail ballots have broken for Biden and 21 percent have been won by Trump. If that pace continues \u2014 and it\u2019s a big if \u2014 Biden would take the lead. Looking at the amount of mail ballots Biden is winning as well as the places still to be fully counted, some Democratic elected officials and consultants, including Sen.\u00a0Bob Casey, estimate Biden will carry Pennsylvania by about 100,000 votes in a tight race.\u201dStill waiting on Nevada -\u00a0Nevada Independent: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s slim lead over President Donald Trump in Nevada remained unchanged on Wednesday after several hours of will-they-or-won\u2019t-they from state and local elections officials in Nevada who had earlier in the day said they would release new numbers in the tight and increasingly important contest. \u2026 The secretary of state\u2019s office is now expected to post new results about 9 a.m. Thursday, while Washoe County said to expect its results before 10 a.m. and Clark County has a press briefing scheduled for the same time. The back-and-forth among state and local election officials on Wednesday came as the nation trained its eyes on Nevada as Biden slowly inched his way toward securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential race.\u201dAlaska absentee, early votes won\u2019t be counted until next week -\u00a0Alaska Public Media: \u201cUsually on Alaska\u2019s Election Night, the big story is the votes that are counted. But in a year unlike any other, Tuesday\u2019s takeaway was about the votes that still remained to be counted. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 120,000 Alaskans cast absentee and early votes that won\u2019t be counted until next week. Another 40,000 absentee ballots were mailed to Alaskans and haven\u2019t been returned, and will be counted as long as they\u2019re postmarked by Election Day and received by the state by legal deadlines later this month. And even as of midnight Wednesday, state officials had only counted a total of about 130,000 votes that came from about half of Election Day polling places, with the other half of polling places still not reporting results \u2014 meaning that altogether, more than half of all ballots still remain to be counted.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYMcConnell shifts on timing and calls for coronavirus package before end of the year\u00a0-\u00a0PoliticoThe 2022 Senate battle has already begun\u00a0-\u00a0Roll CallAUDIBLE: WOOF!\u201cWilbur will follow in the pawprints of\u00a0Brynneth Pawltro, a rescue pitbull mix, who served as mayor last term, the outlet reported.\u201d \u2013\u00a0A small town in Kentucky elected their new \u201cmayor,\u201d a French bulldog named\u00a0Wilbur Beast, in a landslide victory Tuesday.Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.STAY WEIRD, AMERICAKEZJ: \u201cThis is weird, even by 2020 standards. A group of people, including a man from Idaho Falls, was recently busted in Yellowstone National Park while they were cooking a chicken in one of the park\u2019s geothermal hot springs. The culinary event happened in early August, according to\u00a0Nate Eaton\u00a0at East Idaho News, when park authorities were given reports of a group carrying cooking gear towards a hot spring. Rangers arrived and found the group had two chickens cooking in the hot waters of a spring. The Idaho Falls man was given a citation for walking in the thermal area, to which he plead guilty.

            "article_content": " Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u00a0steadily gained ground on President Trump in both Pennsylvania and Georgia as more mail votes were counted Thursday and overnight into Friday, inching the former vice president closer to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. In Georgia and Pennsylvania specifically, Biden now leads. Though with a razor-thin margin there, the Georgia secretary of state Friday said he expects a recount. Biden sits at 264 electoral votes in states where races have been called while Trump has 214 in called races. Biden needs just one win in any of the swing states with races that have not yet been called by the Fox News Decision Desk -- Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia -- while Trump would need to win all four of those states plus Alaska, which he is expected win but is too early to call because of a lack of votes reported. BIDEN OVERTAKES TRUMP IN GEORGIA COUNT AS TALLY NEARS COMPLETION \"We continue to feel very good about where things stand. We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Sen.\u00a0Harris and I will be declared the winners,\" Joe Biden said in brief remarks on Thursday. \"So I ask everyone to stay calm, all the people to stay calm. The process is working. The count is being completed, and we'll know very soon.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday also predicted a victory for Biden despite the fact that the race has not yet been called: \"This morning it is clear that the Biden-Harris ticket will win the White House.\" Trump, meanwhile, accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the election in remarks he made from the White House. \"Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election, we will not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election for that matter,\" Trump said, though the only specific accusation of voter fraud his campaign\u00a0has presented -- one woman in Nevada -- was disputed by the voter registrar in the county where the campaign made the allegation. His campaign also claimed broadly it is possible that thousands of people who no longer live\u00a0in Nevada, citing \"publicly-available data,\" voted improperly there. But\u00a0the legal merits of its claims are disputed by liberal groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which says laws around legal residency generally favor people who temporarily leave the state. A Fox News examination of votes the Trump campaign is claiming were cast illegally in Clark County, Nev., appears to reveal that many --though not necessarily all -- are military members on assignment to various bases around the country. Such military members are allowed to keep their residences and vote in their home states if they plan to return after their assignment. The Trump campaign also\u00a0complained that it is not being given good enough access to observe votes being tallied in Michigan and Pennsylvania. It says it will demand a recount in Wisconsin, though it appears unlikely a recount could close the margin of about 20,000 votes between Trump and Biden there. Lawsuits by the Trump campaign were dismissed in Michigan and Georgia. But the Trump campaign got a favorable ruling on one issue from a judge in Pennsylvania. It\u00a0required Philadelphia election officials\u00a0to let GOP observers within 6 feet of workers\u00a0counting ballots. But the campaign maintained the city was not following the ruling. And it lost a federal lawsuit asking for vote-counting in Philadelphia to stop. FEDERAL JUDGE DISMISSES TRUMP REQUEST TO STOP COUNTING PHILADELPHIA BALLOTS \"If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,\" Trump said Thursday evening. The Biden campaign has said the Trump legal efforts are \"pathetic.\" \"This is not the behavior of a winning campaign,\"\u00a0Biden spokesman Andrew Bates added.\u00a0\"Plain and simple, Donald Trump has lost Wisconsin, he is losing Michigan, and he is losing the presidency.\" And Philadelphia election officials said that Trump continues to \"spew baseless claims of fraud, things for which his team has not produced one iota of evidence.\" Philadelphia\u00a0City Commissioners Chairwoman Lisa Deeley, when asked about GOP claims that they have not been able to actually observe ballots that Philadelphia workers are counting, said, \"we have a live stream, anybody can watch\" and added that \"there have been observers.\" Here's where things stand in the major swing states that have not yet been called. Pennsylvania Trump's lead in Pennsylvania was hundreds of thousands of votes after Election Day. But Democrats requested and returned mail ballots at a much higher rate than Republicans, which are being counted\u00a0later because they are far\u00a0more labor-intensive to count than in-person votes. Trump's lead continually narrowed over Wednesday and Thursday and as of Friday morning, Biden overtook the president in the key state. Biden lead over 13,000 votes with 98% reporting. Biden overtook Trump as a tranche of votes came in from Philadelphia county, bumping up its reporting numbers from 91% to 95%. Most areas in the state, including conservative rural areas and Democrat-leaning suburbs, were reporting approximately 95% of votes or more as of\u00a0 Friday afternoon. But the\u00a0heavily Democratic Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh, was only reporting 90% BIDEN TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION: REPORT Biden's new lead, with more likely Democrat-leaning mail votes to be counted, puts him firmly in command in the state\u00a0which for months has been considered the most important battleground in the 2020 election. Georgia A similar situation existed in Georgia over Wednesday and Thursday, with Trump leading after Election Day but Biden closing the gap as more mail ballots are counted. And on Friday morning Biden officially overtook Trump in the vote total there, taking a more than\u00a01,500 vote\u00a0lead in the state with 99% of votes reporting. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a press briefing on Friday that there will be a recount in Georgia with the margin so close, and swore that the state would ensure its process is transparent and that any irregularities would be investigated. \"The focus of our office and for the county election officials,\" Raffensperger said, is to ensure that\u00a0\"every legal vote\" is\u00a0\"counted and recorded accurately.' He\u00a0added: \"In Georgia, this process is and will remain open and transparent to monitors.\" Raffensperger's office said that it is aware of 4,169 ballots that are yet to be counted as of Friday afternoon\u00a0and that there are 8,890 outstanding military ballots that if received by the end of Friday may be counted. Nevada Votes have come in slowly in Nevada, with 87% reporting as of Friday afternoon. JOE BIDEN SAYS HE HAS 'NO DOUBT' HE WILL DEFEAT TRUMP WHEN VOTE COUNT IS FINISHED But Biden has maintained a lead in the state, which as of Friday afternoon\u00a0was over 20,000 votes. That equates to 1.6%. Votes that haven't been counted in Nevada come approximately uniformly from Republican-leaning and Democrat-leaning counties. If the Nevada race is projected for Biden it could make the tense vote counts in places like Pennsylvania and Georgia irrelevant, as its six\u00a0electoral votes would give Biden exactly 270. North Carolina Trump appears the strongest among the remaining battleground states in North Carolina. With 94% of the votes in as of Friday afternoon, the president leads by more than 76,000 votes in the state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The static nature of the North Carolina race is unlikely to change until next week, Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state elections board, said\u00a0Thursday. She said with \"very few exceptions would North Carolina's numbers move before the 12th or the 13th.\" This is partially because the state accepts mail ballots that\u00a0were sent by Election Day but arrive up to nine days later. County elections boards also have to handle provisional ballots. Democrats voted by mail in much larger numbers than Republicans this year. But Biden has a large Trump lead to overcome in North Carolina, though he does not need to win the state to win the presidential election.

A new\u00a0national poll\u00a0shows Democratic challenger Joe Biden holding an 11-point lead over President Trump with five months to go until the November\u00a0general election. And the\u00a0Monmouth University survey \u2013 which was conducted last Thursday through Monday, as protests and violent clashes swept major cities across the country in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 indicates that more voters trust the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee than the GOP incumbent in the White House to handle\u00a0race relations\u00a0in the country. TAKING AIM AT TRUMP OVER RACIAL UNREST, BIDEN SAYS THE PRESIDENT'S 'PART OF THE PROBLEM' According to the poll, the former vice president currently tops Trump 52-41 percent among registered voters nationwide in a general election matchup. Biden was ahead of the president by 9 points in Monmouth\u2019s May poll and had a 4-point edge over Trump in their April survey. A Real Clear Politics average of the latest national polling puts Biden 6 points ahead of the president. The former vice president also has the edge over Trump right now in most of the recent polling in the key general election battleground states. Four years ago, at a similar point in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton held a single-digit advantage over then-candidate Trump in most national and crucial swing state polling. Clinton ended up winning the national popular vote by 2 percent, but Trump carried the Electoral College count to win the White House. Fifty-two percent of those questioned in the Monmouth poll said they have a great deal or some confidence in Biden to handle race relations, with 40 percent feeling the same way about the president. Half said they had no confidence in Trump to handle race relations, with 29 perent saying the same thing about Biden. THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS One-third of voters questioned said that race relations will be a major factor in their vote for president this year, with another 17 percent saying it will be a minor factor. Nearly half said it won\u2019t be a factor at all. \u201cThe race continues to be largely a referendum on the incumbent. The initial reaction to ongoing racial unrest in the country suggests that most voters feel Trump is not handling the situation all that well,\u201d Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said. Just under half of those polled said they have confidence in the president\u2019s ability to deal with the nation\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, with just over half saying they\u2019re confident of Biden\u2019s ability to steer the recovery. More voters \u2013\u00a038 percent \u2013 said\u00a0Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak makes it less likely he\u2019ll be reelected, with 18 percent saying more likely and four in 10 saying the president\u2019s performance will have no impact on the November results. And most voters said that current limitations on holding in-person campaign events \u2013 such as rallies \u2013 due to coronavirus health concerns will have no impact on the campaign\u2019s tone. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN \u201cThe lack of a public campaign during the pandemic may be hurting Trump, but it is not necessarily helping Biden. Trump has not been able to lean on the large rallies that generate positive feedback for him, but Biden has not been much of a presence at all on the public stage. Many voters think the Democrat could do a good job, but they haven\u2019t seen enough of him to judge for certain,\u201d Murray said. The Monmouth University Poll was conducted May 28-June 1, with 807 adults nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s sampling error based on 742 registered voters is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.",

With a margin that small, there will be a recount in Georgia,\" he said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP According to the secretary of state\u2019s office, the recount will\u00a0be done on high-speed scanners at each county\u2019s central election office. In Georgia, a recount can only be\u00a0requested after the state has undergone a \"risk-limiting audit\" and state certification of the vote, according to NPR. The\u00a0certification process is set to be finalized by Nov. 20. Julia Musto is a reporter for Fox News and Fox Business Digital.",

            "article_content": " On Tuesday night, the American people spoke. They spoke with millions upon millions of voices to produce the greatest presidential election voter turnout in over a century. And they sent a variety of messages, most of them quite positive. Voters rejected the prevailing narratives of a media determined to make the election a pure referendum on Donald Trump's character. Even if former Vice President Joe Biden prevails eventually, he will likely be faced with a Republican Senate majority and a 2022 contest that will put the House of Representatives squarely in Republican sights. Voters rejected the pollsters' overconfident modeling: Pollsters were dramatically wrong in their national numbers and just as wrong in their Senate estimates. Voters apparently aren't all that interested in registering their opinions with elite firms who see them as social science subjects rather than as individuals. TRUMP WAS 'CORRECT' THAT ELECTION WOULD BE 'MUCH CLOSER' THAN MOST THOUGHT: FRANK LUNTZ Voters stuck to their guns in red states; they stuck to their guns in blue states; they stuck to their guns in purple states. One message resonated above all others: the outright rejection of the ongoing quest by Democrats and the media to paint Americans into racial categories and then declare demographics destiny. America is divided, and it is not growing less divided just out of the elitists' overwrought and hysterical mewling about Trump. This is still a country that is one-third conservative, one-third liberal and one-third in the middle. But one message resonated above all others: the outright rejection of the ongoing quest by Democrats and the media to paint Americans into racial categories and then declare demographics destiny. Donald Trump bucked four long years of Democrats and media members labeling both him and his supporters\u00a0White supremacists, bigots and homophobes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER He refused to be cowed by a media determined to paint him as a racist for refusing the faulty premise that America is institutionally bigoted. And he won an increased share of Black and Hispanic voters. According to Edison exit polling, as of election night, Trump had gained 2 points with White women; 4 points with Black men and 4 points with Black women; 3 points with Latino men and 3 points with Latino women; and 5 points in the \"other\" category. In Florida, according to NBC News exit polling, Trump's coalition included a 55% share of the Cuban American vote, a 30% share of the Puerto Rican vote and 48% of \"other Latinos.\" Trump substantially elevated the national share of Latino and Black voters for Republicans -- and did so without pandering on illegal immigration or buying into the trite and ugly lies of the Black Lives Matter movement. It wasn't just Trump. In California, a majority-minority state, voters refused to greenlight the racist Proposition 16, which would have repealed a state constitutional provision banning racial discrimination, paving the way for reparations and affirmative action. They did so by a margin of over 10 points and despite the fact that Prop 16 advocates spent 12 times the money their opponents did. All of this has sent woke thinkers into spasms of apoplexy. Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of the pseudo-historical \"1619 Project,\" tweeted out that Latinos can no longer be considered a racial category since some Cubans are \"white.\" Charles Blow of The New York Times tweeted, \"We are surrounded by racists.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Actually, Hannah-Jones and Blow aren't surrounded by racists. They're surrounded by people who reject racism and reject the implicitly racist belief that ethnicity ought to dictate voting patterns. All of this is excellent news. Americans spoke Tuesday night. They spoke as Americans, as individuals, not as members of contrived interest groups. And that is certainly worth celebrating. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BEN SHAPIRO",

            "article_content": "Proposition 16 would allow the reinstatement of affirmative action programs in California and repeal the 1996 ban on consideration of race, gender or ethnicity in public university admissions and public contracting. In 1996, 54% of Californians voted to pass Proposition 209, a measure that banned discrimination or preferential treatment by public colleges or other government agencies on the basis of race, gender\u00a0or ethnicity, ending all affirmative action practices in the state. Now, 24 years later, California Democrats have placed Proposition 16 on Tuesday's ballot, a measure to reverse Prop 209 and which would \u201cpermit\u00a0government decision-making policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin to address diversity.\u201d In an interview with Fox News, Peter Kirsanow, a commissioner on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, said that if passed, Prop 16 would result in more discrimination, would further exacerbate the country\u2019s racial divide and would do more harm than good for those the initiative aims to help.AOC CLAIMS YOUNG VOTERS WILL CHOOSE BIDEN BECAUSE THEY CAN INFLUENCE HIM MORE EASILY \u201cProp 16, by allowing discrimination by elites on the basis of race and national origin in color, would actually harm Black, Hispanic, all students, the very individuals that it purports to help,\u201d Kirsanow told Fox News. Before Prop 209 was passed, minority students were not succeeding due to a phenomenon referred to as the \u201cmismatch effect,\u201d he explained. \u201cColleges were engaging in racial discrimination and they were admitting Black and Latino students predominantly, who were not prepared for the institutions that were admitting them. So they had a more difficult time, they struggled and were far more likely to flunk out.\u201d According to Kirsanow, since the passing of Prop 209, students are more likely to be admitted into schools for which they are properly qualified and, as a result, graduation rates among minority students have increased. Nicole Derse, the leading senior strategist for the Yes on Prop 16 initiative, told Fox News the ballot initiative is \u201ca chance to level the playing field for women and people of color.\u201dBERNIE SANDERS EYEING POTENTIAL BIDEN CABINET ROLE: REPORT Derse argued that women and people of color still face significant barriers when it comes to business, state contracts, and education, an imbalance Prop 16 would aim to neutralize. \u201cCalifornians want to take action on systemic racism. They're talking about it at their dinner tables, they're talking about it in their schools, they know that we need to do something and Proposition 16 is a tool in which we can use to address systemic racism and gender discrimination,\u201d said Derse. A former chair of the board of directors of the Center for New Black Leadership, Kirsanow fundamentally disagrees with identity politics and rejects all forms of discrimination. \u201cIn the United States of America, we shouldn't be engaging in any kind of racial discrimination, national origin discrimination. California stood up against that in 1996 by the passage of Prop 209, it should not revert back to the old days of Jim Crow.\u201d California was the first of what is now nine states that have banned consideration of race, gender or ethnicity in public university admissions and public contracting. While Prop 16 has received a number of large endorsements \u2012\u00a0including Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris \u2012\u00a0the latest polling shows support for the initiative remains below 40%.

Throughout the race, Trump has harped on the record-low Black unemployment seen before the coronavirus pandemic, while Biden chose Sen.

Biden held an 81-point lead over Trump among Black voters, according to Pew Research data posted on Oct. 9. However, data analysis released by The New York Times on Wednesday showed that the so-called racial gap among voters has shrunk since 2016 as Trump has picked up support from both Black and Latino voters. New York Times/Siena College polling also found that nonwhite voters were split on whether \u201claw and order\u201d or the coronavirus pandemic were more important to their vote.

            "article_content": "Turning Point USA spokesperson Rob Smith calls out Democratic leaders for normalizing protesters' behavior. Black Lives Matter has become a major political force during this intense election year, getting favorable coverage in the left-wing media as its foot soldiers have been at the center of violent riots, looting, protests and other unrest breaking out in recent months. But while BLM claims to benefit Black Americans, the truth is that it actually hurts us. BLM\u2019s cult-like tactics are more like those of a violent gang than a traditional civil rights group fighting against racial discrimination. The organization refuses to acknowledge the Black lives lost in the violence it has engaged in. It refuses to acknowledge the tragedy of Black lives lost to criminals. It focuses solely on far smaller number of Black people injured or killed in encounters with police. Growing numbers of Black Americans are starting to wake up to this hypocrisy. Do most Black people actually support Black Lives Matter? I address\u00a0this\u00a0question in the newest episode of my podcast\u00a0\u201cRob Smith Is Problematic.\u201d DEMS DON\u2019T HAVE \u2018MORAL COURAGE\u2019 TO CALL OUT BLM PROTESTERS HARASSING DINERS: ROB SMITH BLM has established itself as the prism through which Blacks in America view ourselves \u2014 and is attempting to define us. The message we are getting is: if you are a Black American and you are not completely on board with every single thing that is done or said to advocate for this organization, then you are not Black, or you are not Black enough, or you hate yourself. This is absurd. I have a problem with this because there should be no organization or movement that has that much power over any group of people. I was born Black and will always be Black. No one has the right to tell me that my race requires me to support a certain group, cause, political ideology or candidate. Just as White people have every right to hold a wide range of beliefs, Black people do as well. No race is monolithic. Black Lives Matters supporters taking to the streets, screaming in the faces of white diners attempting to enjoy a meal outside, breaking into stores, looting, setting fires and engaging in other acts of physical violence aren\u2019t movement members. They\u2019re criminals. BLM is their cult. It is their religion. It is what gives them purpose. And that should make Americans of\u00a0any\u00a0color deeply uncomfortable. BLM also traffics in \u201cdefund the police\u201d rhetoric that sounds\u00a0amazing\u00a0to liberal elites who live in gated communities and luxury high-rises \u2014 but is far less appealing to Black people who live\u00a0in crime-ridden communities. Yes, structural issues and disparities in policing exist. Yes, some Black people have been unjustly injured and killed by police. And yes, any officer who engages in police brutality or unjustified violence toward anyone should be charged and prosecuted to the full extent the law allows. But far more Black people have been protected by police from criminals than have been killed by police. So the question is: how do we\u00a0fix the problems that have resulted in the wrongful treatment of some African Americans while at the same time offering protection to the vast majority of Black people, who are law-abiding citizens? Black Lives Matters supporters taking to the streets, screaming in the faces of white diners attempting to enjoy a meal outside, breaking into stores, looting, setting fires and engaging in other acts of physical violence aren\u2019t movement members. They\u2019re criminals. First, we need realistic and specific policy changes to prevent police misconduct toward anyone, including toward Black people. But defunding the police will not reduce police misconduct\u2014 it would actually hurt Black Americans far more than it would help us. Defunding the police would result in police cutting the number of officers patrolling neighborhoods and responding to crimes. That\u2019s great news for criminals of all races \u2014 it means they have a lower chance of being caught and can commit more crimes. But defunding the police is terrible news for crime victims \u2014 and many crime victims are Black and live in low-income neighborhoods. A Black woman who is raped, a Black parent who sees a child shot and killed in a robbery, or a Black store owner who sees his business looted and burned are not going to rejoice because these crimes were committed by criminals rather than police officers. Yet we see no BLM rallies and marches for Black crime victims, including murder victims. Don\u2019t those Black lives matter? Where are the posters demanding justice for\u00a0these\u00a0people? The truth is that the tragic loss of these Black lives can\u2019t be used to further the radical BLM agenda, so the organizations ignores them. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Professional activists make money fundraising for Black Lives Matter. Black journalists are accepted in media circles as \u201cauthentic\u201d because they don\u2019t dare question BLM\u2019s hypocrisy and victim narrative. Ambulance-chasing lawyers make millions off the pain of families reeling from the loss of relatives \u2014 a loss that is usually avoidable. But Black Lives Matter does nothing to benefit the vast majority of Black Americans. It makes them hate police officers. It turns the real world into an alternate universe in which evil White cops are hunting them down the moment they leave the safety of their homes. And BLM emboldens people who push ridiculous rhetoric and don\u2019t care one bit that it makes the lives of\u00a0average Black people \u2014 not rich entertainers, athletes and media personalities \u2014 more dangerous. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Black Lives Matter is here to stay. The many millions of dollars the organization has raised in the past few months will ensure that. The question is: who benefits? Certainly not the Black cops trying to protect everyone in their communities, despite the insults they get and the risks they face of getting badly hurt or killed. Certainly not the people who see their communities becoming less safe because of anti-police rhetoric. And certainly not the families of the Black people murdered by criminals every day, who look at Black Lives Matter and wonder when the lives of\u00a0their\u00a0lost loved ones will matter as well.

But it is to say that they are not complete.\u00a0And in both history and current events we all tend to emphasize causes or characteristics that reinforce our worldviews.\nIf you believe that the French Revolution and what followed was a disaster for Europe, blaming Revanchism for\u00a0Adolf Hitler\u00a0is a nice fit. If you believe capitalism is to blame for America\u2019s woes, pinning revitalized slavery on\u00a0Eli Whitney\u00a0sews things up quite neatly.\u00a0Again, those explanations are not untrue, but they are incomplete. And we must always force ourselves to consider how our own biases interfere with our assessments of causes and effects. Failing to do so prevents us from understanding how we got here and what to do next. If you don\u2019t know why the lights come on, you may not want to start rewiring your house.\nWitness how the current administration\u2019s misunderstanding of the events and election of 1968 led to decisions and statements that have worsened the incumbent\u2019s political fortunes rather than improved them.\u00a0Richard Nixon\u00a0was calling, yes, for law and order but he was also the former vice president calling for calm and a return to a less chaotic time in the previous administration. The embattled incumbent and his party were the ones dispatching the armed forces to American cities.\nThe events of the past week have caused us to face a serious question of causation: Why do we continue to see cases of deadly police brutality against African Americans, like the one that claimed the life of\u00a0George Floyd?Now, if you\u2019re an all-one-thing kind of person, you will have a quick answer, maybe even accompanied by a scoff.\nYou may say that it\u2019s because of institutional racism inherent in American policing. Today\u2019s police forces, in this view, are the armed enforcers of a deeper racism that has shaped everything about our nation since before its founding. White fears of black insurrection cause police to treat black suspects differently as a rule.Or you may say that it\u2019s because black men commit so many crimes that police are bound to have a disproportionately high number of interactions with them compared to the rest of the population. That would also make the probability higher that black offenders would encounter the limited number of corrupt or racist officers much higher.\nAnd you could, with eyes rolled, stop thinking about it.You could say: Police are the shock troops of a racist system intent on denying black Americans full citizenship ----> Killing back suspects is part of their work and will only be ended when policing as we know it is ended.Or you could say: The population of black males in America comprises a large number of violent offenders ----> Isolated abuses in confronting lawlessness are unfortunate but unavoidable.\nAnd many Americans are letting themselves off easy in these ways. They can believe a part answer and then signal their total support for an incomplete or misleading explanation and close their ears to anything that undercuts it.\nBut that won\u2019t change the facts.\nViolent, murderous racism\u00a0is real. And so is the subtler kind that can pervade organizations, even when participants aren\u2019t cognizant.\nBut it is also real that police kill black suspects at a rate lower than white suspects. A\u00a02019 study\u00a0published by the National Academy of Sciences found \u201cno evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings.\u201dThere are more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies of all sizes across the country. Some are corrupt, and some are havens for racist attitudes. In many places, police unions and machine politics protect bad cops.\nThere are about 15 million adult African American males \u2013 something like 7 percent of the adult population. It is a group responsible for a widely disproportionate percentage of violent crimes and lags other groups on positive indicators like employment and educational attainment.\nYou can look at the facts and ask interesting, useful questions about why things are this way. You can challenge your own assumptions about white racism or criminal behavior. You can think deeply about how your own assumptions might distort your ideas about cause and effect.\nOr you can just throw something up on Instagram to show your solidarity with one ill-defined side or another and call it a day.THE RULEBOOK: SELF-MADE\u201cIt is evident that no other form [of government] would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 39TIME OUT: FOR THE LOVE OF ONIONSGarden & Gun: \u201cCall it providence, luck, or low sulfur levels\u2014the sweetness of Vidalia onions is a godsend. In 1931, so the story goes, when the farmer\u00a0Moses Coleman\u00a0planted yellow onions on his Toombs County acreage, the sandy South Georgia soil turned the bulbs sweet. Today, Vidalias, which are harvested each year beginning in April and hit their peak in late May and June, are so beloved that the state has gone to great lengths to keep them rare; the Vidalia Onion Act of 1986 regulates the allium and its growers and sellers. \u2018To be a Vidalia, it has to be grown in the designated growing region in Georgia\u2014and in Georgia alone,\u2019 says\u00a0Gary Black, the state\u2019s commissioner of agriculture. Registered growers harvest their crop from twenty contiguous counties around Vidalia, a little town up the road from Moses Coleman\u2019s farm. \u2018There\u2019s also rules and regulations on how a packinghouse is set up. The onions can\u2019t mingle with other varieties during Vidalia season,\u2019 Black says.\u201dFlag on the play?\u00a0- Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\u00a0PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(186 electoral votes)\u00a0Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(249 electoral votes)[Full rankings\u00a0here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\u00a042.4 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a054.4 percentNet Score:\u00a0-12 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2193\u00a03.6 points[Average includes: CBS News: 40 % approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; ABC News/WaPo: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; American Research Group: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 54% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Ms. Murkowski said the critique by General Mattis, in which he said that Mr. Trump had divided the nation and failed to lead, was overdue and might be a tipping point that would cause Republicans to air concerns about the president that they had only spoken about privately. \u2018I was really thankful,\u2019 Ms. Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u2018I thought General Mattis\u2019s words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.\u2019 The comments by Ms. Murkowski, one of the few moderate Republicans in Congress who has been willing to break with Mr. Trump, suggested that his response to nationwide unrest over police brutality and racial discrimination had prodded at least some members of the party to reconsider their support for him.\u201dYuval Levin:\u00a0\u2018The Evils of Injustice and the Danger of Mobocracy\u2019 -\u00a0National Review: \u201cIn recent days, my mind has turned to\u00a0Abraham Lincoln\u2014maybe the greatest of the great-souled Americans. I\u2019ve thought of him not only because he thought and acted with such moral clarity regarding the evil of racism and the inhumanity of slavery, but also because he understood that no just society was possible without respect for basic social order. He knew there was an ideal of justice above the law, and he knew that it could only be respected and put into effect through the law, not around it. \u2026 We incline to worry about angry mobs out of fear that they will harm the innocent, but Lincoln argued that even when their cause is understandable (even when, as in one of his examples, they are rightly livid at \u2018the perpetration of an outrageous murder\u2019), their lawlessness is a grave danger, because they ultimately liberate \u2018the lawless in spirit\u2026to become lawless in practice,\u2019 and then leave good citizens with no choice but to become lawless in their own defense.\u201dThe Judge\u2019s Ruling: \u2018America is under attack from three deadly viruses\u2019 -\u00a0Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0takes the national temperature in his column this week: \u201cAmerica is under attack by three deadly viruses. COVID-19 has killed more than 107,000 Americans since March. Yet, it pales in comparison to the virus it provoked -- hubris. And that, in turn, provoked the virus that has bedeviled America since the 17th century -- racism.\u201d Read it all\u00a0here.AMID RE-ELECTION WOES, TRUMP CALLS CAMPAIGN TO CARPETBloomberg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump has summoned top political advisers including his re-election campaign manager,\u00a0Brad Parscale, for a White House meeting as his political standing erodes in key battleground states, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser,\u00a0Jared Kushner, who is the de facto leader of his re-election effort, will also participate, the people said, as will Deputy Campaign Manager\u00a0Bill Stepien\u00a0and Trump\u2019s top pollster,\u00a0Tony Fabrizio. One of the people said it\u2019s expected to be a tense meeting, describing internal polls that show Trump performing poorly in politically competitive states across the country. The people asked not to be identified because the meeting isn\u2019t on Trump\u2019s public schedule for the day. Trump\u2019s chief of staff\u00a0Mark Meadows\u00a0is also in the meeting, another person said.\u201dInternal campaign polling alarms Team Trump -\u00a0NYT: \u201cIn private polling conducted by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the president is now well behind Mr. Biden, according to people briefed on the most recent round of results. Multiple public surveys this week have found Mr. Trump trailing Mr. Biden, the former vice president, by double-digit margins, including a Monmouth University poll published on Wednesday that showed Mr. Biden ahead by 11 percentage points. The presidential election is still five months away and Mr. Trump, despite his political vulnerability, retains some important assets as a candidate. While Mr. Biden\u2019s fund-raising efforts have picked up momentum, Mr. Trump is sitting on a considerably larger war chest and is resuming in-person fund-raising next week. There is almost no open dissent within the Republican Party, giving Mr. Trump a solid political foundation on the right from which he can attempt to rebuild his strength before the fall campaign.\u201dBiden nearly doubles Wisconsin lead -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cMajorities of Wisconsin voters rate the economy negatively and are concerned about coronavirus.\u00a0That helps explain Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s gains in the presidential race, in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters released Wednesday. Biden has a 9-point edge over President Donald Trump, 49-40 percent. That\u2019s up from a 5-point advantage in January, and is outside the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error.\u00a0 Another 11 percent are uncommitted. A big reason Trump trails Biden is lack of party support: 85 percent of Republicans back him, while 93 percent of Democrats support Biden.\u00a0 Eight percent of Republicans defect to Biden.\u00a0 In addition, only 87 percent of those who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance support his reelection.\u201dOhio back to swing state status as Biden holds narrow lead -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cA Fox News Poll of Ohio registered voters finds Democrat Joe Biden narrowly tops President Donald Trump in the race for the White House.\u00a0 At the same time, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine enjoys sky-high, bipartisan approval. Biden is ahead of Trump by a 45 to 43 percent margin. The former vice president\u2019s 2-point edge is within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error. Voters extremely interested in the election go for Biden by 6 points (51-45 percent). More Democrats (61 percent) than Republicans (55 percent) are extremely interested in the election.\u201dBiden up 4 in Arizona, McSally getting shellacked -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cRepublicans are rightly concerned about Arizona. A new Fox News Poll finds the state shading blue -- especially in the race for the U.S. Senate, where Democrat\u00a0Mark Kelly\u00a0bests incumbent Republican Sen.\u00a0Martha McSally\u00a0by a 50-37 percent margin among Arizona registered voters. The story here is party loyalty. Some 88 percent of Democrats back Kelly, while just 73 percent of Republicans support McSally.\u00a0 Fully 13 percent of those backing President Trump in the presidential race cross over and go for Kelly. Gov.\u00a0Doug Ducey\u00a0appointed McSally after the 2018 retirement of Sen. John McCain\u2019s successor,\u00a0Jon Kyl. In a head-to-head presidential ballot test, Democrat Joe Biden edges President Donald Trump by 46-42 percent.\u00a0 Another 11 percent are still up for grabs. Biden\u2019s 4-point advantage is within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error.\u201dTexas tight, but undecideds aplenty -\u00a0Quinnipiac University: \u201cPresident Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are locked in a very tight race in Texas, with Trump receiving 44 percent of the vote and Biden receiving 43 percent in a general election matchup, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released [Wednesday]. Democrats go for Biden 90 - 5 percent, independents do the same 45 - 36 percent, and Republicans go for Trump 87 - 6 percent. Voters say 54 - 40 percent that Trump would do a better job handling the economy, but say 49 - 43 percent that Biden would do a better job handling health care. Voters are split on who would do a better job handling the response to the coronavirus, as 47 percent say Biden and 45 percent say Trump.\u201dTrump approval on race relations hits 33 percent -\u00a0CBS News: \u201cPresident Trump's overall approval rating stands at 40% and disapproval is 54% \u2014 both within the historically narrow range in which they vary; neither his lowest nor highest numbers. As always, given high marks from Republicans and faring worse among others. Even fewer approve of his handling of race relations specifically, at 33%. Here again, his own party bolsters the numbers, with 72% of Republicans approving. African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the president's overall job performance and his handling of race relations. The public has similarly negative views on the president's response to the situation in Minneapolis: 31% are satisfied with it, while 55% dissatisfied with it.\u201dBIDEN FACES BACKLASH FROM POLICE UNIONSPolitico: \u201cJoe Biden has long prided himself on being a union-friendly Democrat with a good relationship with rank-and-file cops. But Biden\u2019s call for more national policing reforms and oversight in the wake of the death of George Floyd \u2014 and the perception that he hasn\u2019t shown enough solidarity with law enforcement amid the ensuing nationwide protests and unrest \u2014 have created a fissure with law enforcement groups, leaving many who once supported him frustrated by what they regard as political posturing by their one-time ally. \u2018Clearly, he\u2019s made a lot of changes the way candidates do during the primary process, but he kept moving left and fell off the deep end,\u2019 said\u00a0Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, the umbrella organization for Police Benevolent Association chapters. \u2026 As the two presidential candidates confront one of the most racially combustible moments in recent history, they are taking decidedly different tacks.\u201dBernie bros not so friendly -\u00a0Politico: \u201cBernie world is tearing itself apart. As election results across the country rolled in on Tuesday evening, current and former aides to Bernie Sanders abruptly laced into each other on social media, trading accusations of being \u2018tone-deaf,\u2019 not giving \u2018a shit about the base,\u2019 and even stealing infrastructure from the 2020 campaign. The clashes made public tensions that had long simmered below the surface among different factions in Sanders\u2019 team during the primary. But they also demonstrated how difficult it is for top Sanders lieutenants to control even their own former staffers, which could hamper efforts at party unity during the general election. For progressives and ex-Sanders staffers worried about how to keep the movement alive after the Vermont senator dropped out of the primary, the feud set off a round of soul-searching since it came against the backdrop of nationwide civil unrest and protests against police brutality.\u201dOcasio-Cortez backs Engel\u2019s challenger in primary -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cDespite a less-than-stellar record on past endorsements, Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that she was going to throw her support behind Rep.\u00a0Eliot Engel\u2019s primary challenger. \u2018This moment requires renewed and revitalized leadership across the country AND at the ballot box,\u2019 she tweeted, as she lent her support to\u00a0Jamaal Bowman, an educator. Earlier this year, Ocasio-Cortez announced the Courage to Change PAC, which was seen at the time as a threat to established Democrats. Despite her freshman status in the House, she is popular and her endorsement is seen as a gateway to the younger vote. Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, once called Ocasio-Cortez one of the most powerful politicians in Washington. She called Bowman, who is African-American, \u2018a profound community leader.\u2019 Engel\u2019s district has mostly black and Hispanic voters.\u201dTWO MILLION MORE LAYOFFS HINT AT DIRE LABOR REPORTPolitico: \u201cU.S. workers filed another 1.9 million new claims for unemployment benefits last week, the Department of Labor reported. The coronavirus pandemic has forced roughly 42.6 million workers onto jobless rolls in just 11 weeks. Another 623,000 people applied for benefits under the new temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program created for people who are ineligible for traditional unemployment benefits, suggesting the number of claims filed last week could be higher than 2 million. But there is likely some overlap between the claims reported for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and normal state programs. \u2018Even as states reopen, claims in the millions are an indicator that the economic pain of the COVID-19 crisis is still acute,\u2019 Glassdoor Senior Economist\u00a0Daniel Zhao\u00a0said in reaction to the claims number.\u201dGOP under pressure to extend unemployment benefits -\u00a0Politico: \u201cForty million Americans are unemployed and extra unemployment benefits expire at the end of next month. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are grappling with deep ideological divisions over what to do with the popular program in the middle of a pandemic and an election year. Most Republicans have roundly rejected the House Democrats\u2019 approach of extending a $600 weekly boost to unemployment checks though January 2021, and some say the enhanced benefits may need to end altogether. Sen.\u00a0Pat Toomey\u00a0(R-Pa.) said \u2018it might\u2019 need to go back to the normal state unemployment benefits, and Sen.\u00a0Rand Paul\u00a0(R-Ky.) said the additional funds were a \u2018terrible idea [that] never should have passed in the first place.\u2019 Many Republicans think the extra money makes it less enticing for Americans to go back to work \u2014 already a concern for people considering the dangers of being infected by coronavirus in the workplace.\u201dAUDIBLE: LIFT THE SHADOW\u201cProgress comes when people treat one another with respect, as if we were color-blind. Unless and until we are honest that race is still an anchor around our country\u2019s neck, that shadow will never be lifted.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Condoleezza Rice\u00a0in an opinion\u00a0piece\u00a0for the WaPo.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cChris, honest question, with all of the predictable blame-assigning in recent days arising from the horrific homicide of George Floyd, there is one group I have not yet heard anyone mention - the police union. Derek Chauvin was a police officer with 18 prior complaints investigated by Internal Affairs, two of which resulted in discipline. There is no way to know if some of the complaints were reduced in severity as a part of a settlement. At minimum, Chauvin seems, over the years, to have had issues in doing his job professionally. I understand that Chief Arradando, appointed following another high-profile police shooting in 2017, seems well regarded and sincere in his reform plan for the department\u2019s relationship to the community. Assuming Arradondo\u2019s efforts included eliminating \u2018bad apples\u2019 from the force, I wonder to what extent the police union might make it difficult to impossible to remove a problematic sworn officer from such a powerful position in which he can do so much harm? This seems like it could be an issue in other locales as well.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jim Snave, Wilmington, N.C.[Ed. note: Since the days when\u00a0Calvin Coolidge\u00a0as governor of Massachusetts broke the Boston police strike, police unions have been one of the stickiest wickets in American public life. Through most of the 20th century, Democratic leaders in big cities sided with police unions not just on increased pay and benefits but also on discipline. Like other government-worker unions, they were part of machines that protected the existing power structure. It wasn\u2019t until this week that Philadelphia took down a hideously heroic statue of\u00a0Frank Rizzo, the former police commissioner turned mayor who famously told his supporters to \u201cvote white.\u201d As cities changed radically in the ensuing decades, the relationship became more fraught and Republicans, especially big-city GOPers of an authoritarian bent, found common cause. The power of police unions is not just in contributions and endorsements, but their power to undercut elected officials. No one, Republican or Democrat, would like to run for office branded as soft on crime. But on the other hand, without organization, police officers have often been subject to abuses by civilian leaders and politically-motivated changes to standards and procedures. City leaders have long struggled with finding the right balance between protecting the members of the thin blue line and holding officers accountable.]\u201cIn light of the current racial tensions I have been thinking about your argument that the number of House of Representatives should be increased so that each Representative actually represents fewer people. Do you think this would help minorities have a louder voice in the House, because the districts would be smaller and the Reps closer to the population they represent? How big does it need to be so that this theory is effective? This would also increase the Electoral College, correct? Would that benefit some States over the others? My initial thought was no, because the Reps would still be allocated based on population so the Electoral Votes would still be basically the same percentage per State. I realize that having more/better representation in government is not the solution to racial tensions & racism, but I do think it could be a puzzle piece of the solution.\u00a0 We can at least start a conversation on how we can help our fellow Americans be heard. God Bless.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Colleen Mansuetto, Cleveland[Ed. note: Wow, Ms. Mansuetto! I hadn\u2019t even thought about that one. Good looking out!

That means certain elective medical procedures could resume, including Botox injections and cosmetic surgery.\u00a0Michael Salzhauer, a plastic surgeon known as \u2018Dr. Miami\u2019 who has also starred in a reality television show, has been conducting drive-through Botox injections in the garage of his building in the posh Miami neighborhood of Bal Harbour. Salzhauer said the idea struck him as he was sitting in his car waiting for a blood test for COVID-19 antibodies. \u2018The areas that we inject Botox are the upper face, exactly the parts of the face that aren\u2019t covered by the mask so it\u2019s really ideal,\u2019 Salzhauer said, while wearing a mask, face shield and surgical gown as he waited for his next drive-up patient.

Black Americans face many problems today \u2013 disproportionate deaths and job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a higher poverty rate, continuing discrimination, substandard housing and schools in many cities, and much more. But alleged racism by former Vice President Joe Biden isn\u2019t one of our problems. Unfortunately, a rhetorical slip by Biden in an interview with a black radio talk show host Friday is being blown out of all proportion by supporters of President Trump in an effort to score political points. The Trump supporters think black people aren\u2019t smart enough to realize Biden\u2019s poor choice of words was a largely insignificant incident. Well, guess what. Black folks aren\u2019t stupid. JOE BIDEN EXPRESSES REGRET OVER 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' COMMENTS: \u2018I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO CAVALIER' We know that former Vice President Biden is no stranger to the black community. We know he has spent years working on issues that black voters care a great deal about, including voting rights, investments in public education, and ending the injustices facing communities of color. We know that Biden is not a racist. Not only has he stood in the gap for civil and human rights, but he spent eight years working side-by-side with the first African-American president \u2013 Barack Obama \u2013 to build a legacy of decency, respect, and economic stability. Vice President Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee because black voters know him, his record, and his commitment to making our country more fair and just. Beyond that, the Biden campaign is clearly extremely committed to engaging with and answering questions from black-owned and operated media, like \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d program where he was interviewed Friday. During Biden\u2019s 18-minute interview with Charlemagne tha God, Biden responded to every question. He discussed some of his plans for black America including restoring voting rights, raising wages, and increasing access to high-quality health care. He also discussed his intent to consider a woman of color as his running mate. Biden\u2019s mistake, which he later apologized for, was to tell Charlemagne \u2013 in a poor attempt at humor: \u201cI tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d The Trump team\u2019s desperate attempt to magnify Biden\u2019s verbal misstep into a major campaign issue is laughable. Biden shouldn\u2019t have made the comment, and he apologized for it later in the day, saying: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy \u2026. No one should have to vote for any party, based on their race or religion or background.\u201d Biden is right about that. But to say his poor attempt at humor erases his sterling record on issues important to black people over many decades is ridiculous. Does the former vice president have some blemishes on his record when dealing with the black community? Of course. Does Trump have blemishes \u2013 make that gaping holes \u2013 on his record on black issues as well? Yes, and his shortcoming dwarf Biden\u2019s. Should Biden apologize for writing the 1994 crime bill and ushering in a new wave of harsh policing and mass incarceration? Absolutely, and in the future he must do better. Should Trump apologize for his far worse actions? You bet, but don\u2019t expect to ever hear an apology cross the president\u2019s lips. He wants us to believe he has never made a mistake and never done anything wrong. Black voters are extraordinarily pragmatic and are not going to be swayed to change their votes by an inappropriate comment from the former vice president on a radio show. These voters, just like most Americans, are examining candidates and their records to see who can best lead this nation, especially during the COVID-19 crisis and recovery. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns could benefit from engaging black America more comprehensively, and this current pandemic crisis demands it. Presidential elections are about contrast \u2013 one candidate against another. As of today, the difference couldn't be more apparent. Yes, Biden has made several missteps in his choice of words and his past policy positions, but the past three months of Trump\u2019s incompetent mishandling of the coronavirus crisis will carry more weight in voters' minds than Biden\u2019s fumbled choice of words. During this crisis, we have witnessed the dangerous combination of ineffective leadership by Trump and stifling social inequities and how this impacts American lives. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As a member of the African-American community, I am the creator and gatekeeper of my own blackness. Biden\u2019s social faux pas does not define my sense of blackness or my sense of self. It is much more important for us to focus on all of the death and societal panic that have resulted from the Trump administration and its lack of coronavirus tests, its failure to provide adequate amounts of personal protective equipment for health care workers, and its mindless rush to reopen America without consideration for scientific guidance or flattening the curve of COVID-19 rates. A recent Fox News Poll found that American voters favor Joe Biden over President Trump by nearly nine points. In that same poll, Trump's approval rating eroded eight points due to his dismal performance during this COVID-19 pandemic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These poll numbers make it abundantly clear that voters are far more concerned about a global pandemic than they are about a 30-second viral clip of Biden\u2019s poorly stated comment. The Trump team\u2019s desperate attempt to magnify Biden\u2019s verbal misstep into a major campaign issue is laughable. Black voters are too smart to fall for this distraction.

The Mattel doll got animated about addressing racial bias and\u00a0discrimination in a new video posted on the Barbie YouTube page, in a discussion with her pal Nikki, a Black doll. \u201cThere is a huge movement going on. Millions of people across the world are standing up to fight against racism, and they\u2019re doing this because too often and for such a long time, people have been treated unfairly, and in some cases even hurt by others, because of the color of their skin,\u201d Barbie says in the video, while seated next to Nikki. Nikki then speaks up about her experiences being discriminated against as a young Black woman, illustrating her point with a story about a\u00a0sticker-selling contest. \u201cBarbie and I had a sticker-selling contest on the beach last month. We split up and went our separate directions to see who could sell the most. While I was on the boardwalk, beach security stopped me three times,\" Nikki tells Barbie. \"The security officer thought I was doing something bad, even though I was doing exactly the same thing that you were doing.\u201d Nikki then shares another story, recalling the time a teacher told her she \u201cgot lucky\u201d after acing a French entrance exam, and she said it\u00a0deterred her from joining a French honor club. When Barbie asked why she didn\u2019t join the club to \u201cprove [the teacher]\u00a0wrong\u201d Nikki said: \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to constantly prove and reprove myself.\" \"He supported you right from the beginning and he didn\u2019t support me.

The San Diego Unified School District last week approved a major overhaul to its grading system as a part of a larger effort to combat racial discrimination. The new changes came in response to data that showed disparities between the percentage of white and minority students who received D or F grades, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. A racial disparity in failing grades has prompted the San Diego Unified School District to overhaul its entire grading system. (nj.gov) According to the data, Black students accounted for about 20% of all D or F grades during the first semester of last year, while Native American and Hispanic students each accounted for 23%. By comparison, white students made up 7% of all D or F grades during that same period. Under the district\u2019s new system, non-academic factors like late work and classroom behavior will not be counted toward their overall academic grade.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said that while U.S. law enforcement saw instances of police abusing their power, it was inaccurate to say that policing as a whole was systemically racist. His comments came during an Axios interview published Tuesday, in which journalist Mike Allen asked whether there was problem with systemic racism in American policing. \"Absolutely not,\" Wolf replied. \"Do we have individuals in the law enforcement community that probably abuse their authority? We saw that in\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s death. But we see that around the country, absolutely, and they should be held accountable.\" \"But this idea that we have systemic racism is not accurate in my view,\" he added. He said the justice system \"moved very quickly\" in the Floyd case where each of the involved officers were arrested and charged with multiple offenses. BARR SAYS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S SYSTEMIC RACISM IN US POLICING Floyd's death sparked nationwide Black Lives Matter protests and prompted calls to transfer police funds to social services. Wolf's department was involved in quelling some of the related protests in Portland, Ore. last month. Amid accusations of systemic racism, the Trump administration has repeatedly said that label doesn't apply to U.S. law enforcement. \u201cI don\u2019t agree there\u2019s systemic racism in the police department, generally, in this country,\u201d Attorney General William Barr told Congress last month.\u00a0In his opening statement, Barr said it was \"understandable\" that African Americans harbored distrust towards the police, and acknowledged perceptions of bias during police encounters. \"At the same time, I think it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem as rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments,\" he\u00a0added. JAMES CARAFANO: CANCEL CULTURE'S NEXT TARGET: DEFUNDING DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Barr's comments came as House Democrats passed policing reform legislation that has been\u00a0painted\u00a0as a way to address systemic racism. The\u00a0Justice in Policing Act of 2020\u00a0includes coooperation from Barr's department, including in the creation of a task force overseeing law enforcement in the U.S. After the bill's passage, Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass\u00a0said:\u00a0\"For far too long, Black Americans have endured systemic racism and discrimination\u2014especially from police. Congress may have written this bill, but the people own it.\" Data\u00a0compiled by\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reveals that Black people, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 25 percent of those shot and killed by police since 2015; White people, accounting for 60 percent of the population, accounted for 45 percent of those killed by police officers. But some have questioned that framing of the issue, pointing to the circumstances surrounding Floyd's death as well as crime rates in the Black community. Heather Mac Donald, a scholar at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, has pushed back on the idea of systemic racism. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed from June, she\u00a0wrote:\u00a0\"A solid body of evidence finds no structural bias in the criminal-justice system with regard to arrests, prosecution or sentencing. Crime and suspect behavior, not race, determine most police actions.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She cited an August 2019\u00a0study\u00a0from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"We find no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings,\" the authors concluded, \"and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers. Instead, race-specific crime strongly predicts civilian race. This suggests that increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings.\" Regardless, the issue will likely play a substantial role in the election. Former Vice President Joe Biden has already campaigned on the issue, releasing a plan to deal with systemic racism in a variety of areas. His website reads: \"He will be unflinching in confronting the systemic racism in our country that is built into our laws, our policies, and our institutions and will take aggressive action to correct them\u2014ripping out the inequities in housing, health care, education, the economy, our criminal justice system, and so many other areas.\"",

            "article_content": "Some Democratic insiders fear Joe Biden's delay in naming running mate will harm the eventual pick; reaction from Fox News contributor Donna Brazile, former DNC interim chair. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence famously proclaimed that \u201call men are created equal\u201d \u2014 but in reality, it meant only White men. The enslavement of Black people did not end until the close of the Civil War in 1865, and women weren\u2019t granted the right to vote until 1920. Yet legalized voting discrimination against Black Americans and other minorities persisted until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. And even today, President Trump and Republicans are seeking to throw up new roadblocks to voting \u2014 such as the president\u2019s baseless attacks against mail-in voting as the coronavirus pandemic rages, and Republican efforts to suppress minority votes in other ways. Obviously, much progress has been made in combatting racism and sexism since our nation\u2019s founding, but these two forms of discrimination still hold back many people of color and women from achieving their full potential \u2014 and our entire nation suffers as a result. JILL BIDEN PROMISES HER HUSBAND WILL DEBATE TRUMP THIS FALL, IS 'CLOSE' TO CHOOSING RUNNING MATE Former Vice President Joe Biden recognizes the need to open the doors to the American Dream wider. As a result, he has committed to selecting a woman as his vice presidential running mate when he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee later this month. Many nations have already been led by female presidents and prime ministers, and women have held the No. 2 spots in many countries as well. Biden\u2019s decision to select a woman to become his vice president if he is elected president is an important sign of progress on the long road to true equality. Wisely, Biden understands that a nation needs to take advantage of the talents of all its people. I\u2019m an enthusiastic supporter of Biden\u2019s candidacy, and will remain so whomever he chooses to run with him. But my advice to him is to break two glass ceilings at once by selecting a Black woman as his vice presidential pick. There are plenty of talented Black women to choose from, and any one of them could boost Biden\u2019s election chances, be a valuable governing partner, and help him create a more inclusive America where all people are treated as equals. Biden has repeatedly said that he wants \u201csomeone strong,\u201d someone \u201cwho is ready to be president on Day One,\u201d and someone who is \u201ctotally simpatico\u201d with him philosophically to be his running mate. What exactly does this mean? It means Biden wants to pick a person who is eminently qualified to be president right now. But what qualifies as \u201cqualified\u201d in these terrible times, when more than 155,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID-19, tens of millions are recently unemployed, and millions have taken to the streets to protest police brutality and racial inequality? I believe that a Democratic ticket that looks and sounds like America \u2014 that is both representative of our country\u2019s tremendous diversity and able to heal its divides \u2014 is needed to put us back on the path to greatness. Our current president and vice president have failed the test of leadership again and again The healing is desperately needed to repair the grave damage President Trump has done to our nation and the American people with his incompetent leadership, harmful policies, and stoking of divisions among the American people since he assumed office in January 2017. In all of American history, only three women have been major political party nominees for president or vice president. In 1984, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., was the first woman vice presidential nominee, when former Democratic Sen. and Vice President Walter Mondale chose her as his running mate. I was honored to be a part of the staff for the Mondale-Ferraro campaign, which ended with the election of Republican Ronald Reagan as president. In 2008, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska became the first woman vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona chose her as his running mate The Barack Obama-Joe Biden Democratic ticket defeated McCain-Palin. And in 2016, former Sen. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first woman major party presidential nominee, capturing the Democratic nomination. She won about 3 million more popular votes than Donald Trump, but Trump was elected because he won in the Electoral College. It\u2019s a sad commentary that in all of American history only three women \u2014 all of them White\u2014have been serious contenders for the nation\u2019s two highest offices. The late Rep. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y., was the first Black woman elected to the House of Representatives and in1972 became the first Black woman to seek a major party presidential nomination. But her badly underfunded candidacy never got off the ground because few people thought it was possible for a Black person or a woman to be elected president \u2014 let alone someone who fit both categories. \u201cWhen I ran for Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being Black,\u201d Chisholm said years later. \u201cMen are men.\u201d In fact, there have been only two serious Black Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 both of them men: the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988; and the victorious Barack Obama, elected president in 2008 and reelected in 2012. Today some of the strongest, most qualified, and most ready leaders in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 and in the fight for racial equality and for an economy that works for everyone \u2014 include women of color. Let\u2019s start with the fight against the coronavirus. In a fascinating article published in The New York Times in May, we learned how the women leading Finland, Germany, New Zealand and Taiwan are handling their countries\u2019 responses to the coronavirus arguably better than their male counterparts in other nations. The article emphasizes that although \u201cwe should resist drawing conclusions about women leaders from a few exceptional individuals acting in exceptional circumstances \u2026 experts say that the women\u2019s success may still offer valuable lessons about what can help countries weather not just this crisis, but others in the future.\u201d This is true both in the global fight against the pandemic and in the United States. Dr. Deborah Birx is a leader in the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is leading the response by the House. Both are helping to direct our country\u2019s response to this crisis with exceptional strength and empathy. Women make up\u00a0more than half of essential workers\u00a0on the front lines fighting the coronavirus pandemic: doctors, nurses, elder care workers, bus drivers, food service providers, and more. Imagine how worse off we would be if the old sexist saying that \u201ca woman\u2019s place is in the home\u201d kept them off the front lines. And women \u2014 and specifically women of color \u2014 are also leaders in the fight for racial equality in our country. This includes my many friends on the Congressional Black Caucus. Black female elected officials, community organizers, and religious leaders truly understand the pain and agony of their fellow Black mothers, daughters, and sisters who have seen family members brutalized and murdered by racist police and an unequal criminal justice system. And Black women are working tirelessly on the streets and in the halls of power, to reform this system and to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Because of the work of so many women on the pandemic and in the fight for racial justice, Biden\u2019s pledge to choose a woman as his vice presidential running mate is more prescient and powerful today than when he made it March 15. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Biden\u2019s early recognition of the need for a Democratic ticket that is representative of the diversity of our country reveals the goodness that is in his heart and the wisdom in his head. Recent polling shows that a majority of millennial, Generation Z, minority women and college-educated white women voters in battleground states believe that a Black woman should be Biden\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Glenda Carr, president and CEO of Higher Heights, the organization that commissioned the poll, said: \u201cNot only are [Black women] building blocks to a winning coalition as voters, we continue to show that Black women candidates can build a diverse coalition of voters.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So my straightforward advice to former Vice President Biden is this: Please pick a Black woman running mate based solely on her strong qualifications to be \u201cpresident on Day One,\u201d her characteristics and values, and her being simpatico with you and your values. Our current president and vice president have failed the test of leadership again and again. A talented Black woman can help Joe Biden send Trump and Vice President Mike Pence into political retirement and help Biden defeat the coronavirus, revive our economy, and heal the wounds of racial division made worse by Donald Trump.

Dr. Swain, you're very, very impressive. For people who don't know, give us a little bit of your background. DR. CAROL SWAIN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY: Well, I'm an American success story. I was one of 12 children born and raised in the rural south. We all dropped out of school after completing the eighth grade. I married at 16 and had my first child by 17. By the time I was 20, I had three small children. And the boys went to a community college and got the first of five degrees and I eventually became a successful University Professor, earned an early tenure at Princeton. I've won national prizes. I've been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court. And I love America. And if you haven't noticed, I'm black. LEVIN: Well, let me ask you some questions and that is a fantastic background. You see what's been going on in this country. You've seen the, the voices on television and heard them. Athletes, the Commissioner of NFL, Hollywood, the Democratic Party on the left, Pelosi and Schumer. First of all, I want to ask you a question. Is this a Civil Rights Movement like the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s that had a specific agenda on equality, voting access, due process, whereas this seems to be, as I say, an insurrection that has as its purpose, the overthrow of the original principles of our government and the overthrow of our economic system? What do you make of this? SWAIN: I think of it -- it's part of the cultural Marxist agenda against America and many of the protesters that are out there, the corporations that are given money, I believe that they are sincere, that they believe that racism in America isn't tolerable, that it hasn't improved, and that black people live their lives in fear. That's a false narrative. And I think it's being push this year because of the election, and I think that the situation with George Floyd that the media, the Democratic Party, Antifa, Black Lives Matter -- all of those groups had an incentive to push and fan the flames so that they -- so that they ended up with what we are experiencing right now. So, we are all suffering as a result of their political agenda, and it will not bring us closer together. LEVIN: You know, Dr. Swain, I look at this, and I have to say you look at these cities, they've been run by one party with an iron fist. Mayor, City Councils, Aldermen for half a century at least. They're in charge of the money that comes into these communities. They're in charge of how it is distributed. That money is laundered through their bureaucracy, their nepotism, their political cronyism. They take no responsibility for what's going on in their cities. They blame other people. They blame systemic racism. Same with these one state, excuse me, one party states -- these Democratic states. And it is amazing to me because you have Nancy Pelosi this week who announced that she wants to remove 11 Confederate statues from Congress and I'm thinking to myself, Dr. Swain, hadn't she been there like 30 years? She's been Speaker twice. She was there when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, and Barack Obama was President and only now she decides to remove 11 Confederate statues. Number one, what is that going to do for the people in these communities? And number two, isn't it for her purely opportunism because she had every opportunity to remove those statues years ago? SWAIN: Well first of all, I'd like for your viewers to know that I was a Democrat up until 2009, but I always had a different perspective on the world. I've always been able to see through things. And so I've known that the Democratic Party was problematic, but I was there, and I've been able to watch them over the years. And it's clear that this whole movement to tear down monuments, I believe it's really focused on dividing the country even further, because the monuments are part of our history. If we can't learn from my history, then we're in trouble. And the whole situation is problematic because with the monuments, this is something that -- there are monuments on all sides. If we start tearing down the monuments, what happens tomorrow when the leaders that we are celebrating today, when those people fall out of favor, it's the wrong path for our nation. It's divisive. It's opportunism. And it's just meant to stir up people that are traditionalist, people that love America, people that are patriotic. LEVIN: I think you're right. The notion that we're going to now tear down all of the Confederate statues because Americans worship these generals. Americans don't worship these generals, Americans mostly despise these generals. They don't even know who the hell they are. And the fact is, you're going to start pulling down monuments. What comes next? Any of the Founding Fathers who owned slaves and released slaves? What comes next? Books? We already know movies are being affected. Television shows are being pulled off the air. We have this kind of bizarre purging going on. This cleaning up of history going on, when in fact, we actually need to know all of these things as we go into the future. Correct? SWAIN: It's far more important to look at the full picture and not to judge the past by the political correct lens that we use today. LEVIN: Yes, because if we judge the past by the political lens of today, as you point out, then we have a lot of questions asked of the left and the Democratic Party, don't we? For instance -- SWAIN: Yes. LEVIN: How could you have voted for Robert Byrd to be the Democratic Party Majority Leader in the United States Senate when he had been an avowed Klansmen several decades before? That seems to me to be a rational question. Or how could Joe Biden have worked with out of the closet segregationists in the 1970s on various Crime Bills and other issues if we're supposed to cleanse history? Are we supposed to ignore that too? Or may I say this to your, Professor. The Democratic Party, if we're going to purge society of all vestiges of slavery and segregation and racism, was it not the Democratic Party that led the Confederacy? Was not the Democratic Party that gave birth to the Klan? Was it not the Democratic Party that throughout a hundred years after the Civil War, led the effort on segregation and Jim Crow and poll taxes and literacy tests? I understand the Democratic Party has done some good things. But if it's in our DNA, and we are systemically racist, and we're pulling down statues, and we're burning books, and we're removing TV shows, why don't we purge the Democratic Party? Just a rhetorical point to you, Professor. SWAIN: I agree and the Democratic Party also fought against the anti- lynching laws, and if you look at the 1960s, the Democrats have been manipulating black people for a long time, and they pay off the leaders. They pick certain ones in the black community, they pay them off and nothing good trickles down to the masses. The Democratic Party has stood in the way black progress. It is standing in the way right now. And they are using black people to advance a radical agenda that I believe will be destructive to our nation, that it will hurt all of us and it's hurting us right now. LEVIN: And you know, when I look at relatively recent history, I look at 1964, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which was actually quite crucial. You look at the breakdown of the votes in the House of Representatives, 61 percent of Democrats voted for it, 80 percent of Republicans voted for it. In the Senate, which was filibustered, the Democrats 69 percent of Democrats wound up voting for it, 82 percent of Republicans wound up voting for it. And yet, the Democratic Party today claims to take the lead in dealing with what it calls systemic racism -- systemic racism in society, systemic racism in police departments. That the Democrat Party is going to advance equality. You have iconic figures in our culture: Oprah Winfrey, LeBron James. You have the Commissioner of the NFL, pretty much, these are all Democrats all promoting the Democratic Party. Let me circle back. So, is this in many respects, about power and not so much about Civil Rights? SWAIN: It's absolutely about power, and if you go to the Black Lives Matter website, and you click on the link to donate, that money is going to Democratic candidates. It's not really advancing the cause of black people. And I think that it's very problematic that the true statement, the slogan that Black Lives Matter, in the same way that all lives matter, that because the slogan, Black Lives Matter is a true statement, people that want to help blacks and they are white, they're being shamed. They feel like the only way they can show support is to donate money or to acquiesce or get down on their knees before black people, and that's not going to benefit the black community. And this whole move to defund the police, I mean that's ludicrous. That will hurt black people more than any other group. LEVIN: All right, thank you. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEVIN: Welcome back. Dr. Carol Swain, I want to ask you a few questions. You're very experienced. You've lived what people like to theorize about. You are an example of the American dream. When you hear of people who haven't lived the way you have lived in the media, sportscaster, sports, Hollywood talk about a systemically racist society, and so many of them do not live in these communities. Maybe some of them came from these communities. They're in the top one-one hundredth percent of the income group. They live in these communities that are quote-unquote \"systemically racist.\" They send their kids to schools in these communities that are quote-unquote \"systemically racist.\" I'm talking about media figures, sports figures, and so forth. Does that kind of hypocrisy -- again, somebody like you who's come out of an inner city environment -- does that kind of hypocrisy frustrate you? SWAIN: Well, the poverty that I came out of was a rural poverty. And what I've noticed, you know, as a student and as a faculty member, is that a lot of people who have been privileged, whether they're white, black, or Hispanic, the more privileged they are, the more they feel the need, you know, to use that language of systemic racism and I think it's being driven by guilt. They feel guilty because they're prospering. And it's very problematic to me that the people who make public policy, a lot of them have degrees from Ivy League schools, they went to Ivy League schools and prep schools. They know nothing about the topics they're trying to solve. So, they -- maybe they did research. They were in a PhD program. They wrote a dissertation. That's the extent of their knowledge and they're going to make public policy for the nation? That's one of the reasons that we are in trouble. And all of these theories that they put forth, the critical theory, critical feminist theory, critical race theory -- all of that is rooted in Marxism and it's a false narrative, and it has no relationship to truth or reality. LEVIN: And this word Marxism, the fact is the Antifa group, which has done enormous damage to inner city communities over the last couple of weeks is a Marxist anarchist group. The media pretends that they don't exist or they downplay the role. Black Lives Matter in many respects is a very violent group and an anti- Semitic group, at least during its founding, it is part of the BDS Movement. That's never mentioned. People say they stand with Black Lives Matter. We stand for the lives of black people and all people. We do not necessarily -- the world -- certainly not I -- stand with this organization per se. Let me ask you this. School choice. Education is key. Education has been key throughout your life. You're a highly educated woman. In our inner cities, the kind of choice that we have in the rest of the country does not exist. We have an all-powerful labor union, a public sector union called the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. They are tied at the hip with the Democratic Party. They are huge donors to the Democratic Party, nearly exclusively and they work hand in glove. Barack Obama was one of the most outspoken and ardent opponents of school choice, which would allow for America -- the parents of poor kids, especially in violent communities or in communities with bad schools and minority communities to choose working quality schools to send their kids rather than the school down the street if it's not functioning properly, and allows competition -- parochial schools, private schools, charter schools and so forth. Well, the money follows the student just as the money follows the students in college. This to me is a huge Human and Civil Rights issue -- basic education. The NBA is not behind it. The NFL is not behind it. The media are not behind it. Hollywood's not behind it. The Democratic Party like so often in our history is obstructing it. And they talk about the cops unions. What about the teachers unions? What's your take on this? SWAIN: Well, I can tell you that they public opinion polls that I've seen majorities of blacks and Hispanics want school choice and it makes a lot of sense because the people who are making decisions for them, they have school choice. And in those inner city schools, they are crime ridden. Students are afraid to go to school because of the, quote, \"restorative justice\" rooted in Marxism, and it is making it almost impossible for students to be suspended. And in cities that are run by Democrats, they have not gotten rid of that. And so there's lawlessness within the schoolhouse. The teachers are afraid to teach. There's chaos in school, just like it is on the streets. And I think that that's very problematic, and we need school choice, and we need to hold public schools accountable, and whenever Democratic cities want money, they say we have to pay our teachers more. They use the teachers but a lot of that money never reaches the teachers. It's used for administrative purposes. LEVIN: The problem is in these Democratic cities, they have an economic model that is more socialist than capitalist. SWAIN: Yes. LEVIN: They have an all-powerful bureaucracy and they do not allow these kids to get a proper education. The money keeps flowing through the same routes and it does not work. You want true revolutionary change, true drastic reform. You've got to remove these barriers. The one party rule of the public sector teachers union, and bring in more liberty and opportunity and prosperity and education and choice in the communities that haven't seen it in half a century. Doctor, I want to thank you very, very much for being on the program and God bless you. SWAIN: Thank you. LEVIN: We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: This is a Fox News Alert. I'm Ashley Strohmier from New York. The Fulton County Medical Examiner releasing Rayshard Brooks autopsy report listing the cause of death as homicide. According to the report, Brooks died from two gunshot wounds to the back creating organ failure due to blood loss. Protesters flooding the streets of Atlanta last night, this, following the death of Rayshard Brooks at the hands of police. Brooks had fallen asleep in the drive thru-lane of a Wendy's and failed a field sobriety test. He resisted arrest and took one of the officer's tasers. As he was running away, Brooks turned back with the taser in hand, an officer shot and killed him. Protesters then set fire to the Wendy's where Brooks had been killed. In the aftermath, the Atlanta Police Chief has resigned. One officer has been fired and the other placed on administrative duty. I'm Ashley Strohmier. Now back to LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN. LEVIN: Welcome back. Our next guest, Dr. Wilfred Riley, Associate Professor of Political Science at Kentucky State University. He's written a fantastic book, among others, \"Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is selling a Fake Race War.\" Well, Professor, you see what's going on around you. You've been commenting on this. So, let me get right to the crux of the matter. Is there systemic racism in our police departments in the aggregate? DR. WILFRED RILEY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY: Well, systemic or institutional racism as an academic is a phrase that I'm always a bit skeptical of. Now, obviously, if we want to be honest about some of this country's history, there have been systems like criminal sentencing in the past, where until quite recently, you did see discrimination at kind of a broad group targeted level. But very often, this phrase simply means there's a difference in performance between two groups, and we're going to attribute that to racism. And to give an example of why that doesn't necessarily work. I mean, my favorite sports league, the NBA, the National Basketball Association is more than 65 percent black. And I don't think any serious person would believe that that's because white jocks just don't get a fair shake in American society. The reason is that there's what you might call a cultural variable. African-Americans play basketball more and so on average, at the median, with all due respect to the hit from French Lick, we're better at it. White guys play more baseball, and if you look at MLB that is a very heavily Caucasian and Hispanic athletically. And you see this same thing in more what you might call serious situations all the time. So in 1995, the government economist June O'Neill, who is a liberal as I understand, and the conservative researcher, Dinesh D'Souza, who was fairly nonpartisan at the time, looked at the troubling fact that there was a gap between black and white incomes. As I recall, African-Americans made 82 percent of what Caucasians did. And this was just universally attributed to racism. And what they found out was that that wasn't the case. There were a lot of quote-unquote, variables involved. African-Americans are a younger population. The most common age for a black man is 27. The most common age for a white man is 58. Obviously, people earn more later in life when they've had the chance to move into executive roles. African-Americans are much more concentrated in the south where wages are lower for everyone. If you adjust for these factors and just a couple of others, I mean years not even quality of schooling, just staying in school. Average performance on a test like the SAT, the gap almost disappeared. And you could argue that some of those things are tied into class and whatnot. But there's no pattern of businesses paying an absolutely equally qualified black guy and an absolutely equally qualified white guy different amounts in general. And I think that's a valuable lesson to take into life. So, when people argue that policing is institutionally racist, almost always what they are saying is, African-Americans are arrested at a higher rate or they encounter police at a higher rate than the black percentage of society would predict. But the obvious intermediary variable there is crime rate. If you look at the Bureau of Justice Statistics crime report, the African-American crime rate for violent crimes where you encounter the police, whites dominate corporate crime is 2.4 times the white rate. So, you would expect there unfortunately, to be more encounters between African-Americans and the police. And when you look at this narrative about black people and the police being in constant conflict, not only does a lot of the structural element -- perhaps not all of it, but a great deal -- disappear if you adjust for crime rate. The figures themselves that are often used strike me as very, very inflated in terms of police violence. So there's a comprehensive database of police shootings and police killings maintained by \"The Washington Post\" newspaper. There's another one that's kept online and live at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.killedbypolice.net&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=4F-S_-1PlnteXeB2D7EabvoXExN6ADkRjgGdobPawxE&s=X3oKXzMCTXBTXlVrvKD9yAHblRaQvKEa71V2tJSrIzM&e= . And if you look at that \"Washington Post\" database, for some reason, the figures change from time to time. But until about a week ago, the total number of unarmed men killed by police in the USA last year was listed as nine, unarmed black individuals. Total number of unarmed people, all races, all sexes, was only 56. There were only about a thousand people of all backgrounds armed or unarmed killed by police, and only 229 of those were African-American. And there's a lot of serious research that looks at types of violence other than just shooting, other than killing. So, Roland Fryer, who is one of the youngest individuals ever to gain tenure at Harvard, and like me, as a black man took a comprehensive look at every type of police violence in a paper that came out in, I believe 2016. And what he found is that there were some small gaps. African-Americans were a bit more likely to be, for example, cursed at or lightly shoved. But when it came to extreme beatings or police shootings, African-Americans, in the case of shootings, were actually 24.2 less likely with everything along with race adjusted for, to be shot by the police than whites were. So, I don't think you see a pattern of broad systemic targeting specifically, of black people by the police today. That doesn't mean there aren't individual bad officers. I mean, we saw the horrifying George Floyd tape. I mean, my position is that charges should be filed against every one of the officers involved in that situation. But even there, the facts are a little more complex than they originally seemed to be. Two of the officers on the scene as it turns out, Thao and Kueng, if I have the names correct, are not Caucasian men. Floyd and Chauvin, the officer primarily responsible for the killing had previously known one another from a nightlife security position. So, I don't think we can just look at interactions between African- Americans and the police and say, what we have here is an epidemic pattern of racism, a genocide as Attorney Crump called it in the recent book. LEVIN: All right. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEVIN: Welcome back. Professor Reilly, well based on what you're saying, based on what I'm reading, based on the data, really, police brutality is not the issue that is holding back people in these various communities. What is holding back people in these various communities? And why is the narrative so heavily focused on police brutality? REILLY: Well, I think that's a very complex question that gets into a lot of things like the difference between historic and contemporary racism. So first of all, one thing that I would say is that minority communities in the United States have gone through and come through a lot. The black community endured slavery, at least in the south, endured Jim Crow. The crack era and so on down the line. And you've actually seen some pretty steady closures of gaps between blacks and whites. Just looking at this casually doing some research the other day, I mean, the black SAT rose from about 1,800 as I recall in the 1970s to 950 looking at College Board data just a couple of years ago. So, the black story in America is not a story of tragedy. But when you look at things that are genuinely problematic in a large scale in the black community, I think you're seeing legacies of racism in the past. You're looking at poverty housing and so on down the line, and even more to the point to me, you're seeing legacies of the 1960s welfare state. Fatherlessness, for example, is the biggest problem. I'm just going to blame black people here -- the biggest problem among all groups in America. The great economist Walter Williams in 1938 looked at rates of fatherlessness for whites as I recall, that was under four percent, for African-Americans, it was 11 percent. Those same rates today are 35.4 percent for Caucasians, including Caucasian-Hispanics, over 50 percent, close to 60 percent for Hispanics and Native Americans, 72 percent for African-Americans. And obviously the presence of a father in particularly a young man's life is one of the biggest predictors of how well he is going to do in High School, how likely he is to go to jail. Things like suicide. That's especially true by the way for lower income Caucasian Americans. So, I think there are very broad systemic problems in the black community and in many American communities, I would say the collapse of the family and the things associated with this small business community social sector, probably the biggest one. Why is it so tempting to blame the ghosts of the past? I think, to some extent, two reasons. One, we're used to doing so. And two, there is broad social approval. So I mean, celebrities, LeBron James, for example, know that if they say the cause of every one of these problems, such as fatherlessness, or the test score gap is racism. One, that is going to be greeted very approvingly by a network of natural allies throughout society. And two, it will sound like something that most people are used to hearing. But dealing with the actual problems in African-American communities and other communities is going to take more than the eradication of racism. And it's worth noting, by the way that the large majority of people, black and white are not racist in any conventional sense today. We might look at the results on some complex implicit bias test and be a little worried for a bit, but if you look at actual classic questions, would you vote for a qualified member of the other race for President if they ran with your political party? The figure for that is 92 percent for African-Americans and for whites. Well over 80 percent of people support interracial dating, marriage love. So, I don't think we can simply look at an issue like violence in cities and say, well, that's due to racism. One thing you have to point out is that many of the large cities in the United States of America have been controlled by Democratic, often minority led administrations for decades. So, if there is a problem with the schools in Detroit or with gun violence in the streets, you can't necessarily just say, well, that's the white man. LEVIN: And also on this interracial issue you raised, I looked at statistics based on a few years back, and it indicated that new marriages, 17 percent or almost one in five are interracial. Now, how can you have systemic racism, when one out of every five marriage is interracial -- and the other statistics you provided? See, I could be wrong about this. And I'd like to pose this to you for the next segment. This notion of systemic racism means everything and means nothing. It's an excuse for not addressing the real issues that exist in these communities and other communities. You pointed out one party rule, one party ideology, one party economic ideology. So, there's a battle. There are obstacles to things like school choice that exist in other parts of the country, but not in the inner cities. You have the Democratic Party that oppose this and as I said earlier in the show, Barack Obama led the battle against the school choice in many of these communities. And so, if you're going to have truly revolutionary and radical ideas, you have to have competition politically, competition in schools and opportunities. I'd like your thought on that when we return. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEVIN: Professor Reilley, how about a liberty agenda? A competition agenda? The sort of environment that exists in so many other parts of the country. It's never discussed. You never hear it discussed by people in the media or in Hollywood, and so forth. How about a real liberty agenda? REILLY: If you're talking about for the black community, I would fully support that. One thing I will say is that I think that more competition economically and politically would be an excellent thing for the African- American community. I would love to see the black community split our vote 50/50 because that would imply that both political parties might actually do something for us. What you see right now is that every four years, with a few exceptions, there are a few long term serving black civil servants, but Democratic politicians come out of the woodwork during election years and make impassioned, racialized pitches to the black community, and this is true no matter who the G.O.P. candidate is. I mean, when Mitt Romney who is a centrist anti-racist Republican was running for President, Joe Biden's comment about him was he is going to put you all back in chains. Mitt Romney is not going to bring back slavery, no matter which political party you vote for. He's just not going to. And this year, the exact same line has been used against Donald Trump. In Political Science, by the way, we find that the mainstream media covered most G.O.P. Presidents as they've covered Donald Trump. The reaction to him isn't a result of his sometimes over the top offensive language, it is also how Romney was discussed, it is how Bush was discussed. But in regard to Trump, Joe Biden said, \"You ain't black\" to the radio host Charlemagne tha God if you would consider voting for Donald while he's in office. So, I don't think that sort of virtue signaling every four years does much. Again, obviously racism is real, but today, simply put, the biggest predictor of how successful you become in this country is not residual prejudice around you. The most successful groups in the country have a competition or a liberty agenda. Nigerian-Americans, Japanese-Americans, East Indian-Americans, Lebanese-Americans, these, not white or black Americans are the wealthiest Americans. And I would definitely like to see a lot of that agenda transitioned into deprived communities, whether poor white communities or African-American communities, although clearly my focus is on African-American communities. I'd like to see enterprise zones. I'd like to see charter schools as an option for striving minority parents. HBCUs, a good number of which are private -- I'm proud to teach at one -- do a fair amount of good in this arena, but that's after high school. But yes, I would like to see as many chances to competitively perform in the hood as there are to competitively perform in the suburbs, and that would do much, much more good for poor people, especially poor black people than the endless ghost hunting for new, more refined forms of racism. LEVIN: But you do understand what that means. That means trying to figure out how to defeat one party rule in these cities and how to defeat the teachers unions in these cities, and a whole bureaucracy and a whole a group of surrogates that have grown out of these -- these one party rule cities. That that's going to be very difficult. REILLY: Yes, just very quickly. Public sector unions in general, to me, as a businessman and an academic are problematic. Private sector unions are great. With public sector unions, you don't really have two parties coming to the table. You have the union made up of middle class employees and executives in the public sector and then you have the politicians to whom these unions give sizable donations. Those are the two parties negotiating and those are not two distinct parties. By the way, in terms of real solutions to the issues of policing, a lot of those would involve tackling police unions. You sometimes hear that Camden got rid of the police. No, they didn't. What they did was break the police union, give cops some basic training in related fields like social work and change their name, but they have 70 percent more boots on the ground in terms of what in practice police officers than they used to. So, the more you can take on these public sector unions to achieve things like actual body cameras in every department, a discussion about no knock raids, removing these various complex forms of immunity from contracts, perhaps I'd like to hear officers reactions to that, the better you'll see -- the better a relationship between police and the communities they serve, you will see. LEVIN: All right, Professor. I want to thank you very, very much. You've been extremely edifying. And God bless you. REILLY: You as well. LEVIN: We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEVIN: Welcome back. You know, America is a great country with great people. Massive diversity, where the vast majority of us get along, but there are forces in this country, political, and others that seek the divide us. This idea that America is systemically racist is a big lie. The purpose of the flag and the National Anthem is to unite the country. The people who attack it, don't seek to unite the country. Let's go through history very quickly in the minutes that I have left. We had a Civil War that began in 1861. Over 800,000 casualties. That would be the equivalent today of over eight million casualties. And over half of those were soldiers and others fighting for the North, to keep the union together and to end slavery. No nation on the face of the Earth has ever undertaken such an effort. In 1863, we have the Emancipation Proclamation. President Lincoln freeing the slaves throughout the country, particularly the south. We had 1865, the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. The states ratified the 13th Amendment. We had the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1871. The Enforcement Act of 1870. The Force Act of 1871 -- all intended to advance the cause of integration. With the KKK Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. In 1868, the 14th Amendment was ratified by the states. It abolishes, not only did it abolish slavery, it guarantees due process and equal protection of all citizens, especially freed African slaves. In 1870, the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote for all citizens. Now, the implementation of this became problematic because of the Democratic Party and racist elements, not just in the south and in the north that didn't believe in reconstruction after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and after Ulysses S. Grant left office, and so there have been many efforts since then, including by our courts, our national legislatures and our state legislature. You have in 1954, the Brown versus Board of Education decision, nine to zero, reversing parts of Plessy versus Ferguson. It ended legal racial segregation in schools. In 1962, Bailey versus Patterson ends desegregation and transportation. In the 1964 Civil Rights Act passed by the overwhelming majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate and majorities of the Democrats in both prohibits discrimination in voting, public accommodations, public facilities, public education, Federal assistance programs and employment and established the EEOC or the 1965 Voting Rights Act that prohibited denial or restriction of the right to vote. It forbids discriminatory voting practices nationwide. In 1967, you had the Loving versus Virginia Act declaring state laws prohibiting interracial marriage to be unconstitutional. Going back, in 1953, Dwight Eisenhower instituted rules that eliminated discrimination in government contracting. He desegregated Federal government in the nation's capital. In 1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1957, it created the Civil Rights Commission. It created the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. In 1957 and 1959, Eisenhower ordered desegregation of the Washington, D.C. public schools. We have the Insurrection Act that was amended in 1871 to allow the use of military to enforce among other things, Civil Rights and desegregation. In 1871, Ulysses S. Grant sent a thousand soldiers to hunt down Klansmen in South Carolina and they captured 600 of them. In 1957, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to protect nine black students entering Little Rock Central High School against the order of the Governor at the time, Orville Faubus, one of Bill Clinton's mentors, by the way. In 1962, John Kennedy federalized the National Guard to allow a black student to enroll in classes at the University of Mississippi-Oxford. In 1965, LBJ federalized the National Guard to protect Civil Rights marches headed for Selma to Montgomery. This -- I'm just touching the tip of the iceberg. The number of economic programs, the trillions of dollars and so forth, don't tell me this country is systemically racist. If this country were systemically racist, none of this would have taken place. None of this would be taking place. We, Americans are good people, regardless of our race, regardless of our religion, regardless of our sex, regardless of the politicians who try to divide us, the media who try to divide us, these so-called cultural icons who try to divide us. We're an imperfect people in an imperfect country, but it is the greatest country in the face of the Earth. Just ask most of those who are on TV who are in sports or in Hollywood, who trash it day in and day out. If you want real revolutionary, dramatic reforms, including in our inner cities, then abandon the old economic practices, allow choice, allow liberty to take place in these communities. They're ruled by one party -- iron fisted control. And the politicians that run these towns, as far as I'm concerned are corrupt right up to here.

            "article_content": "Lawrence Jones reacts to Joe Biden naming Kamala Harris as his 2020 running mate Kamala Harris, the politically shrewd California senator with a law enforcement background that has caused some tensions with the progressive left, was announced Tuesday as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. \"I\u2019ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,\" Biden said in an email to supporters. She makes history as the first Black woman to serve as a major political party\u2019s VP pick. \"I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief,\" Harris tweeted. The Biden campaign said\u00a0Biden and Harris will deliver remarks together on Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden tweeted on Tuesday,\u00a0\"Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this\u00a0campaign.\" The decision, following months of secret meetings and closely held deliberations, would indicate the former vice president is setting aside their friction from the primary campaign. Harris memorably drew sharp contrasts with Biden when she challenged him on the debate stage over his past resistance to federally mandated desegregation busing. 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SEN. KAMALA HARRIS Signaling the campaign's line of attack against Harris, President Trump responded by tweeting out an attack ad soon after the announcement that called\u00a0her \u201cphony Kamala Harris.\u201d The Trump campaign also released a statement from\u00a0Katrina Pierson, a Trump 2020 senior adviser, that said:\u00a0\"In her failed attempt at running for president, Kamala Harris gleefully embraced the left\u2019s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders\u2019 government takeover of health care. She is proof that Joe Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left.\u201d The now-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s selection amounts to a vote of confidence in the senator\u2019s political ability and her background, and a willingness to move past the bad blood. The decision may have been tipped days earlier, when he was photographed with talking points saying of Harris that he does \u201cnot hold grudges\u201d and has \u201cgreat respect for her.\u201d The choice also fulfills a commitment the former vice president made in March to name a woman as running mate. Naming a Black woman at a time when issues of racial inequality are front-and-center also responds to signals from some circles in the party that such a choice could help build bridges with the Black community. The timing gives Biden space to re-introduce her to voters ahead of this month\u2019s scaled-back Democratic National Convention. Former President Obama praised the pick. \"Joe Biden nailed this decision,\" Obama said in a statement. \"By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as America\u2019s next vice president, he\u2019s underscored his own judgment and character.\" Biden\u2019s naming of 55-year-old Harris as his running mate comes 13 months after she flattened him on the debate stage in Miami at the first Democratic presidential primary showdown. During the debate, Harris criticized comments by the former vice president spotlighting his ability to find common ground during the 1970s with segregationist senators with whom he disagreed, and his opposition decades ago to federally mandated school busing. \u201cDo you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America?\u201d Harris asked Biden during the debate. HARRIS TAKES DOWN BIDEN AT FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE And in a line that went viral, she spotlighted that \u201cthere was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.\u201d Biden, who served eight\u00a0years as vice president to Barack Obama, the first Black president in U.S. history, and who\u2019s enjoyed strong support from African-American voters as he makes his third bid for president, angrily said the senator\u2019s comments were \u201ca mischaracterization\u201d of his position. Biden\u2019s poll numbers briefly edged down after the debate \u2013 and Harris enjoyed a short-lived surge in the polls. But her campaign faltered later in the year, and Harris ended her White House bid last December. By the time she suspended her campaign, the relationship between Harris and Biden had improved. Biden has publicly praised Harris numerous times \u2013\u00a0and has repeatedly pointed out that he\u2019s thought highly of her since she became close to his late son, Beau Biden, when they both served as attorney\u00a0general\u00a0of their respective states. Harris ended up endorsing Biden and appeared on stage with him \u2013 along with another former rival, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2013 at a rally in Michigan on the eve of that state\u2019s March 10 primary, which the former vice president ended up winning decisively as he moved closer to locking up the Democratic nomination. \u201cI believe in Joe. I believe in Joe,\u201d Harris said at the rally. \u201cI know Joe. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m supporting him.\u201d The rally was Biden\u2019s last before the coronavirus pandemic swept across the country, shutting down in-person campaigning. Since then, Harris has campaigned virtually for Biden, headlining online events and fundraisers. While the Harris-Biden feud now seems like ancient history, what may still be relevant is her prosecutorial record as San Francisco district attorney and later as California attorney general. Even before she announced her White House bid in January of last year, Harris\u2019 record as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d was being scrutinized and criticized by some on the left. And that record was in the spotlight at last summer\u2019s second Democratic primary debate in Detroit, as the senator faced withering attacks from Biden and another rival, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. The former vice president accused Harris of keeping nonviolent prisoners behind bars during her tenure as California attorney general because they were a source of cheap labor for the state. \u201cWhat happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough is enough and he freed 1,000 of these people,\u201d Biden said as he argued that Harris was forced by a judge to release the prisoners. Gabbard also jumped in to land heavy blows \u2013 accusing Harris of keeping \u201cpeople in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.\u201d While the intra-party rifts from 2019 appear to have healed long ago, the attacks from past primary debates could be used as ammunition by President\u00a0Trump\u2019s campaign and allied groups to target Biden and Harris. And it remains unclear whether the progressive flank of the party will embrace her. Harris, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, grabbed plenty of attention two years later for her grilling of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings. Harris was a co-sponsor last year of The Green New Deal. As a presidential candidate, she announced her support for the federal legalization of marijuana. The senator was an original co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d bill, which if enacted would essentially eliminate private insurance. But she moderated her stance during her nearly year-long White House bid. Harris took a political hit last summer when she introduced a health care plan that allowed for private insurance to co-exist with a government run system. The senator\u2019s called for a national moratorium on the death penalty. And on gun violence, Harris has proposed a ban on importing AR-15-style assault weapons and supported a national buyback program for such weapons. She also said on the campaign trail that if elected president, she would sign executive orders requiring enhanced background checks for weapons purchases if Congress failed to act. Choosing a running mate is arguably the most consequential decision a presidential candidate can make. Biden announced in March during a one-on-one Democratic primary debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders that if he won the nomination, he\u2019d name a woman as his running mate. And the former vice president emphasized for months that he needed to choose a running mate who\u2019s \u201csimpatico with where I am,\u201d pointing to his own strong relationship with former President Obama during their eight years together steering the country. Starting in late May, after the outbreak of protests in cities nationwide over systemic racism sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while in police custody, the volume was turned up on calls for Biden to name a Black woman as the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Biden told reporters during a rare news conference at the beginning of July that he had prepared a list of \u201cwomen of color\u201d for consideration \u2013 but he wouldn\u2019t announce a decision until August. Three weeks later he acknowledged that of those he was considering for this running mate, \u201camong them there are four Black women.\u201d The former vice president made his comments during an MSNBC interview. Among the other Black candidates Biden was thought to be considering were\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Val Demings of Florida, who is a former Orlando police\u00a0chief;\u00a0Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms;\u00a0former Georgia House leader and 2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams;\u00a0former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President Obama Susan Rice;\u00a0and Rep. Karen Bass\u00a0of California. Biden was also thought to be considering progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0of Massachusetts, who was a Biden rival during the Democratic nomination race;\u00a0Tammy Baldwin\u00a0of Wisconsin;\u00a0and Tammy Duckworth\u00a0of Illinois, the first Thai-born woman elected to Congress and an Iraq war veteran who lost both of her legs piloting helicopters in combat. Also believed to be on his list were Govs. Gretchen Whitmer\u00a0of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham\u00a0of New Mexico. Many of the other contenders congratulated Harris on Twitter after the announcement was made. Biden\u2019s naming of his running mate came just several days before the Democratic National Convention\u00a0is scheduled to kick off\u00a0on Aug. 17. Then-Sen. Barack Obama named Biden as his running mate just three days before the 2008 Democratic convention. And Donald Trump named then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the 2016 Republican convention.",

Dozens of Cornell University faculty, staff, students, and alumni signed onto a letter attacking \"colorblind\" practices,\u00a0insisting that the university institute racial quotas and recruit \"clusters\" of non-White individuals. The letter, published Monday, launches into a long list of immediate and long-term demands after accusing the Ivy League university of \"symbolic\" efforts in response to racism. \"As an institution Cornell aspires to the highest principles of civic duty,\" the letter reads.\u00a0\"Yet every 'colorblind'\u00a0event, mechanism, and process at the university \u2014 from new faculty orientations to selection of endowed positions \u2014 perpetuates racial disparities and reinforces an unjust status quo.\" To remedy that, the letter proposes setting benchmarks for the proportion of trustees and faculty of color. \"Increase representation of Black faculty to 7 percent in 2025 and to 10 percent in 2030,\" the demand reads. \"Increase representation of other faculty of color to 20 percent in 2025 and 25 percent in 2030, in line with the percentage of new PhDs conferred in the US. Create benchmarks for increasing BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and People of Color]\u00a0faculty in those departments and disciplines with the most severe underrepresentation.\" COLLEGE BACKTRACKS AFTER DESIGNATING SEPARATE DISCUSSION GROUPS FOR WHITE STUDENTS AND 'PEOPLE OF COLOR' In the short-term, that entails recruiting \"clusters\" of faculty and students who are Black, indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). The demands\u00a0explicitly call\u00a0for an end to \"colorblind recruitment polices and practices in partner/spousal hiring,\" as well as \"partner/spousal hires to all BIPOC faculty, including assistant professors.\" Tao Leigh Goffe, an assistant professor at Cornell and the letter's\u00a0first signatory, tweeted about the demands. At the undergraduate level, the signatories want the university to stop considering SAT/ACT scores \"and acknowledge the role of standardized testing in exacerbating race/class disparities, especially given the racialized history of intelligence testing. The Ithaca, N.Y.-based university did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. As the letter notes, University President Martha Pollack recently announced plans for the creation of a center focused on researching issues related to systemic racism. JESSICA KRUG, THE GW UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR WHO PRETENDED TO BE BLACK, HAS RESIGNED Cornell's curriculum must also undergo \"systematic\u00a0changes,\" the letter argues. It's unclear what exactly \"anti-racist pedagogies\" would involve, but the term \"anti-racist\" appeared\u00a0to surface\u00a0more frequently\u00a0in the wake of protests surrounding the May 25 death of George Floyd. Dr. Ibram Kendi, who leads Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research, wrote a book that has been recommended by Amazon and others as the nation confronts racial unrest. In \"How to Be an Anti-Racist,\" Kendi\u00a0writes that \"there is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy. Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups.\" He then touts\u00a0discrimination as a tool for creating racial equality. \"The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity,\" he writes.\u00a0\"If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. ... The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Monday's letter came as the Trump administration denounced \"critical race theory\" as \"anti-American propaganda.\" The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo Friday banning trainings that involved, for example, White employees acknowledging they benefited from racism. \"The divisive, false, and demeaning propaganda of the critical race theory movement is contrary to all we stand for as Americans and should have no place in the Federal government,\" OMB Director Russ Vought argued.",

Former civil rights activist Bob Woodson issued a sweeping indictment Tuesday of both the Black Lives Matter movement and the idea that\u00a0\"systemic racism\" is the cause of African-American hardship in the U.S. \"I don't know what systemic\u00a0racism is.\u00a0Maybe someone can\u00a0explain what that means,\" he told \"Tucker Carlson\u00a0Tonight.\" Carlson responded by asserting that it was \"a way to make\u00a0people be quiet and stop asking\u00a0questions about economics, as far\u00a0as I can tell.\" Woodson's\u00a0interview came as protesters across America marched for another night to protest police brutality against George Floyd and other\u00a0African Americans -- something many have described as a result of systemic or institutional racism. Earlier in his interview, Woodson, a former head of the National Urban League Department of Criminal Justice, told Carlson that the civil rights movement promised that if black people led institutions, \"all of black America would be better off.\" OWNER OF HISTORIC VIRGINIA JEWELRY STORE PRAISES 'OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT' AFTER BUSINESS WAS LOOTED Woodson\u00a0told Carlson that he left the movement because he \"realized that many of the people who suffered most -- poor blacks -- do\u00a0not benefit from the change -- that they're demographics were used by some of those leaders.\" \"It's more class than it is race ... and now race\u00a0is being used to deflect\u00a0attention away from the failures\u00a0of people running those\u00a0institutions,\" he added. \"The question is why are\u00a0black\u00a0kids failing in school systems\u00a0run by their own people?\" \"When Eric Holder was a U.S.\u00a0Attorney in Washington, D.C., a\u00a0lot of young people were shot by the\u00a0police, but they were black\u00a0police shooting black kids and\u00a0not one was prosecuted.\u00a0But there was no public outcry\u00a0because as long as illegality or evil\u00a0wears a black face, then it\u00a0escapes detection and that's what's wrong\u00a0with looking life\u00a0through the prism of race.\" Woodson also suggested that much of black suffering was the result of Democratic leadership. \"In the past 50 years,\u00a0$22 trillion has been spent on poverty programs. Seventy\u00a0percent goes not to the\u00a0poor but those who serve poor people,\" he said. BLACK FIREFIGHTER 'DEVASTATED' AFTER RIOTERS DESTROY BAR HE SPENT LIFE SAVINGS TO BUILD \"So many of those people\u00a0taking office use this money to\u00a0create a class of people who are\u00a0running these cities, and now\u00a0after 50 years of liberal\u00a0Democrats running the inner\u00a0cities, where we have all of\u00a0these inequities that we have,\u00a0race\u00a0is being used as a ruse, as a means of\u00a0deflecting attention away from\u00a0critical questions such as why are poor blacks failing in systems run by their own people?\" On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by\u00a0Woodson who argued that hostility towards the police has hurt black people.

Also, you have sketchy authentication systems, including signature machines that were set at lower levels of discrimination in confirming signatures or changes in state laws that say if the signature doesn't match it doesn't matter,\" Turley said. \"All of those things exist in a variety of states, not just Nevada.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nevada Republicans made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice claiming more than 3,000 voters are identified as possibly ineligible. However, Turley said it may be \"impossible\" for a court to review specific votes because of the way Nevada has preserved its records. \"What does a court do if thousands of votes of ineligible voters may have been counted? That may be where we're heading and it's not just a problem in Nevada,\" he said as Trump and Joe Biden still have Pennsylvania, Georgia\u00a0and North Carolina up for grabs in a tightly contested race.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A growing number of America's Black youth are questioning longstanding loyalties to the Democratic Party. It's a stance that reflects a broader\u00a0willingness to scrutinize the status quo among members of\u00a0Gen Z, the segment of the U.S. population born from the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s that's quickly becoming a generation of activists. Its members have joined\u00a0nationwide demonstrations\u00a0over racial injustice, the debilitating economic and public health fallout from the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0and the 2020 presidential election. Among other things, they're asking why conditions in communities led by Democratic officials aren't improving, according to a\u00a0report in Politico. That question, admittedly, sets them apart from the mainstream of Gen Z, reportedly more liberal than any previous group. TRUMP TRAVELING TO PENNSYLVANIA AMID RETURN TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL Black voters have largely been responsible for the success of former vice president Joe Biden's campaign, and most Black Americans overwhelmingly support Democrats, casting more than 90%\u00a0of their votes for the party's candidates in the past three presidential elections. It's a pattern deeply rooted in the latter phase of the\u00a0civil rights movement. Still, a\u00a02019 study from the Pew Research Center concluded that while liberals make up a majority of the Democratic voting bloc, 43% of Black voters said they identified as moderate and 25% identified as conservative. TRUMP COULD HAVE OPENING WITH BLACK, LATINO MEN AS BIDEN UNDERPERFORMS IN POLLS, REPORT SAYS Young voters like\u00a018-year-old conservative activist Coreco Ja\u2019Quan \"C.J.\" Pearson -- a freshman at the\u00a0University of Alabama and a surrogate for the Trump reelection campaign -- assert that their families' values lay the foundation for conservatism. They reportedly see President Trump as one of the few leaders to deliver results on issues impacting the Black community and argue that Democratic policies have long been detrimental to their neighborhoods. Online activists such as Pearson often encourage undecided and prospective voters to consider other options than Democrats\u00a0rather than promote the president's administration itself. The Black Conservative Movement, a 200,000-strong online group\u00a0 dedicated to young Black Republican voters, has propelled a similar narrative under the label of \"free thinking.\" Ashley Nealy of Atlanta waits in a line to vote early at the State Farm Arena on Monday, Oct. 12, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) They say that if Black voters ignored the political pressure from party leaders, they would be able to clearly see the negative impacts of previous legislation. For example, Congress'\u00a01994 Crime Bill is being scrutinized anew by Gen Zers across the country. Many feel the bill, which Biden co-authored, disproportionately affects Black communities --\u00a0even though the ban on assault weapons was popular among Black lawmakers almost 30 years ago. Young Black conservatives say their support for Trump is based on policies that work for them:\u00a0the First Step Act,\u00a0 the FUTURE Act\u00a0and economic success leading to historically low\u00a0Black unemployment numbers. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Their canvassing may pay off. As Politico noted, even a small dip in\u00a0Black support for the Democratic nominee in states with\u00a0substantial Black populations could mean victory for the president in November. Conversely, Black Democrats continue to present themselves as a party for racial justice: ending disparities in prison sentencing, strengthening anti-discrimination laws, expanding Black business opportunities\u00a0and enforcing voting rights.

            "article_content": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream breaks down the ruling on 'America's Newsroom.' The Supreme Court handed a big win to the LGBT community Monday, ruling in a 6-3 decision that an employer who fires a worker for being gay or transgender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act --\u00a0which already protected people from employer sex discrimination, as well as discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin. The decision dealt with three cases. In one, Clayton County, Georgia employee Gerald Bostock was fired from his job as a child welfare advocate for conduct \u201cunbecoming\u201d a county employee soon after he joined a gay softball league. In another, New York\u00a0skydiving instructor Donald Zarda\u00a0was fired days after mentioning he was gay, and in a third, Michigan funeral home worker Aimee Stephens was fired after she told her employer that she would be identifying as a woman six years into her employment. ROBERTS EMBRACES ROLE AS SUPREME COURT SWING JUSTICE, WITH LATEST CHURCH RULING \"Ours is a society of written laws. Judges are not free to overlook plain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations. In Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee\u2019s sex when deciding to fire that employee,\" said the court's opinion, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.\" In all three situations, the employers admitted that they fired the workers for being gay or transgender, but they argued that this did not violate Title VII. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard Bostock\u2019s case, agreed with this view. The Second and Sixth Circuits, which heard Zarda\u2019s and Stephens\u2019 cases, respectively, ruled differently. Zarda and Stephens both died while their cases moved forward, but their estates continued on behalf of their heirs. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS OBAMA APPOINTMENT OF OVERSIGHT BOARD DEALING WITH PUERTO RICO'S FINANCIAL CRISIS The court justified their inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity under Title VII by focusing on the law\u2019s language, which prohibits discrimination \u201cbecause of\u201d sex, stating that as long as sex is a factor the discrimination, that is enough to trigger Title VII. The majority goes on to use a hypothetical where an employer has two workers who are attracted to men, but one is a man and the other is a woman, stating that firing the man for being gay would be discriminating against him because of his sex because he has the same preference as the female employee. The court similarly discussed a potential situation where two workers identified as female but one was identified as male at birth and the other female. \"[T]he individual employee\u2019s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision,\" the court said about such situations. Justice Samuel Alito said the majority went too far, calling the decision \"legislation,\"\u00a0in a dissent joined by Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas. \"There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation. The document that the Court releases is in the form of a judicial opinion interpreting a statute, but that is deceptive,\" Alito wrote. Alito noted that the majority opinion \"no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses,\" acknowledging the desire to treat gay, lesbian, and transgender people \"with the dignity, consideration, and fairness that everyone deserves,\" but said the court's role \"is limited to saying what the law is,\" not adding to it. Justice Brett Kavanaugh made a similar argument in\u00a0a dissent of his own. \"Under the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, the responsibility to amend Title VII belongs to Congress and the President in the legislative process, not to this Court,\" he wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At the same time, Kavanaugh recognized the significance of the court's ruling for LGBT rights. \"Notwithstanding my concern about the Court\u2019s transgression of the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, it is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\u00a0\"Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity, and grit\u2014battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today\u2019s result.\"",

The bronze statue that has stood at the museum\u2019s Central Park West entrance since 1940, as the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported, depicted Roosevelt on horseback with a Native American man and an African man standing next to the horse. \u201cThe American Museum of Natural History has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior,\u201d\u00a0de Blasio announced Sunday in a written statement. \u201cIt is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.\u201d In 2017, protesters splashed red liquid, representing blood, on the statue\u2019s base and published a statement calling for its removal as an emblem of \u201cpatriarchy, white supremacy and settler-colonialism.\u201d \u201cOver the last few weeks, our museum community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd,\u201d the museum\u2019s president, Ellen Futter, told the Times. \u201cWe have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism,\u201d she added. \u201cSimply put, the time has come to move it.\u201d A prominent statue of Theodore Roosevelt will be removed from the entrance of The American Museum of Natural History in New York City, officials announced.

John Lewis, D-Ga., they should pass and sign a bill restoring the Voting Rights Act. \u201cI think Trump and the Senate leadership, Mitch McConnell ... if they so celebrate the heroism of this man, then let's go to work and pass that bill,\u201d Clyburn said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d in reference to a bill the House passed in December that would restore the Voting Rights Act. Lewis, a civil rights\u2019 movement legend and longtime congressman, died last week at the age of 80 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. TRIBUTES POUR IN FOR CIVIL RIGHTS ICON AND US REP. JOHN LEWIS: 'WE HAVE LOST A GIANT' Following his death, condolences poured in from both sides of the political divide for a man whose bloody beating by Alabama state troopers in 1965 helped galvanize opposition to racial segregation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Lewis was \u201ca pioneering civil rights leader who put his life on the line to fight racism, promote equal rights\u00a0and bring our nation into greater alignment with its founding principles.\u201d \u201cHe loved this country so much that he risked his life and its blood so that it might live up to its promise,\u201d President Barack Obama said after Lewis' death. \u201cEarly on, he embraced the principles of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience as the means to bring about real change in this country.\u201d RICHARD FOWLER: REP. JOHN LEWIS HEROICALLY FOUGHT RACISM AND CHANGED AMERICA \u2013 HIS DEATH IS A LOSS FOR US ALL Clyburn argued on Sunday that the bill the House passed in December is laid out the way the Supreme Court \u201casked us to\u201d in its 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision that invalidated a key portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \u201cIf the president were to sign that, then I think that's what we will do to honor John,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. That's the way to do it. Words may be powerful, but deeds are lasting.\u201d If signed into law, the bill would amend the 1965 law to impose new obligations on states and local jurisdictions, essentially reversing a 2013 Supreme Court decision that tossed out a \u201cpre-clearance\u201d provision that determined which jurisdictions needed federal oversight of elections. REP. JOHN LEWIS: TIMELINE OF EVENTS IN A REMARKABLE LIFE The bill was approved, 228-187, with just one Republican, Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, joing Democrats in voting to approve the legislation. Lewis announced the tally in a sign of the importance Democratic leaders placed on the measure. Strict voter registration requirements, polling place confusion and other obstacles faced by Georgia voters in 2018 show why federal oversight of elections is still needed in places with a history of discrimination, supporters said. Problems also were reported in Florida, where elections officials came under withering criticism for their handling of a legally required recount in close races for governor and U.S. Senate. The White House, however, opposes the bill, calling it an example of federal overreach. The Democratic-backed measure would give the federal government \u201ctoo much authority over an even greater number of voting practices and decisions made by states and local governments without justifying the current needs for such policies,\u2033 the White House said in a statement.

AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 A lawsuit about whether coronavirus face masks can be required at polling places in Texas on Election Day was partially revived Wednesday evening by the\u00a0U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, according to local reports. The original lawsuit aimed for a court order that would require masks, add more voting locations and machines, and tack on an extra week of early voting as precautions amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the Austin-American Statesman reported. Only the mask issue was sent back down to a lower court, Statesman reporter Chuck Lindell tweeted Wednesday evening. TEXAS REPUBLICANS CHALLENGE CURBSIDE, DRIVE-THRU VOTING IN NEW LAWSUIT A three-judge panel ruled that the other parts of the case were rightfully dismissed by the lower court, but sent the mask issue back for further proceedings. \u201cThe changes sought by the Plaintiffs by and large would up-end the process,\u201d since early voting has already begun, the panel wrote \u2013 but judges saw \u201ca possible exception\u201d in that argument for the mask-wearing requirement under the Voting Rights Act and returned that part to the lower court for review. At issue is a portion of one of Texas\u2019 statewide mask orders that requires them in public places, but exempts poll workers and voters. The plaintiffs argued that Black and Latino communities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that as a result, not requiring masks at polling places \u201cindividually and cumulatively, operate(s) to deny voters the right to vote in a safe, free, fair, and accessible election\u201d in violation of Section Two of the Voting Rights Act.

            "article_content": " Millions of Americans are fed up with divider-in-chief Donald Trump and the awful job he\u2019s done dealing with the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 113,000 Americans and protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police \u2013 among his many failures. As a result, President Trump\u2019s poll ratings are sinking and the prospects are increasing that former Vice President Joe Biden will send Trump into political retirement in the November election. Trump has appealed only to his base and sought to fan the flames of division and conflict between Americans. This is one more sign of the incompetent leadership of our reality TV president and it is also an unwise political move. DOUG SCHOEN: WHY TRUMP-BIDEN RACE IS MUCH CLOSER THAN YOU THINK Hillary Clinton received about 3 million more votes than Trump in the 2016 presidential election, but lost in the Electoral College. Trump is taking a huge gamble if he thinks he can be reelected while trailing by millions of popular votes again, because Biden and his team have no doubt learned from Clinton\u2019s mistakes and are focused on doing better in the Electoral College. Trump has in effect changed the name of our country from the United States to the Divided States of America. He has increased our divisions along lines of race, ethnicity, socio-economic status and political views. In the 1976 Academy Award-winning film \u201cNetwork,\u201d the main character \u2013 a TV news anchor \u2013 persuades his viewers around the country to open their windows and shout: \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take this anymore.\u201d Americans aren\u2019t yelling that out their windows today, but with their marches, protests and expressions of opposition to Trump in opinion polls they are effectively conveying that sentiment regarding the Trump presidency. Biden, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is leading Trump in nearly every poll. After following stay-at-home orders in effect earlier in his home state of Delaware to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, he ventured out on Memorial Day to honor our fallen military service members. And unlike Trump \u2013 who ignores guidance from his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and acts as if he is above the law and all rules that apply to others \u2013 Biden has worn a mask to protect those around him and himself from the coronavirus. Biden is getting out more now and appearing frequently in the media to offer the American people a sensible alternative to the chaotic, impulsive, uninformed and disastrous leadership of Trump. The latest opinion polls show Biden with a significant lead over Trump on a national level of around 10 percentage points. And a CNN poll this week gave Biden a staggering 14 percentage point lead over the president. Trump has in effect changed the name of our country from the United States to the Divided States of America. The CNN poll has been criticized by some as an outlier. But several major national polls (CNN, ABC-Washington Post, Monmouth, Quinnipiac and Fox News) show Biden rising by between 3 and 8 percent from the middle of March until now. While the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll did not show Biden gaining ground since March, it gave him a 7-point lead over Trump. In crucial swing states \u2013 including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA shows Biden\u2019s support has increased by as much as 3 percent since March. The horrific murder of George Floyd \u2013 an unarmed black man on the ground in handcuffs and not resisting police \u2013 has galvanized our nation to the mistreatment of African-Americans at the hands of police and to the larger issue of racism and unequal treatment and opportunity for our black population. A cellphone video recorded Floyd\u2019s death as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s desperate cries that he could not breathe. Three other officers stood by as the life was squeezed out of Floyd\u2019s body. Thankfully, all four officers have now been charged with second-degree murder or aiding and abetting second-degree murder. To his credit, Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate Floyd\u2019s murder to see if a federal crime was committed, and has condemned Floyd\u2019s killing. But the president has devoted most of his attention to attacking the minority of protesters who engaged in looting and other illegal activities. And Trump bears responsibility for law enforcement officers forcibly ejecting peaceful protesters from a park in front of the White House so he could walk to a nearby church for a photo-op, posing with a Bible. Biden has expressed far more sympathy for Floyd\u2019s death and for continued discrimination that African-Americans face. He even traveled to personally meet with Floyd\u2019s family members to express his sympathy for their loss. \u201cFor all of you who are hurting so badly, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d Biden said in a video message. \u201cThis nation grieves with you. Take some solace from the fact we all grieve with you.\u201d CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And speaking directly to Floyd\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, Biden said on video: \u201cLittle Gianna, as I said to you when I saw you yesterday, you\u2019re so brave. Daddy\u2019s looking down and he\u2019s so proud of you. I know you have a lot of questions. No child should have to ask questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations \u2013 why? Why is daddy gone? Looking through your eyes we should ask why are the answers so often too cruel and painful.\u201d \u201cNow is the time for racial justice,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cThat is the answer we must give to our children when they ask why. Because when there is justice for George Floyd we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America and then, as you said Gianna, your daddy will have changed the world.\u201d Biden talks about knowing how those who have lost loved ones are feeling, having lost his first wife, daughter and son. He is a real, relatable, kind and loving man who clearly cares about the pain and problems suffered by others. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That\u2019s a stark contrast to Trump, who tweets and tweets and tweets with complaints about being unfairly attacked, viciously attacks and insults his critics, and labels any news report that doesn\u2019t shower him with praise as \u201cfake news.\u201d I think Americans are tired of the tweeter-in-chief\u2019s constant whining. They want a president focused on our nation, not a narcissist focused on airing his personal grievances. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL",

            "article_content": " In the past four months, Americans have stood witness to widespread arson, looting, vandalism, and the breakdown of law and order. Frequently, those committing and fomenting the violence claim they are fighting against systemic racism. I grew up in segregated Louisiana, where real systemic racism was part of daily life. Yet in my lifetime, the United States has achieved steady and strong racial progress, allowing Black men and women to be full and equal Americans. Individual racism will always exist; but in this country,\u00a0the\u00a0system\u00a0is no longer racist. Yet for decades, measures to \u201caddress\u201d the racism of the past have inflicted new racial discrimination on Americans. COULD CALIFORNIA\u2019S POLICIES WORK ON A FEDERAL SCALE UNDER A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION? In 1996, Californians roundly rejected such modern-day bigotry by adopting Proposition 209, which banned racial preferences and discrimination in public university admissions, public contracting, and public employment in the state. We \u2014 as Americans, as a united country \u2014 have achieved Dr. King\u2019s dream. Dr. King\u2019s children lived to be judged by what they do, not what they look like. Alas, nearly a quarter of a century later, the stokers of racial grievance have refused to let progress stand. They have mounted a campaign \u2014 Proposition 16 \u2014 to overturn California\u2019s existing race neutrality. It is no accident that this challenge to Prop 209 has arrived at the same time as mass protests and race riots. For four months now, thugs and rioters \u2014 along with the media and political class that enable them \u2014 have been tearing at the social fabric of this country. The unthinkable \u2014 such as defunding major police departments \u2014 has become accepted as \u201creform.\u201d Judging people based on their skin color has once again become accepted in the highest echelons of American society. Americans who speak out against such lawlessness and intolerance have been physically attacked for their race and political views. Measures to \u201caddress\u201d the racism of the past have inflicted new racial discrimination on Americans. Statues of the Founding Fathers and other historical figures, such as Christopher Columbus \u2014 even President Ulysses Grant and the Black abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass \u2014 have been torn down by rejoicing mobs. Each day, long-established political norms and moral values are being trashed, along with the social contract that Americans made with their government and each other. All this chaos and moral confusion is the perfect opening for supporters of Prop 16 to claim \u2014and be believed by far too many \u2014 that their aim is \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cequity,\u201d not a return to state-mandated practice of treating human beings as racial groups instead of individuals. In truth, the past four months have offered a cold reminder that equality, which is central to the American creed, can no longer be taken for granted. In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared in his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech: \u201cI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u2019\u2026 I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\u201d We \u2014 as Americans, as a united country \u2014 have achieved Dr. King\u2019s dream. Dr. King\u2019s children lived to be judged by what they do, not what they look like. Today, however, the official Black Lives Matter movement, along with radical leftist groups, such as Antifa \u2014 many of which are supported with millions of dollars from corporations, and all of whom are coddled by the left-wing media \u2014 make it a point to judge, target, and attack Americans based on the color of their skin. The country as a whole is now caught in a vicious spiral of undoing its hard-won racial equality, and California stands as the vanguard of this cultural revolution. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Soon after far-left state legislators put Prop 16 on the ballot, they adopted\u00a0measures\u00a0requiring hard racial quotas for corporate boards, forced racial indoctrination for students, and a committee to \u201cstudy\u201d issuing reparations for Californians whose ancestors were slaves. If Prop 16 passes, this virus of racial divisiveness will spread to the rest of the country. We, as Americans, cannot let that happen. We must remember the American creed and its true promise of equality, as stated by Dr. King. We must not remain silent as our country literally burns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In California, our defense of equality begins with upholding equal treatment under the law and saying no to the racial discrimination promised by Prop 16. We urge all Americans who believe in the foundational principles of this country to support us.",

            "article_content": "Close friends, members of the Supreme Court and family members of Ruth Bader Ginsburg hold a service as she arrives to lie in repose. Growing up as a Black girl in the 1960s and 1970s, my race and gender created unwanted obstacles to my equal treatment under the law and to opportunities open to me in education, employment, housing and many other areas. Thankfully, the civil rights movement and women\u2019s right movement knocked down some \u2014 though certainly not all \u2014 of those obstacles. This progress toward justice and equality was aided by many people, but two of the most important were courageous lawyers who became Supreme Court justices: Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice on our nation\u2019s highest court, died in 1993 at age 84. And on Friday we lost Ruth Bader Ginsburg at age 87. PELOSI ACCUSES TRUMP OF RUSHING TO FILL SUPREME COURT VACANCY TO REPEAL OBAMACARE Yet now, the pioneering achievements of Marshall and Ginsburg are threatened by President Trump. The president has dedicated himself to turning back the clock on progress to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by appointing as many conservative judges as possible to eliminate reproductive rights, voting rights, gay rights, and many other rights that have benefitted not just Black Americans and women but all Americans. Trump has already appointed two conservative justices to the Supreme Court. But now \u2014 in the waning days of his first (and hopefully final) term in the White House \u2014 he wants to rush through a far-right nominee to replace Ginsburg on the high court and take a wrecking ball to many of the hard-fought rights Ginsburg and Marshall won for the American people. And Trump\u2019s loyal servant in the Senate \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\u2014 is determined to do everything in his power to help Trump return America to \u201cthe good old days\u201d when Black people and women had far fewer rights than we deserve and enjoy today. Never mind that McConnell and Senate Republicans four years ago denied Democratic President Barack Obama his right under the Constitution to appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. McConnell invented a new rule then, falsely claiming a president had no right to appoint a justice to the high court in an election year. Obama nominated Garland almost eight months before Election Day. Trump says he will nominate a replacement for Ginsburg on Saturday \u2014 after early voting has already begun for the Nov. 3 election. But that\u2019s just fine by McConnell and Republican senators who bow before Trump. The hypocritical Republicans are only interested in wielding power and winning by any means necessary. Rules, they clearly feel, are for Democrats. Republicans believe they have the right to do whatever they want, they\u2019ve made clear. In Justice Ginsburg\u2019s final statement before her death, which she dictated to her granddaughter, Clara Spera, the dying justice said: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d The hypocritical Republicans are only interested in wielding power and winning by any means necessary. Not surprisingly, Trump and McConnell are ignoring Ginsburg\u2019s final wish. Trump even had the gall to claim \u2014 without a shred of evidence \u2014 that the statement might have been written by leading Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, both of California; or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, rather than Ginsburg. Ginsburg will go down in history as one of our greatest Supreme Court justices, while I\u2019m confident that history will judge Trump to be one of our worst presidents. Ginsburg\u2019s work as a lawyer and as a Supreme Court associate justice literally and figuratively wrote women into the U.S. Constitution. She belongs on the Mount Rushmore of American jurisprudence, along with Thurgood Marshall and Chief Justices Earl Warren and John Marshall. Ginsburg was known as \u201cthe Thurgood Marshall of gender equality law.\u201d She graduated tied for first in her Class of 1959 from Columbia Law School. Like many women lawyers of her day, she faced blatant sexism when she began her career. She was turned down for numerous law firm positions and also, ironically, for a law clerk position at the Supreme Court. But Ginsburg persevered and prevailed by becoming a law professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School and then rising to prominence as a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). At the ACLU, where she served for more than a decade, Ginsburg became the architect of a legal strategy to end gender discrimination in the U.S. Modeling her approach after Thurgood Marshall on race discrimination, Ginsburg worked on 34 Supreme Court cases \u2014 arguing six and winning five of them. Each case set a precedent for the next case to further expand rights and protections for American women. As the founding director of the ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project, Ginsburg developed a novel and counterintuitive legal strategy in gender discrimination cases. She found male plaintiffs to challenge laws that discriminated \u201con the basis of sex,\u201d a phrase that would later become the\u00a0title of a biopic on Ginsburg\u2019s life. One of the cases she worked on while at the ACLU, Reed v. Reed, resulted in a 1971 Supreme Court ruling that the Equal Protection Clause in the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment applies to women. This is now taken as a given, but was an enormous victory for women almost 50 years ago. Another case Ginsburg worked on, Craig v. Boren, led to the development of the test known as\u00a0\u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d\u00a0which requires proof of a substantial government interest before a law may be enacted that discriminates between men and women. Ginsburg\u2019s victory in 1976 protects women from gender discrimination to this day. In 1980 Ginsburg became a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, sometimes called \u201cthe little Supreme Court.\u201d And in 1993 Ginsburg was nominated by President Bill Clinton to serve on the Supreme Court. Notably, Ginsburg was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a 96-3 vote in the Senate. This bipartisan vote is, sadly, unthinkable for her replacement in today\u2019s toxic political environment. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER On the Supreme Court, Ginsburg continued her efforts to push for full gender equality under the 14th Amendment. In 1996 she wrote the Supreme Court\u2019s majority decision in\u00a0U.S. v. Virginia,\u00a0which struck down the male-only admission policy of the Virginia Military Institute and established a new standard of review for sex discrimination cases based on the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. In 2006, in a dissenting opinion in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, which Ginsburg read aloud from the bench, she said: \u201cThe court does not comprehend ... the insidious way that women can be victims to discrimination. The ball is in Congress\u2019 court.\u201d A few years later, Ginsburg\u2019s prescient dissent prevailed, when then-President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. Then in 2013, in another dissenting opinion in Shelby County v. Holder \u2014 in which the conservative justices of the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \u2014 Ginsburg rebuked her colleagues, stating that \u201cRace-based voting discrimination still exists.\u201d Truer words were never spoken.

With early voting completed and the return of mail-in ballots slowing, state figures released Monday show that out of 9 million ballots cast, 108,000 more Democrats have voted than Republicans. It is unknown who these voters cast ballots for, but Democrats are expected to overwhelmingly support former Vice President Joe Biden. The same applies to Republicans and Trump. Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is a must-win state for Trump to have a realistic chance of being reelected. The pre-Election Day margin in the president\u2019s adopted home state was slightly tighter in 2016, when 96,000 more Democrats voted early or by mail than Republicans out of 6.5 million cast \u2014 but Trump had a strong turnout on Election Day and carried the state over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 113,000 votes or 1.2 percentage points. There is one significant difference this time \u2014 because more voters have already cast ballots, significantly fewer are expected to show up Tuesday. In 2016, 3 million Floridians voted on Election Day. This year, between 1.5 million and 2 million are expected, meaning Trump will need to carry a larger percentage of those. Polls close at 7 p.m. Tuesday local time and mail-in ballots must be received by the voter\u2019s county by that hour to be counted.",

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the\u00a0prominent statue of Theodore Roosevelt in front of the American Museum of Natural History, will be removed after years of objections that it symbolizes colonial expansion and racial discrimination. \u201cThe American Museum of Natural History has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior,\u201d\u00a0de Blasio announced Sunday in a written statement about the statue erected in 1940 that depicts\u00a0Roosevelt on horseback with a Native American man and an African man standing next to the horse.\u00a0\u201cIt is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.\u201d Trump tweeted Monday: \"Ridiculous, don't do it.\" Ellen Futter, the museum's president, told the New York Times,\u00a0\u201cWe have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism. Simply put, the time has come to move it.\u201d Futter said the museum objected to the statue but not to Roosevelt, a pioneering conservationist whose father was a founding member of the institution and who served as New York's governor before becoming the 26th U.S. president. She said the museum was naming its Hall of Biodiversity for Roosevelt \u201cin recognition of his conservation legacy.\u201d Protesters in San Francisco defaced and toppled the statue\u00a0of former President Grant, who led the Union Army during the Civil War, in Golden State Park, on Friday, June 19. Many online pointed out the irony, though critics say he has a complicated relationship with slavery. \"He was a 'slave owner' in that he was gifted a slave, hated the idea, and freed him within a year. Then won the Civil War, prosecuted the KKK, and appointed African Americans to prominent roles in government,\"\u00a0Matt Whitlock wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\"This might have gotten out of hand.\" Around 400 people gathered that night and also tore down statues of St. Junipero Serra and Francis Scott Key, who wrote the lyrics to \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" (The Christopher Columbus statue in front of Columbus' City Hall was donated by the city of Genoa, Italy, in 1955.\u00a0\u00a0(Google)) The mayor of Columbus, Ohio announced Thursday, June 18, the state capitol plans to remove the city's namesake\u00a0Christopher Columbus statue that stands in front of City Hall in favor of \"diversity and inclusion.\" The statue, which had \"rapist\" spray-painted the day before by protesters,\u00a0will be replaced with a piece of new art that better represents the city and its people,\u00a0 FOX 28 in Columbus reported. The Columbus City Council expressed its \"sincere respect and thanks\" to the city of Genoa, Italy that gifted the statue in 1955, but the Columbus Piave Club found the sentiments of diversity and inclusion \"ironic\" because the Italian community was \"COMPLETELY\u00a0locked out\" of the conversation surrounding the statue's removal. Other Columbus statues have been vandalized and removed across the nation. In the first days of Floyd protests, the statue of Philadelphia abolitionist Matthias Baldwin was defaced with messages of \"colonizer\" and \"murderer,\" The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Baldwin, an industrialist, was an outspoken critic against slavery during the early 1800s, arguing for the right of African-Americans to vote and founding a school in the city for black children, and before the Civil War, Southern railroads refused to purchase his engines. The Baldwin statue was erected in 1906 and placed outside\u00a0City Hall in 1936. In Boston, the Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment Memorial, which honors African-American soldiers who fought in the Civil War,\u00a0was one of 16 public artworks damaged when thousands of protesters swarmed Boston Common May 31, according to public radio station\u00a0WBUR-FM. \u201cThis monument is considered one of the nation's greatest pieces of public art and the greatest piece to come out of the Civil War,\u201d Friends of the Public Garden executive director Liz Vizza told the station. \u201cIt was, amazingly enough, dedicated 123 years ago on May 31st \u2013 the day it was defaced.\u201d In Duluth, Minn., one of the city's most treasured memorials, the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, was vandalized with anti-police graffiti during protests that weekend. The memorial commemorates three black men wrongly lynched years ago after being accused of raping a woman,\u00a0Fox 21 Duluth\u00a0reported. \u201cI was hurt. I was hurt that we have to see that,\u201d Stephan Witherspoon, co-chair of the Memorial board and president of the local NAACP, told the station. In Denver, Colorado, a sculpture remembering the victims of the Armenian genocide was vandalized with anti-cop graffiti. \u201cSince the Khachkar commemorates the victims of all crimes against humanity, including slavery and state-sponsored racism, it is ironic that individuals who claim to seek justice have vandalized the very monument that honors the victims of injustice,\u201d Armenians of Colorado said in a statement. In Salt Lake City, protesters damaged the Serve and Protect bronze sculpture in front of the city\u2019s Public Safety Building with red paint. The sculpture is meant to symbolize the duty emergency responders have to protect and serve their communities, the\u00a0Salt Lake Tribune\u00a0reported. In Cleveland, the Soldiers & Sailors monument in the city\u2019s downtown was vandalized with graffiti when a protest turned into a riot May 30. Vandals also stole the monument\u2019s American flag, according to\u00a0WOIO-TV. In\u00a0Sacramento, the California Peace Officers\u2019 Memorial monument was vandalized Saturday during protests,\u00a0Fox 40 Sacramento\u00a0reported. The memorial is dedicated\u00a0to members of law enforcement killed in the line of duty. One statue\u2019s face was spray painted black, while another structure had the words \u201cF\u2014 the police\u201d spray-painted on it, the station reported. In Birmingham, Ala., a 97-year-old memorial honoring those who lost their lives in World War I was defaced and damaged amid a protest in the public park where it was located after protesters failed to take out their wrath on the park\u2019s Confederate monument, according to\u00a0WVTM-TV. Protesters tried to tear it down but were unable to, the station reported. City officials then removed both monuments but plan to return only the World War I monument to the park after undergoing repairs. Outside the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., protesters \"desecrated\" Mahatma Gandhi's statue. The\u00a0United States Park Police\u00a0launched an investigation and the Ken Juster, U.S. Ambassador to India, apologized, news agency ANI reported. \"So sorry to see the desecration of the Gandhi statue in Washington, DC. Please accept our sincere apologies... Appalled as well by the horrific death of George Floyd and the awful violence & vandalism. We stand against prejudice and discrimination of any type. We will recover and be better,\" Juster said. Gandhi\u00a0was the leader of India's non-violent independence movement against British rule and in South Africa who advocated for the civil rights of Indians. Martin Luther King, Jr. drew inspiration from Gandhi connecting Christianity to his non-violent movement. After a\u00a0statue in Washington, D.C., commemorating\u00a0Polish Revolutionary War hero Thaddeus Kosciuszko was vandalized,\u00a0Polish Ambassador Piotr Wilczek went on Twitter\u00a0to say he was \u201cdisgusted and appalled\u201d over what happened,\u00a0ArtNet\u00a0reported. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI implore @WhiteHouse & @NatlParkService to quickly restore the statue to its original state,\u201d he tweeted.

            "article_content": "Bryan Llenas reports as rioters come together in groups of hundreds to vandalize and loot storefronts. A majority of Americans say that police officers facing a dangerous situation are more likely to use excessive force if the suspect they\u2019re facing is black, according to a new national poll. And that percentage has surged over the past six years, according to a survey released Tuesday by Monmouth University. TAKING AIM AT TRUMP OVER PROTESTS, BIDEN CHARGES THE PRESIDENT'S 'PART OF THE PROBLEM' The poll also indicates that the number of people who consider racial and ethnic discrimination to be a major problem has soared in recent years. Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in the survey say that police officers facing a difficult situation are more likely to use excessive force against a black person, with a third saying that officers are just as likely to use excessive force against black or white culprits in the same type of situation. The poll was conducted Thursday through Monday, amid both peaceful protests and\u00a0violent clashes and rioting in cities across the country sparked by the death last week of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer put his knee to the handcuffed Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE NATIONWIDE UNREST SPARKED BY GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH The 57 percent saying police are more likely to use excessive force against a black suspect has nearly doubled from 33 percent in December 2014, after a grand jury declined to indict a white New York City police officer in the chokehold death of black man Eric Garner. According to the poll, 87 percent of African Americans, 63 percent of Americans of Latino, Asian and other minority backgrounds, and 49 percent of whites say that police are more likely to use excessive force against blacks. Only 17 percent of Americans say that the actions by some of the protesters \u2013 including the burning of police precinct in Minneapolis \u2013 are fully justified,\u00a0with another 37 percent saying they\u2019re partially justified. Nearly four in 10 said such actions are not justified at all. But a majority \u2013 57 percent \u2013 say that the anger that sparked the protests is fully justified,\u00a0with another 21 percent saying it\u2019s partially justified. \u201cIt seems we have reached a turning point in public opinion where white Americans are realizing that black Americans face risks when dealing with police that they do not. They may not agree with the violence of recent protests, but many whites say they understand where that anger is coming from,\u201d Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said. More than three-quarters of those questioned now say that racial and ethnic discrimination\u2019s a big problem in the U.S. \u2013 up from 51 percent in January of 2015 and from 68 percent in July of 2016. Other findings in the survey: Twenty-eight percent say they or an immediate family member\u2019s experienced harassment by the police \u2013 and 41 percent say they\u2019re very satisfied and another 30 percent say they\u2019re somewhat satisfied with their local police departments. Live telephone operators questioned 807 adults nationwide for the Monmouth University poll. The survey\u2019s sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",

John Lewis, D-Ga., Thursday afternoon, capping off a day of heartfelt tributes to honor the legacy of the civil rights icon and the example he set for America to keep marching\u00a0toward racial justice and a more perfect\u00a0union. \"John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America,\" Obama said. Former President Barack Obama, addresses the service during the funeral for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Thursday, July 30, 2020. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool) The funeral for the late\u00a0congressman\u00a0took place at Ebenezer Baptist Church in\u00a0Atlanta, Ga. -- the church where Martin Luther King, Jr., was\u00a0baptized\u00a0and served as a pastor and where his funeral was held after his 1968 assassination. Obama looked back on\u00a0Lewis's storied efforts to\u00a0dismantle America's system of\u00a0segregationism and prejudice while issuing a\u00a0political call to action to tackle today's unfinished business. Paramount is passing a new Voting Rights Act, Obama said. \"You want to honor, John? Let's honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for,\" Obama said. Obama then made a case for granting statehood to the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, turning\u00a0Election Day into\u00a0a national holiday, implementing automatic voter registration and getting rid of the Senate's filibuster, \"a Jim Crow relic,\"\u00a0to make these voting rights issues a reality. The former president turned his attention\u00a0to today's political turmoil. He referenced George Floyd\u2019s death, the Trump Administration\u00a0sending in federal agents to quash protests and challenges to mail-in voting\u00a0during this \u201curgent\u201d upcoming election. \u201cToday, we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGeorge Wallace may be gone. But we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators.\u201d Obama continued: \u201cWe may no longer have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar in order to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here, there are those in power, who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision -- even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that's going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don't get sick.\u201d Former President Barack Obama, addresses the service during the funeral for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Thursday, July 30, 2020. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool) Obama acknowledged his political remarks may be unwelcomed by some. \u201cI know this is a celebration of John's life,\" Obama said. \"There are some who might say we shouldn't dwell on such things. But that's why\u00a0I'm talking about it. John was devoting his time on this earth [to] fighting the very attacks on democracy.\u201d Three former American\u00a0presidents\u00a0gave tributes at\u00a0Lewis' funeral Thursday -- George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Obama. About 50\u00a0of Lewis' colleagues from\u00a0the House attended the Atlanta service\u00a0as well as Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J. Bush, the first former president to speak,\u00a0told a story of a young Lewis raising chickens in Troy, Ala. and how he cared so much for the flock that he baptized them, married them and preached to them. When his parents wanted to eat one for dinner, Lewis refused. \u201cGoing hungry was his first act of nonviolent protest,\u201d Bush quipped. Bush recalled working with Lewis to bring the National Museum of African American History to the National Mall in Washington and passing the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. \u201cJohn Lewis believed in the Lord. He believed in humanity and he believed in America,\" said Bush, who was joined by former first lady Laura Bush. \"He\u2019s been called an American saint.\u201d Clinton honored Lewis' passion\u00a0to keep moving toward progress no matter the adversity. \"It's important that all of us who loved him remember that he was after all a\u00a0human being -- a\u00a0man like all other humans, born with strengths that he made the most of when many\u00a0don't,\" Clinton said. \"Born with weaknesses, that he worked hard to beat down when many can't. He was still a person. It made it more interesting and it made him, in my mind, even greater.\" Clinton marveled at Lewis' final letter -- published in The New York Times -- that gave the country hope. POSTHUMOUS LETTER FROM JOHN LEWIS PUBLISHED \"It is so fitting on the day of his service. He leaves us\u00a0our marching orders: Keep moving,\" Clinton said. Former President Bill Clinton speaks during the funeral service for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Thursday, July 30, 2020. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool) Lewis, a longtime friend of the Clintons, initially endorsed Hillary Clinton, then a senator from New York,\u00a0during the 2008 presidential election,\u00a0but switched to Obama after the Georgia primary to reflect the will of his constituents. \"Something is happening in America,\" Lewis said at the time in backing Obama.\u00a0\"There is a movement, there is a spirit, there is an enthusiasm in the hearts and minds of the American people that I have not seen in a long time, since the candidacy of Robert Kennedy. The people are pressing for a new day in American politics, and I think they see Sen. Barack Obama as a symbol of that change.\" Obama honored Lewis in 2011 with the Presidential\u00a0Medal of Freedom. During the White House ceremony, Obama recalled Lewis returning to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. even after he was beaten within an inch of his life. Obama said for generations\u00a0from now parents will evoke Lewis when they teach their children about courage.

John Lewis, D-Ga., during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Lewis, who carried the struggle against racial discrimination from Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress, died Friday, July 17, 2020. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Obama began his tribute Thursday\u00a0by calling Lewis\u00a0\"a man of pure joy and unbreakable perseverance\" and thanking Lewis for his mentorship. \"I've come here today because I, like so many Americans, owe a great debt to John Lewis and his forceful vision of freedom,\" the nation's first African American president said. Obama first met Lewis when he was a law school student. The young Obama approached Lewis after his speech and said: \"You are one of my heroes.\" Obama recalled Lewis's humble beginnings and setting out on his dangerous mission to change America by boarding a segregated bus with friend Bernard Lafayette. \"Imagine the courage of two people Malia's age, younger than my oldest daughter, on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression,\"\u00a0Obama said. \"John was only 20 years old.\" Lewis was the son of Alabama sharecroppers and engaged in decades of activism before being elected to Congress in 1987 and living to see Obama's inauguration\u00a0in 2009. After the inauguration, Lewis asked the newly minted president to sign his program. Obama told his hero the historic day was for him,\u00a0too. He signed the program: \u201cBecause of you, John.\u201d REP. JOHN LEWIS: TIMELINE OF EVENTS IN A REMARKABLE LIFE Lewis said he never could have dreamed of an African American president. \"When we were organizing voter-registration drives, going on the Freedom Rides, sitting in, coming here to Washington for the first time, getting arrested, going to jail, being beaten, I never thought \u2014 I never dreamed \u2014 of the possibility that an African American would one day be elected president of the United States,\u201d Lewis wrote shortly before Obama assumed office. Lewis by 1963 had been arrested no fewer than 24 times while protesting, and by the end of his career had been arrested more than 40 times. He liked to talk about getting into \"good trouble.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who often called Lewis the \"conscience of the Congres,\" shared one example of Lewis making mischief by leading a\u00a0sit-in on the House floor in 2016 to call for a vote on gun control in the wake of the Pulse Nightclub massacre. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi applauds during the funeral service for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Thursday, July 30, 2020. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool) She marveled at\u00a0the double rainbow that appeared in Washington this week above Lewis' casket and said it was a sign from above. \"He was telling us 'I'm home in heaven,\"' Pelosi said. \"...We always knew he worked on the side of the angels. And now he is with them. May he rest in peace.\" King Jr.'s daughter Bernice King led a prayer thanking God for the\u00a0\"non-violent warrior\" and called for \"good trouble\" to continue until\u00a0\"Black bodies are no longer a threat in this world, and Black lives have equitable representation, power and influence in every arena.\" Arthur Blank pays his respects to the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., before the funeral service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Thursday, July 30, 2020. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool) President Trump and former President Jimmy Carter, 95, were\u00a0not in attendance. A letter from Carter, however, was\u00a0read at the funeral. Lewis this week was lying in state at the U.S. Capitol for three days as part of a six-day celebration of his life planned by his family. The celebration\u00a0included a processional over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where he was beaten in 1965 as he led a group marching from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery, Ala., protesting obstacles to Black peoples' right to vote. Lewis also\u00a0was honored at the Alabama state Capitol and his casket was driven past\u00a0the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., where he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington -- the event where King, Jr., made his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. JOHN LEWIS, CIVIL RIGHTS ICON, CONGRESSMAN FOR 33 YEARS, DEAD AT 80 When Lewis was 15, he heard King\u2019s sermons on WRMA, a radio station in Montgomery, Ala., he\u00a0recalled\u00a0in an interview for the Southern Oral History Program. Former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush are seated for the funeral service for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Thursday, July 30, 2020.

According to its\u00a0website, South-View Cemetery was founded after the end of the Civil War by former slaves and inters the bodies of more than 80,000 African Americans.

The U.S. Supreme Court said Friday it would review a 2016 Arizona law that prohibits anyone but a\u00a0family member or caregiver from returning another person\u2019s early ballot. SCHUMER CALLS SUPREME COURT HEARING 'IRRESPONSIBLE AND DANGEROUS' AFTER SENATORS TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS In January,\u00a0a federal appeals court ruled that\u00a0Arizona\u2019s law banning so-called \u201cballot harvesting\u201d violates the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. Any further action has been stayed until the Supreme Court weighs in on the matter. Its\u00a0new term begins next week. The appeals court also found that Arizona's policy of\u00a0discarding ballots if a voter went to the wrong precinct violates the law, arguing both measures have a\u00a0discriminatory impact on minority voters. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File) The harvesting case began with Democrats suing over a law passed by Arizona Republicans that made\u00a0it a felony to return someone else\u2019s ballot to election officials in most cases. Both parties had used ballot collection to boost turnout during elections by canvassing \u2013\u00a0asking voters if they had completed their mail-in ballots. Democrats, who found success in minority communities, said Republicans introduced the measure because of their accomplishments, while Republicans said the law was\u00a0aimed at preventing election fraud. It remains in effect until the Supreme Court rules. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that\u00a0he is pleased the high court will hear the case. The eight justices will not be returning to the courtroom to hear arguments in person due to the coronavirus pandemic but will participate over the telephone.

Booker, that seems an odd thing for me to express an opinion on,\u201d Barrett said in response. \u201cI\u2019m not asking \u2013 these are facts. These are just facts,\u201d Booker said. BARRETT VOWS TO CONSIDER 'EVERY FACTOR' IN DECIDING WHETHER TO RECUSE FROM ELECTION CASES \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that study,\u201d Barrett responded. \u201cAs you and I have discussed, I am aware that there is evidence and there have been studies of systemic racism or implicit bias in the justice system, so I am aware of that issue.\u201d Booker pressed Barrett on whether she has heard cases on the subject and asked the nominee if she believed there was implicit racial bias in the criminal justice system. \u201cSenator, it would be hard to imagine that a criminal justice system as big as ours not having any implicit bias,\u201d Barrett said. Booker referenced a case involving a Black traffic patrol officer in Illinois who alleged he had been fired for his complaints about racial discrimination in the workplace. The senator noted that Barrett ruled a supervisor\u2019s use of the N-word toward the employee did not prove a hostile work environment that contributed to his firing. Booker added that Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a similar case, had ruled that the use of the N-word by a supervisor in the workplace \u201csuffices by itself\u201d to establish a racially hostile work environment. AMY CONEY BARRETT FACES PRESSURE DURING HEARING, RESPONDS WITH GRACE AND POISE, EXPERTS SAY \u201cI\u2019m very surprised to have to make this point at all, but even a staunch conservative like Justice Kavanaugh, in my questioning of him, spoke to the obvious harm here in a way that you don\u2019t seem to,\u201d Booker said. Barrett pushed back on Booker\u2019s remarks. \u201cSenator Booker, that opinion does not take a position different than Justice Kavanaugh. It expressly, and was written very carefully, to leave open the possibility that one use of that word would be sufficient to make out a hostile work environment claim,\u201d Barrett said. The nominee added that the plaintiff Booker referenced did not plead his case to say the use of the racial slur altered the terms of his employment and had based his hostile work environment claim on a supervisor\u2019s \u201cuse of expletives at him based on poor work performance.\u201d BARRETT SAYS SHE IS NOT 'HOSTILE' TO OBAMACARE \u201cAs a panel, we were constrained to decide based on the case the plaintiff had presented before us,\u201d she added. Booker\u2019s earlier questions sought Barrett\u2019s response to a number of current political debates, including President Trump\u2019s recent refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. Barrett declined to offer an opinion on the situation. The senator also asked Barrett if she would condemn White supremacy. Barrett said that she did. \u201cI wish our president would say that so resolutely and unequivocally as well, but we are at a time that Americans are literally fearful because their president cannot do that in the resolute manner you did,\" Booker said.\u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry that question even had to be asked at this time.\u201d Senate hearings on Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation are scheduled to continue through Thursday.",

How did we go from a point where most Democrats opposed gay marriage to one where conservative Republicans were celebrating the triumphs of the gay rights movement?We know the issues here still have their holdouts and that radicals at both ends of the spectrum are still out there looking for a fight. Virginia Republicans just dumped a congressman and may lose a House seat to punish him for officiating the gay wedding of two of his former staffers. And we have only just begun what will be years of back and forth over transgender issues.But on that central issue that had been a predictable breakwater in American politics since the birth of gay-rights movement in the 1970s, the conflict is over, and it happened in a historical blink of an eye.What we are apt to forget, and what many politicians refuse to believe, is that in the long run public sentiment drives policies far more than policies drive public sentiment.Generational change, shifting attitudes and cultural norms cannot be constrained by legislation. Laws can retard changes like these, but ultimately are their own undoing as citizens come to view them as unjust. And just like that, an issue that substantially defined a decade of the political culture wars becomes a moot point.It is useful then to wonder what other issues may be mooted in the decade ahead.For instance: Will Republicans and Democrats, who have made nice livings off of illegal immigration and the resentment over immigration laws since the mid-aughts one day wake up to find that the issue no longer pulls the plough? Another decade of low immigration and the generational change among Hispanic voters may do the trick.Consider what is happening with late-term abortion. Thanks to technological advances in ultrasound and neonatal care for premature births, the absolutist position on elective abortions at any point during a pregnancy has become unsustainable. Restrictions on late-term abortions are now broadly popular and are now in place in many states across the country. Politicians did not change attitudes here, but rather responded to attitudinal changes.Or how about our current hot button of black Americans and police?We seem to be about midway through a process not unlike what we saw on gay rights. As a recent poll taken by the WaPo and George Mason University found tectonic changes in attitudes on the subject since 2014 \u2013 including a 33 point shift among white Americans on the question of whether police killings like the one in Minneapolis are isolated incidents or reflect a larger problem.While Baby Boomers see this fight through the lens of the riots of 1967 through the early 1970s \u2013 an armed confrontation between black anarchists and white authoritarians \u2013 it seems like younger voters have moved on to a different paradigm that is far less oriented around us vs. them.That won\u2019t change this summer or solve this apparent impasse overnight, but it seems like we may be seeing another shift on par with the one highlighted at the Supreme Court this week.But when voters sort out what they think about how to deal with policing, you can bet that the same politicians who once wielded the wedge on both sides will be there for the first chorus of \u201cKumbaya.\u201d\u00a0THE RULEBOOK: RHYME AND REASON\u201cIngenious men may declaim with plausibility on any subject; but no human ingenuity can point out any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the public treasury.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30TIME OUT: WEEEEEEEE!History: \u201cOn June 16, 1884, the first roller coaster in America opens at Coney Island, in Brooklyn, New York. Known as a switchback railway, it was the brainchild of LaMarcus Thompson, traveled approximately six miles per hour and cost a nickel to ride. The new entertainment was an instant success and by the turn of the century there were hundreds of roller coasters around the country. \u2026 The first hotel opened at Coney Island in 1829 and by the post-Civil War years, the area was an established resort with theaters, restaurants and a race track. Between 1897 and 1904, three amusement parks sprang up at Coney Island\u2013Dreamland, Luna Park and Steeplechase. By the 1920s, Coney Island was reachable by subway and summer crowds of a million people a day flocked there for rides, games, sideshows, the beach and the two-and-a-half-mile boardwalk, completed in 1923.\u201d Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\u00a0\u00a0NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE\u00a0Trump: 41.8 percent\u00a0Biden: 50.2 percent\u00a0Size of lead: Biden by 8.4 pointsChange from one week ago: First week of average[Average includes: CNN: Trump 41% - Biden 55%; NBC News/WSJ: Trump 42% - Biden 49%; NPR/PBS/Marist: Trump 43% - Biden 50%; IBD: Trump 42% - Biden 49%; Monmouth University: Trump 41% - Biden 52%.]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up: (103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R: (186 electoral votes)\u00a0Lean D/Likely D: (249 electoral votes)[Full rankings here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 40.6 percentAverage disapproval: 55 percentNet Score: -14.4 pointsChange from one week ago: \u2193 2 points[Average includes: CNN: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; NPR/PBS: 42% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 42% approve - 52% disapprove; Gallup: 39% approve - 57% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 54% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

In Rose Garden remarks, Trump stressed the need for higher standards and commiserated with mourning families, even as he hailed the vast majority of officers as selfless public servants and held his law-and-order line, while criticizing Democrats. \u2026 Trump\u2019s executive order would establish a database that tracks police officers with excessive use of force complaints in their records. And it would give police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices and encourage \u2026 programs in which social workers join police when they respond to nonviolent calls\u2026.Trump said that, as part of the order, the use of chokeholds would be banned \u2018except if an officer\u2019s life is at risk.\u2019\u201dBlack officers say existing discrimination complicates reform efforts - WSJ: \u201cMany black officers said they understood the anger behind nationwide protests initially sparked by the killing of George Floyd. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they police minority communities, these officers said, but departments also need to change how they treat their own minority officers. \u2018The same hell that black people were experiencing on the streets, we were experiencing inside the department,\u2019 said Eric Adams, who retired from the New York Police Department as a captain in 2006. Mr. Adams, who is now Brooklyn borough president, said the dynamic hasn\u2019t changed. \u2026 The Wall Street Journal has identified nearly two dozen lawsuits or settlements involving black officers who alleged discrimination against departments across the country over the past three years.\u201dMan shot at New Mexico conquistador statue protest - NYT: \u201cGunfire broke out during a protest Monday night in Albuquerque to demand the removal of a statue of Juan de O\u00f1ate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico whose image has become the latest target in demonstrations across the country aimed at righting a history of racial injustice. As dozens of people gathered around a statue of O\u00f1ate, New Mexico\u2019s 16th-century colonial governor, shouting matches erupted over proposals to take it down and a man was shot, prompting police officers in riot gear to rush in. The man, who was not identified, was taken away in an ambulance, and the police took into custody several members of a right-wing militia who were dressed in camouflage and carrying military-style rifles. \u2026 Chief Michael Geier of the Albuquerque Police Department said on Twitter that authorities were investigating reports that vigilante groups instigated the violence.\u201d PENCE SAYS TRUMP MAY DUMP INDOOR RALLY ON SATURDAYUSA Today: \u201cVice President Mike Pence said Tuesday planning for President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a \u2018work in progress\u2019 and that other venues were being looked at, including \u2018outside activities\u2019 because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. Asked on \u2018Fox and Friends\u2019 about holding the Saturday rally outdoors because of the coronavirus, Pence said, \u2018you raise a good point.\u2019 \u2018What I can tell you is it's all a work in progress,\u2019 Pence continued. \u2018We've had such an overwhelming response that we're also looking at another venue. We're also looking at outside activities and I know the campaign team will keep the public informed as that goes forward.\u2019 The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pence's remarks.\u201dMichigan poll finds Trump trailing Biden by 16 points - Detroit Free Press: \u201cThe damage done to President Donald Trump's standing in Michigan following recent protests outside the White House and in cities across the U.S. may have been even greater than originally believed, a new poll released to the Free Press said Tuesday. Two weeks ago, EPIC-MRA of Lansing, a polling firm that does work for the Free Press, released a survey showing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, leading Trump 53%-41% in Michigan, a 12-point edge. But a second poll, started on May 31, a day after the first poll began, and concluded a day later than the first poll, on June 4, showed Biden leading Trump 55%-39% in Michigan, a 16-point margin. As it did for the first poll, EPIC-MRA surveyed 600 randomly selected likely voters for the second one, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\u201dDingell: \u2018I don't believe these numbers\u2019 - The Detroit News: \u201cTwo top Michigan Democrats urged caution Monday for supporters of Joe Biden, arguing that backers of the former vice president shouldn't become complacent despite favorable polling ahead of the November election. During an online event launching an effort called Michigan Women for Biden, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, introduced herself as \u2018Debbie Downer.\u2019 \u2018Some people say, \u2018Oh, look at the numbers,\u2019\u2019 Dingell said. \u2018I don\u2019t believe these numbers.\u2019 \u2026 Real Clear Politics currently shows Biden to have a 7.3% lead over President Donald Trump in its average of recent polling in Michigan and an 8.1% average polling lead nationally.\u201dTrump ahead by a hair in latest Iowa poll - Des Moines Register: \u201cFour years after Republican Donald Trump decisively won Iowa and the presidency, the state appears to be a toss-up as he seeks re-election this November, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Trump carried Iowa by 9 percentage points in his 2016 contest against Democrat Hillary Clinton. But today, the Register\u2019s Iowa Poll shows the president leading former Vice President Joe Biden by just 1 point \u2014 44% to 43%. The poll of 674 likely voters was conducted June 7-10 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. The results \u2014 which come in the midst of a pandemic and widespread civil unrest \u2014 are among a wave of polling that indicates an increasingly unstable electoral map for the president. States like Iowa that were expected to be safe territory for him after clear wins in 2016 now appear to be battlegrounds in 2020.\u201dBIDEN CRUSHES FUNDRAISING RECORD CNBC: \u201cJoe Biden and the Democratic National Committee combined to raise over $80 million in May, their largest fundraising haul of the 2020 election cycle. The campaign announced the record total in an email to supporters on Monday. The average online donation to the campaign was $30. More than half of their donors in May were new supporters. The campaign has tripled their total number of online donors since February. Educators were the majority of financial supporters for Biden last month. Biden\u2019s fundraising success comes as President Donald Trump has been struggling in most national polls. A Real Clear Politics polling average shows Biden up just over seven points. The president has come under scrutiny for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his administration\u2019s response to nationwide protests after the death of George Floyd.\u201dFeels heat on policing policies - AP: \u201cMore than four dozen progressive groups have signed a letter to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s campaign criticizing his police reform proposals and warning that if he doesn\u2019t adopt more progressive policies he risks losing black voters \u2014 and the election \u2014 this fall.\u00a0 \u2026 It criticizes in particular Biden\u2019s commitment to add $300 million in funding for community policing programs, arguing that such programs have contributed to police violence against black Americans. \u2026 The letter, which is signed by more than 50 groups, including the Bernie Sanders-linked Our Revolution, Black Voters Matter, and the League of United Latin American Citizens, among others, was dated June 11, nearly two weeks into the nationwide protests \u2014 and renewed conversation around criminal justice and policing reform \u2014 that erupted in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing. It also came the day after Biden wrote a USA Today op-ed that reiterated his earlier proposal to add new funds for community policing.\u201dTRUMP MAY PUSH $1 IN NEW SPENDING\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201cThe Trump administration is preparing a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure proposal as part of its push to spur the world\u2019s largest economy back to life, according to people familiar with the plan. A preliminary version being prepared by the Department of Transportation would reserve most of the money for traditional infrastructure work, like roads and bridges, but would also set aside funds for 5G wireless infrastructure and rural broadband, the people said. President Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss rural broadband access at a White House event on Thursday. An existing U.S. infrastructure funding law is up for renewal by Sept. 30, and the administration sees that as a possible vehicle to push through a broader package, the people said. They asked not to be identified because the Trump proposal isn\u2019t final and hasn\u2019t been announced.\u201dReport: Members of Congress benefited from small-business loans - Politico: \u201cAt least four members of Congress have reaped benefits in some way from the half-trillion-dollar small-business loan program they helped create. And no one knows how many more there could be. It\u2019s a bipartisan group of lawmakers who have acknowledged close ties to companies that have received loans from the program \u2014 businesses that are either run by their families or employ their spouse as a senior executive. Republicans on the list include Rep. Roger Williams of Texas, a wealthy businessman who owns auto dealerships, body shops and car washes, and Rep. Vicky Hartzler of Missouri, whose family owns multiple farms and equipment suppliers across the Midwest. The Democrats count Rep. Susie Lee of Nevada, whose husband is CEO of a regional casino developer, and Rep. Debbie Mucarsel Powell of Florida, whose husband is an executive at a restaurant chain that has since returned the loan.\u201dHouse Dems put pressure on WH over bailout oversight - NYT: \u201cHouse Democrats opened an investigation on Monday into the distribution of more than $500 billion in small-business loans under a pandemic relief program, escalating a clash with the Trump administration as it resists oversight of trillions of dollars in coronavirus assistance funds. The announcement from the seven Democrats on a committee created to scrutinize how the administration is spending pandemic relief money came as Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, abruptly pivoted under pressure from lawmakers and said he would work to disclose more about where government-backed money was going through the lending initiative, the Paycheck Protection Program. It was the latest indication that, despite attempts by lawmakers to build layers of oversight into the largest stimulus program of its kind in modern history, an administration that has been hostile to congressional scrutiny continues to resist.\u201dPence downplayed new outbreaks to governors - NYT: \u201cVice President Mike Pence encouraged governors on Monday to adopt the administration\u2019s explanation that a rise in testing was a reason behind new coronavirus outbreaks, even though testing data has shown that such a claim is misleading. \u2018I would just encourage you all, as we talk about these things, to make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,\u2019 Mr. Pence said on a call with governors, audio of which was obtained by The New York Times. \u2018And that in most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that\u2019s more a result of the extraordinary work you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201dMLB commissioner warns season could be off - WSJ: \u201cThe escalating labor feud between Major League Baseball and its players\u2019 union walked to the precipice of a cliff Monday, when commissioner Rob Manfred said it is possible that there will be no season at all in 2020. Manfred\u2019s statement came just five days after he guaranteed MLB would at least play an abbreviated season amid the coronavirus pandemic. But as talks with the Major League Baseball Players Association ground to a halt in recent days, Manfred said even the 50-game campaign that had been discussed is imperiled. \u2018The owners are 100% committed to getting baseball back on the field,\u2019 Manfred said. \u2018Unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m 100% certain that\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201dWARREN BACKS CHALLENGER IN NASTY HOUSE PRIMARYFox News: \u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren is wading into a fierce primary battle in New York between longtime Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel and his progressive primary challenger -- middle school principal Jamaal Bowman. \u2026 The backing of the populist senator from Massachusetts and former White House hopeful who ended her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in March comes a week after Bowman was endorsed by two other big progressives in Congress, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. \u2026 As he fights for his political life, Engel\u2019s also getting help from some of the top Democrats in the House of Representatives. On Sunday and Monday, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee landed the backing of Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina \u2013 the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber \u2013 as well as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of\u00a0California and fellow New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus.\u201dHillary in the fray, too - NYT: \u201cHillary Clinton delivered her first Democratic primary endorsement in a 2020 House race on Monday, throwing her support behind Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, who is trying to fend off a serious challenge from his left after more than three decades in Congress. \u2018I have worked with Eliot Engel as first lady, as senator from New York and as secretary of state,\u2019 Mrs. Clinton said in a statement provided to The New York Times. \u2018Every step of the way, his No. 1 priority has always remained the same: delivering for his constituents.\u2019 The endorsement puts Mrs. Clinton on the opposite side of a wave of progressives who are backing Mr. Engel\u2019s leading challenger, Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; the Working Families Party; Justice Democrats; and MoveOn, the progressive advocacy group.\u201dBullock feels coronavirus response boost in Senate bid - WSJ: \u201cThree days after Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced his Senate bid, he declared a statewide emergency. That was March 12, before there were any known cases of the novel coronavirus in Montana. News broke the next day that four Montanans were \u2018presumptively positive.\u2019 On March 15, Mr. Bullock, the only sitting governor running for Senate, halted nursing-home visits. He also closed the state\u2019s schools before hot spots such as New York and New Jersey did the same. \u2026 But with frequent news conferences on coronavirus, Mr. Bullock is commanding much more local media attention than his Republican rival, incumbent Sen. Steve Daines. David Parker, chairman of Montana State University\u2019s political science department, found that the number of local news articles mentioning Mr. Bullock jumped from 184 in February to 809 in March, while Mr. Daines\u2019s mentions remained almost the same.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYAfter a nearly two decade hiatus federal executions to resume - NPRHouse sets D.C. statehood vote for June 26 - Roll CallHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s powers may remain despite moves to end rule by decree - NYTAUDIBLE: THE HORROR...\u201cThe only bad thing is I have completely lost sense of taste and smell. CAN\u2019T TASTE BACON!!!\u201d \u2013 Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C., in his statement about his mild case of coronavirus.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cWhat was the reason for the statue being made and what was the honor that made it possible? Also is the Halftime Report a news or opinion report? Seems like you are more of an opinion than just the facts of the story. We can make up our own minds about what we think is right all you have to do is give us the facts of what is going on from both sides of the issue without stating what you think about the situation. If I can ask one more question, why are so many people against the President? That has never been stated that I have heard anyway only that he must be removed. He has been attacked ever since he announced his candidacy. All I've heard has been LIES about him he has done more for the country and citizens than any President has for a very long time. I don't agree with all of his tweets, but he doesn't leave any doubt about what he thinks and follows up with action.\u201d \u2013 W.M. Hockett, Twain Harte, Calif.[Ed. note: First, I can\u2019t tell you how much I love the name of your town! It\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of it, and once I read up I was even more enamored of your little mountain community. A scenic wonder named after two great authors? I\u2019m in. As to your first question, we have been talking here a great deal lately about American history in regard to the statue debate. I wanted to give the proponents of keeping up Confederate monuments their due. And while I certainly am not hesitant in my enthusiasm for Abraham Lincoln and the Founding Fathers, I did not mean to let a historical debate slide into current events. I don\u2019t care what other people in other places want to honor or dishonor with names and statues on a local level. It\u2019s their business and I happily leave them to it. Plus, few will ever do better than you guys with Mark Twain and Brett Harte! Anyway, I think we can let the matter drop for a while. As to your second question, don\u2019t kid a kidder, Mr. Hockett\u2026 You know perfectly well that President Trump\u2019s brand is about conflict and drama. You should not be surprised that a person whose political career has thrived on the reactions he elicits from his critics would have so many of them. His supporters, you included, I\u2019d guess, like that he kicks over hornets\u2019 nests. Consequently, he gets stung more than the typical politician. Now, Trump would have had plenty of naysayers if he had pursued the same policies in a polite, unassuming way -- every president does. No president has taken the oath without more than 40 percent of the electorate having voted against them since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But Trump loves the chaos and conflict in ways that no else ever has, so don\u2019t act so surprised that he has detractors.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.DARN TOOTIN\u2019AP: \u201cA man in Vienna has been fined 500 euros ($565) for breaking wind loudly in front of police \u2014 a move that the Austrian capital's police force was at pains to defend on Tuesday. The Oesterreich newspaper reported that the fine stemmed from an incident on June 5 and that the offender was fined for \u2018offending public decency.\u2019 City police wrote on Twitter that \u2018of course no one is reported for accidentally \u2018letting one go.\u2019\u2019 They added that the man had behaved \u2018provocatively and uncooperatively\u2019 during an encounter with officers that preceded the incident. He got up from a park bench, looked at officers and \u2018let go a massive intestinal wind apparently with full intent,\u2019 they said. \u2018And our colleagues don't like to be farted at so much.\u2019 Police noted that the decision could be appealed.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cClinton made humility his vocation, apologizing variously for African slavery, for internment of Japanese Americans, for not saving Rwanda.

In his darker moments, Wilson revealed his pitch-black soul. FORMER REP. ALLEN WEST: JULY 4TH HAS SPECIAL MEANING FOR ME AS A BLACK MAN WHO OVERCAME DISCRIMINATION The\u00a0longtime\u00a0Democrat hero, once beloved by the Left for\u00a0launching the income tax\u00a0and\u00a0promoting\u00a0the League of Nations, hosted a\u00a01915\u00a0White House\u00a0screening of the pro-KKK\u00a0film, \u201cThe\u00a0Birth of a Nation.\u201d Wilson\u00a0said of\u00a0D.W. Griffith\u2019s\u00a0motion picture,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like writing history with lightning. My only regret is that it is all so terribly true.\u201d\u00a0Despite this ugliness, critics still\u00a0applaud\u00a0this\u00a0cinematic milestone\u2019s\u00a0silent\u00a0storytelling artistry. There is no saving grace\u00a0for\u00a0Wilson\u2019s\u00a0resegregation\u00a0of\u00a0the previously integrated bathrooms in what is now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building \u2014\u00a0immediately west of the White House. As the relevant order stated: \u201cBeginning Wednesday, Aug. 9, 1916, the toilets in the state, war and navy department buildings will be allotted for use as toilets\u2026 For Women\u2026 For White Men\u2026 [and] For Colored Men.\u201d This\u00a0document\u00a0was signed by\u00a0none other than\u00a0Assistant Secretary of the Navy\u00a0Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \u201cHe segregated the federal civil service after it had been racially integrated for decades,\u201d\u00a0Eisgruber said of Wilson,\u00a0\u201cthereby taking America backward in its pursuit of justice.\u201d Princeton\u2019s divorce from\u00a0this racist Democrat is\u00a0understandable and\u00a0far\u00a0less\u00a0problematic\u00a0than vandalizing and destroying statues\u00a0and\u00a0other public artworks\u00a0that\u00a0tell\u00a0the history of America\u00a0the beautiful \u2014\u00a0and the blemished. Still, what does\u00a0Princeton\u2019s gesture really\u00a0accomplish? Not to be outdone, Wilson\u2019s successor in Trenton has declared war on \u2026 his desk. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat,\u00a0suddenly ditched the desk that served Wilson and\u00a0subsequent governors. How\u00a0odd. Murphy\u2019s move\u00a0anthropomorphizes a\u00a0stick\u00a0of furniture. Wilson\u202fused\u202fthe desk.\u00a0It is neither a\u00a0bust\u00a0nor a carving of America\u2019s\u00a028th\u00a0president. Murphy has injected\u00a0symbolism\u00a0into\u00a0something that\u00a0does not\u00a0symbolize\u00a0the\u00a0hated\u00a0person\u00a0du jour. Wilson\u00a0surely\u00a0strolled\u00a0across Princeton\u2019s walkways.\u00a0Why not jackhammer the offending paths and replace them with\u00a0freshly poured\u00a0concrete? Did Wilson\u00a0sleep even one night in\u00a0the\u00a0official\u00a0governor\u2019s mansion? If so, burn it down! Meanwhile,\u00a0Boston University seems poised to cancel its school mascot. If this Boston\u00a0terrier\u00a0were named\u00a0Robert E. Lee,\u00a0one might\u00a0sympathize. But BU\u2019s avatar is\u00a0a\u00a0dog named\u00a0Rhett. The pup\u00a0was christened\u00a0after\u202fRhett Butler, an imaginary character in\u202f\u201cGone with the Wind,\u201d a work of fiction. BU\u2019s school color is scarlet,\u00a0much\u00a0like Scarlett, as in Scarlett O\u2019Hara, Rhett\u2019s\u00a0literary and cinematic\u00a0wife in\u202fGWTW. So, Rhett, the dog, is\u00a0leashed\u00a0to these make-believe characters\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0invented tale. How\u00a0silly.

Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on Thursday that the company would commit $100 million to fight for racial equality and justice across the globe. Cook, who made the announcement on Twitter,\u00a0said the company's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative will initially start in the U.S., specifically focusing on areas such as education, economic equality and criminal justice reform. \"We're at an important moment in our history,\" Cook said in the video. \"A time when progress, which has been far too slow, feels suddenly poised to move forward in a great leap. Each of us has a role to play in making sure we rise to the occasion. Things must change and Apple is committed to being a force for that change.\" File photo: Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., arrives for the morning session of the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Friday, July 12, 2019. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images APPLE'S TIM COOK SAYS COMPANY MUST DO MORE TO COMBAT RACISM Cook's passion for human rights is well documented. In the past, the 59-year-old Alabama native\u00a0has said he has a photo of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy on his desk and has a quote from King in his Twitter bio. Cook, as well as Apple, have both commemorated King\u00a0both on social media and on the company's homepage. The venerable tech exec added the program will eventually expand globally \"over time,\" and noted the program will be led by Apple vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson. \"Fighting for equality and justice for my community has driven my career as an environmentalist,\" Jackson wrote on Twitter. \"I\u2019ll continue the work leading Apple\u2019s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative,\" adding the hashtag BlackLivesMatter. In addition to the initiative, Cook said that Apple would add a new developer camp for Black developers to its developer conference, WWDC, slated to start on June 22. Apple will also boost the amount of spending it does for black-owned partners and increasing representation with companies the tech giant does business with. Cook also said Apple will work to boost hiring and developing underrepresented groups. The announcement comes just one week after Cook issued a statement that appeared on Apple's website, discussing\u00a0the \"painful past\" of racial discrimination that's still present today in the U.S. AS GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS CONTINUE, AMAZON AND GOOGLE PLEDGE MILLIONS TO RACIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS \"To\u00a0stand together, we must stand up for one another, and recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of\u00a0racism,\" Cook\u00a0said. Earlier this month, Cook told Apple employees the company would make donations to a \"number of groups\" and would match employee donations as well, according to a memo obtained by\u00a0Bloomberg.

Attention, shoppers: There are some big changes planned for your grocery aisles. A number of well-known food brands have recently announced their intentions to change or review their names, logos and packaging \u2014 or all three \u2014 in response to criticism concerning racial stereotyping and insensitive cultural depictions. Calls for these companies to rebrand the offending products aren\u2019t entirely new. But following the Memorial Day death of George Floyd in police custody, as well as the subsequent protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, some of the world\u2019s largest food and beverage companies have been forced to reexamine products with problematic pasts. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER (iStock) Earlier this year, and before the majority of the brands on this list announced plans to rebrand, Land O\u2019 Lakes publicly unveiled a new design for its packaging that omitted the imagery of a Native American woman, named Mia, which had long been seen on its products. A press release touting the new packaging, however, made no specific mention of removing the woman\u2019s depiction. In mid-June, Aunt Jemima became the first of several brands to rethink its packaging and marketing. \u201cWe recognize Aunt Jemima\u2019s origins are based on a racial stereotype,\" said Kristin Kroepfl, vice president and chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods North America, which markets Aunt Jemima products. (Quaker Foods itself is wholly owned by PepsiCo.) \u201cAs we work to make progress toward racial equality through several initiatives, we also must take a hard look at our portfolio of brands and ensure they reflect our values and meet our consumers\u2019 expectations.\" Quaker Foods North American further confirmed that the brand would be removing its image and changing its name in the near future. \u201cWe acknowledge the brand has not progressed enough to appropriately reflect the confidence, warmth and dignity that we would like it to stand for today,\u201d Kroepfl said. Mars Inc. has not announced a time frame for the evolution of its Uncle Ben\u2019s brand. (iStock) Mars Inc., which owns Uncle Ben\u2019s, said it would be updating the \u201cvisual identity\u201d of the brand, writing in a statement that the company has \u201ca responsibility to take a stand in helping to put an end to racial bias and injustices.\u201d \"As we listen to the voices of consumers, especially in the Black community, and to the voices of our Associates worldwide, we recognize that now is the right time to evolve the Uncle Ben\u2019s brand, including its visual brand identity, which we will do.\u201d Mars Inc. has not announced a time frame for the evolution of its Uncle Ben\u2019s brand.

An email from a Missouri woman has prompted Merriam-Webster to update its definition of \"racism\" to include the systemic aspects that have contributed to discrimination, according to a report. Kennedy Mitchum, 22, of Florissant, told KMOV-TV that she was inspired to email the dictionary publisher after getting into arguments with others about the definition. Merriam-Webster defines racism as \"a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.\" Mitchum, a recent graduate of Drake University, felt the definition was too simple and too surface-level, according to the news station. TIM COOK SAYS APPLE MUST DO MORE TO COMBAT RACISM \"So, a couple [sic] weeks ago, I said this is the last argument I'm going to have about this,\" she said.\u00a0\"I know what racism is, I've experienced it time and time and time again in a lot of different ways, so enough is enough. So, I emailed them about how I felt about it. Saying this needs to change.\" \u201cI basically told them they need to include that there is systematic oppression on people. It's not just 'I don't like someone,' it's a system of oppression for a certain group of people,\" she added. The change comes as the United States is grappling with nationwide protests over racial discrimination following the death of George Floyd. Whereas the original definition of racism\u00a0is a person's individual belief in the superiority of one race over another, the second definition will be expanded to include the types of bias that have contributed to racial discrimination, said\u00a0Peter Sokolowski, the editor-at-large at Merriam-Webster, in a statement to Fox News. \"Our second definition is divided to express, first, explicit institutional bias against people because of their race, and, second, a broader implicit bias that can also result in an asymmetrical power structure,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This second definition covers the sense that Ms. Mitchum was seeking, and we will make that even more clear in our next release,\" he added. \"This is the kind of continuous revision that is part of the work of keeping the dictionary up to date, based on rigorous criteria and research we employ in order to describe the language as it is actually used. \"",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court nominee responds to Democratic VP nominee during day three of confirmation hearings. Over the past several weeks, I have been flooded with calls, text messages and emails from Delawareans asking a simple question: Why is the Senate rushing to confirm President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, but not doing anything to help millions of American families get through the COVID-19 pandemic? It\u2019s an understandable question, and I\u2019ve been asking my Senate Republican colleagues the same thing. I will be voting against Judge Barrett\u2019s confirmation, as I told her in questioning on Wednesday. I\u2019m doing this both because we need to be focusing on COVID-19 relief and because Judge Barrett has shown through her writings that she has an activist judicial philosophy that will put at risk crucial rights and protections we all hold dear. The pandemic \u2014 the worst to hit our nation in over 100 years \u2014 has tragically claimed the lives of more than 215,000 Americans, and the death toll continues rising by the hundreds or more every day. More than 7.8 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19 and now have a new preexisting health condition. HARRIS ASKS BARRETT IF COVID-19 IS INFECTIOUS AND IF SMOKING CAUSES CANCER TO MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE POINT On top of this, more than 25 million Americans are out of a job through no fault of their own. Businesses across the country are struggling to avoid shutting down permanently, and families are in dire straits \u2014 many unable to pay their bills, rent and mortgages. The Senate should be working day and night to help these families and businesses \u2014 not proceeding with this confirmation process. Rushing to confirm Judge Barrett\u2019s nomination for a lifetime appointment on our nation\u2019s highest court directly violates the precedent that my Republican colleagues set themselves in 2016: that we should not confirm a Supreme Court justice during an election year. Today, millions of Americans have already voted in more than half our states and we\u2019re less than three weeks from Election Day. Given that my Republican colleagues appear determined to rush this process forward, the American people deserve to know the harmful real-world consequences Judge Barrett\u2019s confirmation could have on their lives. Just one week after the election, the Supreme Court will hear a case in which the Trump administration and Republican attorneys general across the country are trying to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the law that expanded health coverage and gave preexisting condition protections to more than 100 million Americans. Judge Barrett has publicly criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s previous decisions upholding the law. That\u2019s one of the main reasons why President Trump and my Republican colleagues are rushing to have her confirmed in time to hear the administration\u2019s challenge to the ACA: so she can vote to overturn the law once and for all. The consequences of such a Supreme Court ruling would be tragic. In the middle of a public health crisis, more than 23 million Americans could lose the coverage they obtain on the health insurance exchanges or through the Medicaid expansion. More than 100 million could lose preexisting condition protections. Most Americans with private health insurance coverage \u2014 including from their employers \u2014 could see prohibitions on annual and lifetime coverage caps evaporate. But it\u2019s not just the ACA that\u2019s at stake. Judge Barrett has said that she shares the judicial philosophy of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. Justice Scalia had deeply regressive views of the law. He was the sole dissenter in the case that struck down the Virginia Military Institute\u2019s male-only admissions policy and helped pave the way for the fight against gender discrimination across the board. He dissented in cases that secured rights for same-sex couples, for workers, for Native Americans, for the incarcerated, and for consumers. Justice Scalia even sought to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona, which requires law enforcement to read people their rights upon arrest. Not only does Judge Barrett share Justice Scalia\u2019s originalist philosophy; her writings indicate that she would overturn longstanding precedents that conflict with it. Throughout her career, Judge Barrett has endorsed a legal philosophy that argues that Supreme Court justices should simply overturn precedent with which they disagree. This means that many of the rights the American people think of as established and part of who we are as a country \u2014 like the right to privacy or the right to marry whomever they love \u2014 would be in danger of being taken away. In fact, after reviewing her record and writings over the past few weeks, I believe Judge Barrett has a radical judicial approach, even more conservative than Justice Scalia. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER To fully understand the extent of how a Justice Barrett could impact Americans\u2019 lives, we need only to look at the more than 120 cases that were decided by a 5-4 vote with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the majority and Justice Scalia in the dissent. If Judge Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Ginsburg\u2019s death, the rulings in all these cases hang in the balance. These 5-4 decisions aren\u2019t obscure or trivial. They are landmark cases like NFIB v. Sebelius, which upheld the ACA; and Obergefell v. Hodges, which made marriage equality the law of the land. The cases also include Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld the University of Michigan\u2019s efforts to ensure racial diversity in admissions; Miller v. Alabama, which prevents states from sentencing juveniles to mandatory life imprisonment; and Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With the confirmation of a Justice Barrett, a Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority would be like nothing we have seen in many decades. It would, I fear, usher in a new chapter of conservative judicial activism that would disrupt rights that we hold dear across so many aspects of our lives. I worry that the consequences of the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court would be devastating for the American people and for our nation for many years to come.

The funeral for late congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis will take place at 11 a.m. Thursday at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Ga. -- the church where Martin Luther King, Jr., was baptized\u00a0and served as a pastor and where his funeral was held after his 1968 assassination. Lewis, D-Ga., this week was lying in state at the U.S. Capitol for three days as part of a six-day celebration of his life planned by his family. The celebration\u00a0included a processional over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where he was beaten in 1965 as he led a group marching from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery, Ala., protesting obstacles to Black peoples' right to vote. Lewis also\u00a0was honored at the Alabama state Capitol and his casket was driven past\u00a0the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., where he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington -- the event where King, Jr., made his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.

(AP Photo/File) JOHN LEWIS, CIVIL RIGHTS ICON, CONGRESSMAN FOR 33 YEARS, DEAD AT 80 When Lewis was 15, he heard King\u2019s sermons on WRMA, a radio station in Montgomery, Ala., he recalled in an interview for the Southern Oral History Program. King was \u201cthe person who, more than any other, continued to influence my life, who made me who I was,\u201d Lewis wrote in his 1998 autobiography, \u201cWalking with the Wind.\" Three former American presidents will be at Lewis' funeral Thursday, with George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first Black president in American history, set to speak. Lewis was the son of Alabama sharecroppers and engaged in decades of activism before being elected to Congress in 1987 and living to see Obama's inauguration\u00a0in 2009. \"When we were organizing voter-registration drives, going on the Freedom Rides, sitting in, coming here to Washington for the first time, getting arrested, going to jail, being beaten, I never thought \u2014 I never dreamed \u2014 of the possibility that an African American would one day be elected president of the United States,\u201d Lewis wrote shortly before Obama assumed office. Lewis by 1963 had been arrested no fewer than 24 times while protesting, and by the end of his career had been arrested more than 40 times. He liked to talk about getting into \"good trouble.\" In this Feb. 15, 2011, file photo, President Barack Obama presents a 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to U.S. Rep.

According to its website, South-View Cemetery was founded after the end of the Civil War by former slaves and inters the bodies of more than 80,000 African Americans. King, Jr., and Dr. Benjamin Mays, another high-profile civil rights leader, were both initially buried at South-View before being moved, the South-View website says.\u00a0And Lt. Henry O. Flipper, the \"Buffalo Soldier\" who was the first Black man to graduate from West Point, was also at South-View for a time before his military honors were posthumously returned and he was moved to a military cemetery.\u00a0According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Martin Luther King Sr., is still buried at South-View.

            "article_content": "In 2019, the longtime Democratic congressman and civil rights icon announced he was undergoing treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. John Lewis saw the line of Alabama state troopers a few hundred yards away as he led hundreds of marchers to the apex of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965. Armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, the troopers were flanked by horse-riding members of the sheriff\u2019s posse. A crowd of whites milled around nearby. Lewis, who died Friday at age 80, was just 25 at the time. He had been leading voting rights demonstrations for months in the notoriously racist town, and he and the others were trying to take a message of freedom to segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace in Montgomery. So, rather than stopping, Lewis put another foot forward. That seminal step propelled him on to a global stage as a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. The ensuing confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. JOHN LEWIS, CIVIL RIGHTS ICON, CONGRESSMAN FOR 33 YEARS, DEAD AT 80 In this March 7, 1965, file photo, a state trooper swings a billy club at John Lewis, right foreground, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, to break up a civil rights voting march in Selma, Ala. Lewis sustained a fractured skull. Lewis, who carried the struggle against racial discrimination from Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress, died Friday, July 17, 2020. (AP) With fellow civil rights activist Hosea Williams at his side, Lewis finally stopped a few feet away from the phalanx of troopers commanded by Maj. John Cloud of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Other marchers stopped behind them, shifting their feet uncomfortably on the bridge shoulder. Williams asked Cloud whether they could talk. There would be none of that, said Cloud. Acting on Wallace\u2019s order, he said the march was illegal and gave the group two minutes to leave. Seconds later, Cloud unleashed a spasm of state-sanctioned violence that shocked the nation for its sheer brutality. \u201cTroopers, here, advance toward the group. See that they disperse,\u201d he said through a bullhorn. Lewis stood motionless with his hands in the pockets of his raincoat, a knapsack on his back. Archival film footage and photos show a line of roughly two dozen troopers wearing gas masks as they approach the long, peaceful line led by Lewis. A trooper jabbed the butt of a nightstick toward Lewis and officers quickly pushed into the group. Feet became tangled and bodies hit both the grass roadside and the asphalt road. Screams rang out. In this March 17, 1965, file photo, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., fourth from left, foreground, locks arms with his aides as he leads a march of several thousands to the courthouse in Montgomery, Ala. From left are: an unidentified woman, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, James Foreman, King, Jesse Douglas Sr., and John Lewis. Lewis, who carried the struggle against racial discrimination from Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress, died Friday, July 17, 2020. (AP) Lewis, in sworn court testimony five days later before U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., recalled being knocked to the ground. A state trooper standing upright hit him once in the head with a nightstick; Lewis shielded his head with a hand. The trooper hit Lewis again as he tried to get up. The officer was never publicly identified; Lewis testified he didn\u2019t know who it was, and a gas mask shielded the man's identity. Others were beaten even worse as whites cheered from nearby. Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was in the line behind Lewis, was tear-gassed and beaten so badly she had to be carried away unconscious. Others were clubbed by the sheriff\u2019s posse members on horseback. TRIBUTES POUR IN FOR CIVIL RIGHTS ICON AND US REP. JOHN LEWIS: 'WE HAVE LOST A GIANT' Lewis testified he never lost consciousness, but he also didn\u2019t remember how he got back to a church where he was taken before being admitted to a hospital. He got out in time for a hearing before Johnson, who overturned Wallace\u2019s order and ruled demonstrators could march to Montgomery. Lewis was just a few feet away from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the front of more than 3,000 marchers when they left Selma on March 21, 1965, for the epic 52-mile walk to Montgomery. Wallace, who had vowed \u201csegregation forever\u201d during his 1963 inaugural and served four terms as governor, refused to meet with them. Lewis outlived other key players in what came to be known as Bloody Sunday by many years. He addressed a throng atop the bridge in March, after his cancer diagnosis, to mark the 55th commemoration of the day. \u201cSpeak up, speak out, get in the way,\u201d said Lewis, who appeared frail but spoke in a strong voice. \u201cGet in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.\u201d Wallace died in 1998, five years after Cloud, and Judge Johnson died in 1999. Hosea Williams, the other march leader who was beside Lewis that day on the bridge, died in 2000. Robinson, who recovered from her injuries and crossed the Selma bridge with Lewis and then-President Barack Obama during the 50th anniversary commemoration, died in 2015.",

Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...Philadelphia mayor warns residents mail-in ballot count may take days to completePhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, warned residents in his city that counting the mail-in ballots \u201cwill easily take several days\u201d after Election Day, which increases the possibility that it could be a while before the election is settled. Pennsylvania has been seen as one of the most pivotal states in the election. President Trump hopes to attract a massive surge in voters from outside Philadelphia and its suburbs in order to offset the highly Democrat city. Kenney\u2019s announcement could open the possibility that Trump opens up a massive lead going into Nov. 4, but could see that advantage evaporate as the vote from the city gets tallied. Nate Silver, the pollster, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he thinks the 2020 election will come down to\u00a0 Pennsylvania.\u201cPennsylvania has not bumped up to a seven or eight-point Biden lead, like we see in Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d he said. Biden leads Trump by 4.9% in Pennsylvania, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s updating average of 2020 presidential general election polls, compared to a more sizeable lead of 8.4% in Michigan and 8.6% in Wisconsin. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Philadelphia has already received 400,000 mail-in ballots and pointed out that three-quarters of the voters there are registered Democrats. They noted that the city could very well determine who wins the state.

            "article_content": " America lost a courageous pioneer of the civil rights movement who repeatedly risked his life to fight against racism and for justice and equality with the death Friday of Rep. John Lewis. Lewis was also a master legislator in Congress and a visionary who changed the course of history for the better, and a man I was blessed to have met many times. Lewis was brutally beaten, unjustly jailed and almost killed in the struggle to end segregation in the Jim Crow South and win the right to vote for Black Americans. He literally shed his blood to give African Americans in my generation opportunities he never had growing up. We all owe him a personal debt of gratitude we can never repay. It was my honor to have known John Lewis. On the many occasions I met him, and always shook his hand or embraced him, I was humbled by his sacrifice and the continuing fight he waged for a more perfect union. He greeted everyone in the halls of Congress and at civic events with a smile. He was never too busy to take a picture. And he always had time to hug you. US REP. JOHN LEWIS, CIVIL RIGHTS ICON, DEAD AT 80 From humble beginnings in Troy, Miss., on a farm with no electricity or indoor plumbing, Lewis blazed a trail for all fighters for human rights to follow, and for all Americans to strive toward. He was a role model not just for Black Americans but for good people the world over who reject hatred and bigotry, and who believe that we are indeed all created equal. Known fondly as \u201cthe conscience of Congress,\u201d Lewis always believed that America's best days were ahead and not in the past. That was why he put his body on the line for civil rights and the right to vote. He remained nonviolent, even though he was beaten over 40 times and arrested 24 times in the struggle for equal justice. Lewis was mighty in his convictions. Deep in his heart, he believed that every American should have the right to vote, understanding that this was the only way to get politicians to support the just and noble cause of equality. Lewis knew the right to vote was the lynchpin to our democracy, and shouldn't be obstructed by long lines, poll taxes, or any other stumbling block. This belief was a touchstone of Lewis's life. And this belief kept him fighting with every ounce of his strength until his final day, when pancreatic cancer claimed his life at age 80. He understood that despite the tremendous progress Black Americans have made, the truth is that far too many Americans still experience voter suppression in their quest to cast their ballots and record their voice in this democracy. Lewis almost lost his life in the struggle for voting rights in March 1965. As a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he was part of a multiyear campaign to deliver the right to vote to African Americans in Alabama and throughout the United States. As Lewis and a group of committed, unarmed and nonviolent civil rights activists began their first march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama they were met on the Edmund Pettus Bridge by a wall of Alabama state troopers. Seconds later, the troopers began shoving Lewis and fellow protesters, tossing many to the ground, beating them brutally with billy clubs wrapped in barbed wire. Lewis suffered a broken skull in the unprovoked police attack. Knocked to the ground, Lewis tried to get up, only to have the trooper viscously club him again. John Lewis stands out in American history as a leader and role model for us all to emulate. Police also fired tear gas at the peaceful demonstrators and some officers even charged the crowd on horseback. This horrifying event became known as Bloody Sunday and shocked the conscience of the nation when TV newscasts broadcast the racist attack. Just eight days later, President Lyndon Johnson presented the Voting Rights Act to Congress and he signed it into law in August after it was passed by both houses. Lewis spent a good chunk of his professional life protecting the Voting Rights Act while he served in the House, representing Georgia since his first election as a Democrat in 1986. He was known for fiery floor speeches and brilliant legislative tactics to protect the right to vote on Capitol Hill. Regrettably, in 2013 a Supreme Court ruling gutted two critical provisions in the Voting Rights Act. That led Lewis to wage a new campaign to protect voting rights, inspiring a new generation of civil rights activists. Whether it be the egregious voter suppression that took place in Georgia's gubernatorial race in 2018, or the continued attempts by Republicans to close polling places in predominantly Black communities, John Lewis was in the struggle. You could always count on him to stand up for the disenfranchised, the victims of discrimination, and those pushed aside. He was always ready to create what he called \u201cgood trouble.\u201d In an op-ed written after that Supreme Court ruling that weakened the Voting Rights Act, Lewis said that \"the right to vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy. I risked my life defending that right. Some died in the struggle. If we are ever to actualize the true meaning of equality, effective measures such as the Voting Rights Act are still a necessary requirement of democracy.\" Lewis loved America, so much so that he risked his life to make it a better place. And as he goes on to heaven, he does so when his beloved democracy is in chaos. Not only has COVID-19 laid bare many of health care inequities that Lewis fought to change. The deaths of so many unarmed Black people at the hands of police and reemergence of outright voter suppression against Black communities shows that the evil of racism has not been eradicated. After watching the brutal murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day, Lewis told the \u201cCBS Morning News\u201d: \u201cIt was so painful, it made me cry.\u201d And he added: \u201cPeople now understand what the struggle was all about.\u201d Lewis believed sincerely that Black Lives Matter and his entire life was steeped in that truth. At just 23 he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and spent every day afterward working to make the ideals of that march a reality. If not for John Lewis' activism, I doubt that my own Jamaican family would have made it to America's shores. If not for Lewis' quiet bravery, I probably wouldn't be a Fox News commentator and might not even be allowed to vote. He changed America for the better in more ways than we can count. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER John Lewis stands out in American history as a leader and role model for us all to emulate. He was a true believer in the \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d that we say we believe in when we recite the Pledge of Allegiance. And while Lewis is sadly no longer with us, we must embody his legacy and use it as a tool to make America a better, stronger and more equitable society. We must begin to see the legacy of John Lewis in the Black Lives Matter nonviolent protesters, putting their bodies on the line to affirm the value of Black lives in the face of an unbalanced and out-of-whack criminal justice system. We must see the legacy of John Lewis in the halls of Congress, and fight to pass the new version of the Voting Rights Act so no American will ever have to wait in a long line or be subjected to Jim Crow-like voter suppression tactics. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And most importantly, we must see the legacy of John Lewis in neighbors and community members and understand we all deserve equality, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, no matter our creed, color or citizenship status. Lewis was a true believer in the power of love. Now he rests with angels, where there is no more pain or suffering. My prayer is that we, as a nation, will live up to the high expectations set by John Lewis' life, work and legacy. We were all blessed to have had him on this Earth for 80 years, and we are now all poorer with him no longer able to fight the righteous fight to make America a more just nation.

            "article_content": "UCLA suspended and launched a racial discrimination investigation into Gordon Klein after he refused to move or alter final exams for African-American students in the wake of George Floyd's death. A UCLA\u00a0accounting professor who was suspended by the university\u00a0after he refused a request to modify final exams in the wake of George Floyd's death\u00a0told\u00a0\"The Ingraham Angle\" Wednesday that he was following school policy. \"I got a directive, as did my colleagues, that we should absolutely continue the traditional policy [of]\u00a0the university, and give the exam as scheduled with only the normal excuses, such as you're in a car accident, you had a death in the family,\" Gordon Klein\u00a0told host Laura Ingraham. \"I followed the specific direction my boss gave me and the school knows it.\" IVANKA TRUMP RIPS \u2018CANCEL CULTURE\u2019 AFTER SHE\u2019S DROPPED AS COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER The Washington Free Beacon\u00a0reported that UCLA suspended Klein, who has taught at\u00a0the Anderson School of Management\u00a0for 39 years, for three weeks effective June 25. According to Inside Higher Ed, the students \u2013\u00ad\u00a0who described themselves as \"nonblack allies\" \u2013\u00ad\u00a0asked Klein to make the final exam\u00a0\"no-harm,\" meaning it could only boost students' grades. They also requested that he\u00a0extend the deadlines for final assignments and projects. In an email to students Monday, the school's Dean Antonio Bernardo called Klein's behavior \"troubling\" and\u00a0extended the time students have to complete exams given the \"difficult circumstances.\" Ingraham asked Klein to react to a Change.org petition demanding his\u00a0firing that has been\u00a0 signed by 20,000 students. She also asked if he believed he was \"singled out.\" \"I can leave it to others to figure out why I was\u00a0the one who was chastised for the action,\" Klein responded.\u00a0\"In my case, I've been there 39 years. I've always been outspoken as an advocate of equal treatment of all students. I've always been noted for compassion. But I'm somebody who's on the verge of retirement. \"The best I can figure out, they needed the sacrificial lamb,\" he added.\u00a0\"That's what my colleagues have told me. And I was [easy] to sacrifice when they're weighing the principle of standing on equality of treatment for all students\u00a0irrespective of color versus trying to placate the angry mob. It was easy for them, at least they believe it\u00a0was easy for them, to simply jettison me.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Klein described the university's action as \"a sad day for free inquiry.\" \"I cited in my email [response] my belief in Martin Luther King's principles. I called Minnesota a tragedy. And the student himself who contacted me thanked me for getting them through troubling times, thanked me for sending them anti-racist materials,\" he said. \"The school simply doesn't care. They want to placate the angry mob. \"And it's a tragedy for the future of education because historically, the faculty code of conduct [says]\u00a0You must not have a choice. You must grade people based on merit. The school is disregarding its own policies in favor of the squeaky wheel, those who threaten to riot.\" Fox News' Caleb Parke contributed to this report.",

However, Jennings\u2019 departure is said to have come after an investigation into her social media posts. Earlier this week, Twitter users called out the carrier for the flight attendant\u2019s \u201chateful, racist rhetoric\u201d and accused her of attacking the Black Lives Matter movement with her inflammatory posts. Though Jennings\u2019 Twitter account appears to have since been made private, purported screenshots of older, offensive tweets have surfaced on the platform this week, as commenters demanded that she be fired from Delta. According to the outlet, Jennings often represented Delta at company events and even won an esteemed Chairman\u2019s Club award last year.

NEW YORK\u00a0\u2014 The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has established a fund worth more than $12 million to aid organizations fighting institutional racism, in the wake of the George Floyd protests. On Wednesday, the foundation, which has been influential in the emergence of the broader Black Lives Matter movement, said it was setting aside $6 million in donations to support black-led grassroots organizing groups. Last week, it\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a separate $6.5 million fund for its network of affiliate chapters. Beginning July 1, affiliated chapters can apply for unrestricted funding of up to $500,000 in multi-year grants, the foundation announced. Grants from both funds will be administered through a fiscal sponsor, said Kailee Scales, managing director of the foundation.TUCKER CARLSON: BLACK LIVES MATTER IS WORKING TO REMAKE AND CONTROL THE COUNTRY - AND IS IMMUNE FROM CRITICISM \u201cIn this watershed moment for black power building ... it is critical that we democratize giving to ensure all of us have access to the resources we need to reverse centuries of disinvestment in black communities, and invest in a future where we can all be connected, represented and free,\u201d Scales said in a statement to The Associated Press. According to the network\u2019s website, the organization has more than a dozen active chapters, including Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Detroit, as well as in Canada. Its newest chapter is in South Bend, Indiana. The foundation told the AP it has received more than 1.1 million individual donations at an average of $33 per gift since the death of Floyd, a black man who died May 25 pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer held a knee to his neck for nearly eight minutes. The surge of financial support adds to roughly $3.4 million in net assets the BLM Global Network had on hand last year, according to a\u00a02019 financial statement\u00a0of Thousand Currents, the fiscal sponsor which receives donations on the network\u2019s behalf and then releases money to the group.

Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the group behind the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, has established a more than $12 million fund to aid organizations fighting institutional racism in the wake of the George Floyd protests. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Creation of the funds signals a growth in infrastructure for the network, which had been at odds with some local chapter organizers, who felt network leaders weren\u2019t providing enough financial support for initiatives such as rapid response to police brutality. Although there are many groups that use \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cBLM\u201d in their names, only 16 are considered affiliates of the global network. For Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, the network\u2019s first official chapter, the fund will increase its capacity to support families in need of legal aid, public communications strategy and other services after a loved one is killed by police, said organizer Melina Abdullah, who is a professor in the Pan-African Studies department at California State University, Los Angeles. We\u2019ve been struggling for seven years now with very limited resources. We\u2019re not paid. But we also have real costs, even if we\u2019re not taking salaries.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling for seven years now with very limited resources,\u201d Abdullah told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019re not paid. But we also have real costs, even if we\u2019re not taking salaries.\u201d Renewed energy in the BLM movement has created a need for more resources, she added. \u201cThis fund will allow us to move forward in really strong ways.\u201dCORNELL PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED BLACK LIVES MATTER FACES STUDENT BOYCOTT Racial justice groups across the U.S. have reported receiving tens of millions of dollars in donations, particularly for community bail funds posting bond for protesters arrested in demonstrations. The wealth is being spread across younger grassroots organizations and legacy institutions, such as the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Urban League. The Black Lives Matter movement emerged in 2013 amid anger over the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. The network of chapters was formed in 2014, following what organizers called Ferguson October, a national mobilization in response to the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the work we\u2019ve been able to do in the last seven years,\u201d Patrisse Cullors, co-founder and chairwoman of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cWhat is clear is that Black Lives Matter shares a name with a much larger movement and there are literally hundreds of organizations that do impactful racial and gender justice work who make up the fabric of this broader movement.\u201d The foundation has already identified several movement organizations that it would like to support, said Cullors, who declined to name the groups. The foundation says it will \u201cprioritize mutual aid organizations, direct service and organizations focused on creating sustainable improvements in the material conditions for all black people.\u201d It also looks to support black lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-led groups.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Over its nearly six years of existence, the BLM Global Network had received contributions from high-profile donors, including A-list entertainers such as Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and Prince, who contributed to BLM mere weeks before his death in 2016. But unanswered questions of transparency and access to those gifts left some organizers in network affiliate chapters frustrated. In January 2018, a New York City chapter announced its decision to leave the BLM Global Network, citing the need for autonomy to better serve its community. In December 2019, a different group of organizers in New York rejoined the network, Scales said. In recent weeks, the BLM Global Network has had to\u00a0debunk\u00a0misinformation from conservative activists who claimed the group\u2019s donations were being redirected to the Democratic Party. The network has also been in a tug of war with a California-based organization called the \u201cBlack Lives Matter Foundation,\u201d which has accepted donations that do not support the movement. The other group\u00a0reportedly\u00a0raised millions of dollars in recent weeks from small individual gifts and from employees of large corporations, such as Apple and Microsoft, who believed they were supporting the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.",

After Monday, October 26, President Donald Trump\u2019s most profound effect on the Constitution may no longer be his fight against the Russia collusion probe or his acquittal for impeachment. As I argue in my book \u201cDefender-in-Chief,\u201d Trump not only raised the Constitution as a shield against assaults on the legitimacy of his presidency. In both cases, he also defended the Founders\u2019 vision of the executive branch \u2013 one that vests the power to enforce the law and protect the national security in the hands of a single, elected president \u2013 against the progressive idea of government as the preserve of unelected experts who should wield their professional judgment free from political control. But now, Trump has had a more direct impact on our political future by appointing Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.\u00a0It will not be, as Democrats fear and Republicans hope, due to her immediate influence on urgent issues such as the constitutionality of ObamaCare and 2020 election disputes arising out of battleground states.\u00a0These questions will fade. CLARENCE THOMAS TO ADMINISTER CONSTITUTIONAL OATH TO AMY CONEY BARRETT Texas v. California, which the Justices will hear the second week of November, presents a technical legal issue (severability) with minor importance in the constitutional scheme of things. Even if the Court strikes down ObamaCare\u2019s mandate that everyone buy health insurance, the law\u2019s larger elements, such as vast new federal spending and intensive regulation of the health care industry, will remain. Election cases may seem more imperative.\u00a0So far, the Supreme Court has placed a light hand on the shenanigans in the battleground states. It has passed twice on reviewing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s use of the coronavirus emergency to arbitrarily change the date by which mail-in ballots must arrive and how officials are to verify them. While the Court has passively sat by due to Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 choice to vote with the three liberal Justices (Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) to block review, it cannot avoid the important constitutional question for long. Article I of the Constitution specifically vests in the state legislatures the right to set the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner of holding Elections\u201d and Article II gives the state legislatures alone the right to decide how to appoint presidential electors. With Justice Barrett breaking the 4-4 tie, the Court can address whether the interference of judges in Pennsylvania and her sister states, even under the guise of an emergency, violates the state legislatures\u2019 control over the presidential election. Nevertheless, these election cases will matter this year but perhaps no farther.\u00a0 They arise only when the American people cannot make up their minds and elections are so close. In good health, Justice Barrett may sit on the Supreme Court in the year 2050, when the elections of 2016 and 2020 fade from memory. BLUMENTHAL IN SENATE FLOOR SPEECH WARNS OF 'CONSEQUENCES' IF BARRETT CONFIRMED Few today are fighting over (or even remember) whether third-party candidate Ross Perot entered the 1992 and 1996 races out of spite and thereby threw both elections to Bill Clinton. Instead, Barrett will have the far more profound influence of addressing controversies that have divided our politics for decades and perhaps even beginning to settle fundamental questions that may provide a structure for the future. The obvious issue surrounding Barrett\u2019s nomination, and that of every Supreme Court nominee since Robert Bork in 1987, is abortion. Abortion has driven the escalation of politics because it removed one of the nation\u2019s most important social questions from the arena of elections and legislatures and transferred it to the docket of the Supreme Court. Voters who care about abortion can now change policy only by influencing the judges on the federal courts. Overturning Roe v. Wade would not only reverse a poorly reasoned decision, but it could set the nation on a better course. Reversing Roe v. Wade would not end abortion in the nation, but only return the question to Congress and the nation\u2019s statehouses. States could choose different abortion regimes, just as they do with crime and other life and death questions, and people can move to live in states whose policies they like. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Barrett may prove just as important in finding a path forward for the future.\u00a0 Perhaps the greatest conflict besetting the Court today is the conflict between liberty and equality. Our Bill of Rights recognizes the right of individuals to freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion, among others.\u00a0 These rights have steadily come into conflict with the efforts of state and local governments to extend equality beyond race, gender, and religion to new categories such as sexual orientation and the transgender. Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (there goes Pennsylvania again, causing trouble at the Supreme Court), to be argued November 4, illustrates the conflict of ideals.\u00a0 Philadelphia prohibited Catholic Social Services from providing foster homes for orphaned, abused, or neglected children because it would not place children with gay couples \u2013 contrary to the city\u2019s non-discrimination policy. Justice Barrett could provide a fifth or even sixth vote on the Court to recognizing that the Bill of Rights fundamental protections for liberty supersede more recent, popular efforts to mandate equality. If she were to demand that the courts protect the right of speech and religion above all, Barrett would make her most profound contribution to the Supreme Court and the Constitution. Many conservatives overcame their wariness toward Trump four years ago when he released his list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Unlike Republican presidents past, Trump did not include stealth nominees on the order of David Souter or Anthony Kennedy, who became critical votes to discover rights to abortion or gay marriage in the Constitution. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In nominating Barrett to the Supreme Court, he kept his promise by choosing an undaunted originalist \u2013 someone who interprets the Constitution based on the understanding held by its ratifiers. Trump\u2019s most profound effect on the Constitution will come when she and the other Trump Justices apply that originalism to the questions of liberty and equality.

JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to the special edition of \"Hannity\": The Road to 2020 -- just 102 days left until election night. I'm Jason Chaffetz, in tonight for Sean. And for the hour, we'll show how the Democratic Party plans to radically transform this country into a far-left utopia. We start in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders hate Trump so much that they are willing to let their own city burn in order to prove just how woke they really are. The Portland riots are now on night 58 with no end in sight, but Mayor Ted Wheeler seems to cherish the anarchists who are destroying his city, because, of course, things are going so well, he wants federal law enforcement officers to leave town. Meanwhile, city officials demanded that the protective fencing around the federal courthouse be taken down. And Joe Biden is accusing federal officers of using, quote, \"egregious tactics\", end quote. Remember, these officers are protecting a federal courthouse that has been firebombed, vandalized, covered in graffiti and broken into on multiple occasions. As you look at these scenes, ask yourself, do you want to live in Ted Wheeler's America? Do you want to be governed by mob rule? Do you want to bend to the knee of violent extremists? Because that's what you'll get nationwide if Joe Biden is elected. Well, joining us now with more is civil rights attorney Leo Terrell and FOX News contributor Lawrence Jones. Lawrence Jones has a special \"One Nation\", about race relations in America. It airs Sunday night at 10:00 p.m. right here on the Fox News Channel. Gentlemen, thank you so much. Nationally syndicated radio host Larry Elder will be joining us -- in momentarily, he's got a radio program and he's jumping upstairs to come join us. So, he'll join us in just a moment. But, Leo, I want to start with you. This is 58 -- 58 nights of riots. Some people want to call them protests, but I think the riots. And these images are going out to America, I don't get it. Joe Biden says that, hey, these are egregious tactics by the feds, are you kidding me? LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER: Yes, you know what, I wish every Democratic mayor and Democratic governor take constitutional law class. Jason, the federal government and President Trump has the absolute right to protect federal property and enforce crimes or to prosecute people who commit federal crimes. Defacing a federal building is a crime and what's amazing is these Democratic cities are being burned. And let's not call these people protesters. And what is embarrassing, those other two Democratic cable networks, they won't show this. They are trying to hide the chaos and the extreme maker of these groups, they are not protesters, they are criminals. Joe Biden should be ashamed of himself. He used to get the endorsement of police officers union. But guess what, law and order, police officers unions are backing Donald J. Trump and, that is what American needs to know for the next 100 days. Law and order is in the Republican Party. Chaos and lawlessness, the Democratic Party. CHAFFETZ: Lawrence, I never thought I'd see the day. I don't know how a national party thinks they can win an election by being so anti-law enforcement. They want to abolish ICE and you look at these scenes right now and the mayor and the Democrats, including Joe Biden himself is saying the feds are using egregious tactics. I just don't get that. JONES: Yes. And, you know, as you know Jason, I've been on the ground reporting all these liberal cities for a while. I mean, I spent the better part of last year going to every single city talking about the death, poverty and destruction in these communities. You know, it's not just the anti-law enforcement rhetoric. It's the fact that they're willing to let the city burn. I mean, average day Americans who don't want to even care about the politics of a Democrat or Republican Party, are fearful right now, because they see what's happening into their city. And the most disgusting part about this is that, this started about -- being about George Floyd and you have a bunch of paid anarchists who are now trying to use George Floyd's death as a shield when this is nothing -- has nothing to do with them. These people have their own agenda. They're anarchists, they're paid -- they're willing to take over a zone, and the lack of accountability. You know, the people that are elected in office, they have a duty. They can pass all these other laws, but as elected officials, your first duty is to keep your residents safe and they failed on this front. My only thing is that when it comes to the Republican Party, you know, when you have these Democrats that have failed leadership, it shouldn't be that hard to defeat these guys. I hope that they present an alternative message and give these liberal cities and voters a fighting chance. CHAFFETZ: No, I think you're -- Lawrence, I think you're absolutely right. Now, I want to bring Larry into this conversation here, because, Larry, I've got to tell you, the president said he's going to solve this problem, the president has thousands of federal officers that he can come in, but you have a mayor who's saying, don't bring him in here, but a family couldn't go walk around that courthouse, this should be a place of peace and tranquility, and it should be easy for a family to walk down the street. And what business wants to operate in that type of situation? LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST: Absolutely, Jason, because you got a lot of left-wing mayors who believe the lie. And the lie is that the police are out killing black people just because they're black. Even Marc Lamont Hill conceded in an interview with Candace Owens the other day that that was not true. I mean, you have a hard-left guy conceding that the whole reason that people are out in the streets, the notion that people are killing black people just because they're black is false. And, Jason, just three days before George Floyd died, a black Mississippi cop was choking a black -- young black suspect, it didn't kill him, but my goodness. Had this been a white cop choking a young black suspect, we know both the cop's name, we know the suspect's name, which shows you that the media is selective about the cases that they care about. The bottom line is, the real problem facing young black men is other young black men. Half of the homicides in this country are black victims and they are almost always killed by another young black man. The cops are not doing this. So, the whole premise is false. You're trashing neighborhoods based on the false premise, devaluating property values and causing job diminution and job creation all based on a false notion that even Marc Lamont Hill say was false. CHAFFETZ: Now, Leo, I want to transition just slightly. I worry about the puppeteers that are controlling and feeding the information to Joe Biden. Because his quote was that the feds are using the egregious tactics. But I watched that video, I watch what's going on there and that's not what I'm seeing. Does Joe Biden even have a plan to address this and quell this violence? TERRELL: Let me think about that, it's a very tough question. No, not at all. He is being run by extremists. Listen, let me be very clear. This is why I'm here. This is why I'm on FOX campaigning against Democrats. The Democratic Party has been hijacked by Black Lives Matter. What Larry said is well-taken. You got Democratic mayors of running these cities and guess what, they yell systematic discrimination. They are minorities running the system and they are punishing their own people. And yet they play the pandering game, they play the race car. Joe Biden had the audacity to just call Donald Trump a racist. He needs to look at his record. His association with Robert Byrd and his offensive comment, that was the number one reason that drove me to the Republicans. If you don't vote for me, you ain't black. That is the most racist, offensive statement he's ever made in his life. It's ridiculous. CHAFFETZ: Lawrence, you made a really good point. Republicans should be able to organize and run successful campaign against mayors like Mayor Wheeler but the President Trump, where he finds himself right now here today. If you were advising the president, what would you say to President Trump? What should he do to quell this violence and to make the case over the next several months? JONES: I think he should hold the Republican National Committee accountable. They need to go in and give -- these are American citizens. And if you realize that one side of the aisle has filled these citizens, it is our duty to fight for life from the womb to the tomb. And the only way we can win is changing what's happening in those communities, you can't change it if you're not there. I talked to Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, all these things, and I travel every week talking to people. Do you think they care about if an R and a D is front of your name? They don't care. They want some (INAUDIBLE) going to stop the bleeding. And that means black America as well. Do you think that black America wants to defund the police? That's not what they're saying. They want equal justice under the law. They realize that there's bad apples and they want those people taken care of, but by and large, the community is saying, protect us. When the state abuses this power, they should be prosecuted but when citizens terrorize their own communities, they should be prosecuted as well. And we're going to talk about that in my special \"One Nation\" on Sunday at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. CHAFFETZ: Well, very good. Larry, I want to give you that same question, what advice would you give to the president to help quell the violence? I love that he's taking a pro-law enforcement stance, but what else can the president do? ELDER: He should also talk about the Ferguson effect. The Ferguson effect is what happens when cops unfairly -- are maligned as racists. They pulled back and the bad guys know it, and the very people that the Black Lives Matter and these other activists claim they care about are the ones who are hurt. I would also talk about Joe Biden, how he's consistently lied about his civil rights record. He claims he desegregated restaurants in Wilmington, Delaware, and theaters. No evidence whatsoever, he claims he's got support from the NAACP. The NAACP is a 501(c)(3) corporation, they can't do it. He lied and said he got arrested, visiting Nelson Mandela, all of which says that Joe Biden thinks of black people as props, as pawns, as too foolish to check out the facts. All you have to do is just tell them a bunch of lies and they pull the lever, 95 percent for people like me. And I think it's very offensive. Black people are angry at Rachel Dolezal for lying, why aren't you angry at Joe Biden for all of his lies? CHAFFETZ: Well, I don't think Joe Biden -- (CROSSTALK) ELDER: I'm angry at Joe Biden. I'm angry. I'm angry. I'm angry at Joe Biden right now, that's why I'm here. Joe Biden is fake and he's the racist. CHAFFETZ: Well, listen, I don't think he has a plan and he had eight years as the vice president of the United States with Barack Obama, and they didn't seem to get it done. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. Larry, Leo and Lawrence, thank you. And don't forget to check out Lawrence Jones special, \"One Nation\", right here on the FOX News Channel, Sunday night at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. Don't miss it. All right. Coming up, HUD secretary, Dr. Ben Carson, will join us. Plus, we'll have the very latest from Chicago where the city's far left mayor is attempting to restore order by tearing down a statue of Christopher Columbus. Don't go away, as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity.\" Now, while far left mayors like Seattle's Jenny Durkan and Chicago's Lori Lightfoot continue to resist federal support even as cities crumble, the police chief in Detroit is welcoming the needed assistance. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: But unlike other cities, you welcome the president's help? JAMES CRAIG, DETROIT POLICE CHIEF: Absolutely. We -- you know, I think there has been a lot of partisan politics involved to the support. What we do have and what we've entered into with this administration is late December, I stood with General Barr and all the heads of the DOJ and we both come (AUDIO GAP) what was called then Relentless Pursuit. So, what's going on now is just enhancement. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: And also developing tonight, the Trump administration is taking bold action to stop Democratic plans to destroy American suburbs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is scrapping the highly controversial Obama era affirmatively furthering Fair Housing Rule, which would effectively end single family zoning, upend American suburbs as we know it, and likely destroy home values in the process. But guess what? Joe Biden has already promised that he would keep the rule and if elected, it would mean an unprecedented attack on middle-class communities around the country. So, from abolish ICE, to defund the police, to now even dismantling the suburbs, the Democrats' leftist agenda is as destructive as ever, and it's all part of the vision for America that undermines every value that's made this country great, like the rule of law, economic prosperity and freedom of expression. Here to react to all of this, HUD secretary, Dr. Ben Carson. Dr. Carson, thanks so much for being with us. Mr. Secretary, you're one of our favorites here. This rule -- I don't think anybody knew what this rule was, but it could be devastating and you just repealed this. Tell us about it. DR. BEN CARSON, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY: Well, first of all, I'd like to say and I've had the pleasure of meeting Chief Craig. And it's so refreshing to see someone who really cares about the job, cares about the people who live there. You know, it was 53 years ago yesterday that the Detroit riots started. And there's -- the scars are still out there, and people should recognize that when you invite anarchists into your neighborhood and you join with them, there's going to be long lasting destruction that you're going to have to deal with. Your children and everybody else is going to have to deal with. So, really stop and think about that. You know, as far as the AFFH is concerned, it was an extraordinarily complex thing, supposedly to stop segregation. But it went much further than that and really imposed, you know, the federal government on all the municipalities and neighborhoods of the United States. It made us into the watchdog and to the zoning czars. That's not what was supposed to happen. It was supposed to be federalism. That's one of the principles upon which this country was founded, so that you have local control of what is going on. And interestingly enough, I've already started to hear people saying, well, the Trump administration is racist and they're backing away from civil rights and fair housing. What a bunch of garbage. The fact of the matter is if you look at the record, you know, we have resolved 22,933 backlog fair housing cases, left over from the previous administration. That requires a lot of work. And we've been very active, you know, in terms of helping Facebook to realize what they were doing, sort of electronic redlining and some of the other social media platforms have learned from that as well, you know, civil rights in terms of handicapped people in the city of Los Angeles. There are a whole host of things that we are pursuing very actively, so we don't need another bunch of layers of bureaucracy to tell people how they are supposed to live, where they're supposed to live. And also, the previous rule directed money away from the inner cities and from places where it really is needed the most and sent it off to the wealthy suburbs. And what we've done instead is, you know, that President Trump has brought us opportunity zones, which encourage unrealized capital gains to be invested into those neglected areas and to try to redevelop them in a holistic way, and concentrate on such things as education, which is the mechanism whereby you get people out of poverty, it doesn't where they come from. CHAFFETZ: Yes. CARSON: You get education in this country and they write their own ticket. CHAFFETZ: Yes. I know Senator Scott from South Carolina did a fabulous job with that. Mr. Secretary, I want to -- and I appreciate what you said about the police chief in Detroit. And I shudder to think what might have happened once the mayor and the governor hear that he's actually working with the Trump administration, I hope things don't change. But I want to get your last comment here about what the visuals, the things that we are seeing not only in Seattle but now in Portland, day 58 of what looks like just absolute riots. I don't know how people lived there, I don't know what business would want to relocate there and how would a family walked on the street and that type of situation? And Joe Biden is blaming Donald Trump. I mean, give me a break. CARSON: They blame Donald Trump for everything. I do have to step up and defend the mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan. He probably is not like a lot of those other mayors. But the fact of the matter is, you know, there is a contract, an unwritten contract between the local government and the people. The local government is supposed to protect the people. They're supposed to protect the businesses and their property. And when they don't do that, they are shirking their duties. And there should be consequences for that. And some people have started talking about that already. We need to do that. And I appeal to voters, look at the people that you are putting in office. Evaluate what they are getting done. Are they accomplishing things or are they not? Do -- are you one of those people who goes and looks at the ballot and say, I recognize that name and vote for that name? It could be Satan. I vote for that name. No. We have to be much more intelligent than that or we get what we deserve. CHAFFETZ: Yeah, yeah. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us this evening. We do appreciate it. CARSON: Thank you, Jason. Always good to be with you. All right. Up next, why criminals are so upset about President Trump's Operation LeGend. Pam Bondi, Brett Tolman and Gianno Caldwell will tell you, coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity.\" Breaking news from Chicago, last night, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the home of Mayor Lori Lightfoot to demand the defunding of the Chicago Police Department. This came hours after she spoke with President Trump about his plans to send federal officers to Chicago amid a surge in violence. Also new from Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot ordered the Columbus statue in Chicago's Grant Park where rioters and police clashed last Friday to be taken down. City workers arrived in the darkness of night to remove the statue. Meanwhile, Mayor De Blasio is now threatening President Trump with legal action if he sends federal officers to New York City, to help ease the growing violence in that city, saying, quote, we would immediately take action in court to stop it. Joining me now with more reaction, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, former United States Attorney Brett Tolman, and FOX News political analyst, Gianno Caldwell. Thank you so much. Gianno, whose documentary, the new battle for Chicago, gives an inside look at gang life in his hometown and is available exclusively on Fox Nation. Thank you all for joining us. I want to start with you, Brett, being a U.S. attorney, I want to talk about Operation LeGend. The left, the Democrats and mainstream media are claiming the president has no authority to do this and this is unprecedented in its nature. What's a reality? BRETT TOLMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, the reality is, is like most people in the country, we're a little fed up with what's going on in some of these cities and I can't blame the president. And is he within his right? He is 100 percent within his right and within the law to make sure that he protects the federal buildings in each of these cities. There are law enforcement officers already in these cities who have agreements with these cities to investigate and to prosecute violent crime and other issues in the cities. So, now, all of a sudden, Jason, it's like, oh, no, they are causing people to disappear and this is the Gestapo and this is, you know, unprecedented. No, it's not. For years, the federal government has been partnering to make sure that the cities are safe and he's doing it now and he's just doing what he's been doing for years and years. CHAFFETZ: Yeah, it happened in the Obama administration and the Bush administration. And, Pam, you've been the attorney general of one of our largest states in the nation. You got a Bill de Blasio who's saying if federal agents come to New York, he's going to take them to court. I mean, come on, really, it's - - Bill de Blasio, he's going to prevail on that? PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Jason, bring it on. Bring it on. President Trump is a law and order president, and he's going to maintain law and order. He's going to restore law and order to all these cities. And what Brett said is exactly right. Just think about what this way. Think about what ATF does. All these violent rioters out here with pipe bombs, with guns, with Molotov cocktails, ATF has the full authority to go after all of them. Interference with what police are doing. You got the DEA, Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals. Get ready because the U.S. -- the federal government, President Trump, our law and order president, will restore safety to all of our cities throughout this country. CHAFFETZ: Now, Gianno, you grew up in Chicago. It's a big place in your heart. The mayor is taking down a statue in the darkness of night. That's - - I mean, come on. And, you know, gets these protesters in front of her home for simply speaking with the president of the United States, what is going on there? GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: It's insanity is what it is and I'm pissed off with what we're seeing in our hometown. If you can't go to a funeral and bury your loved one in peace, what the hell can you do? I talk about it my book, \"Taken for Granted\", three years ago, Memorial Day weekend, my younger brother was in the car with two of his friends when two men walked up and shot that car 25 times. He lived thankfully but his best friend died in his arms. I am upset -- fed up with what we have seen out of Chicago. And President Trump did something in 2017. He said in a tweet, he said, if Chicago doesn't fix his carnage, he was going to send the feds. This is what he's doing. I'm glad to see the mayor of Chicago, and I give her credit for acquiescing, capitulating to President Trump's request and working with the federal government to stop the violence in the city of the Chicago because the mayor has failed. The leadership there has failed. And you need someone to come in and assist because at this point, no one is safe. If you have a 1-year-old that are being shot, senior citizens are being shot, who -- who can afford to live in a city like that? Fear is running the city and we need to stop right now. CHAFFETZ: Brett, you are talking about 1,900 shootings in Chicago, you know, over the course of time. You got, you know, 40 to 50 sometimes in a weekend, the feds have every jurisdiction to go in there and the mayor really doesn't have a choice, nor does the governor, right? TOLMAN: No, they don't. Look, I have prosecuted hundreds of firearm offenses. I was a federal prosecutor. I did it in, you know, the inner-city and it can be done now in Chicago. If the U.S. attorney's office, if the FBI, the ATF, if they decide that they are going to expend resources in this area, they can start to shut down this gun violence because there's not a question that they have legal authority to do it. CHAFFETZ: Pam, we're real quickly, we're running short on time. But it does strike me that these Democratic mayors, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, New York, I mean, they pretty much given up and given into those that are rioting and these anarchists, and just said, hey, you can do whatever you want in our city. BONDI: Yeah, Jason, they sure have. They have chosen politics over people, over the citizens of where they live which is outrageous but President Trump does not want to do that. He's going to come in and protect the citizens even if the mayors aren't. And law enforcement, they want him there. They want the help of our federal government, all working together like we always have. This doesn't happen in Florida because we work together. CHAFFETZ: Gianno, Chicago, what's your message to the president? What would you like him to continue to do? Real quick. CALDWELL: I want the president to do exactly what he's doing. He's going in, sending in federal resources. We talk about solutions, I'm been talking about this on my Instagram, @GiannoCaldwell. We have to have the solutions. It's a multi-prong. It's not just law- enforcement. It's actually a programmatic effort. Education, we got to bring back the family structure, and the president is providing those resources so we can do that. CHAFFETZ: Gianno, well-said. And you're the best at plugging your own stuff I've ever seen, well done. (LAUGHTER) CALDWELL: OK. CHAFFETZ: All right. Pam, Brett, Gianno, thank you. Coming up, an update from the anti-Trump media and the cancel culture world. Stay tuned. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity.\" Also breaking tonight, Covington High School graduate Nicholas Sandmann announced he has settled with \"The Washington Post\" in a defamation suit stemming from their botched coverage of his interaction with the Native American elder last year that falsely portrayed him as a aggressor. If you recall, media outlets smear the teenager and misreported what actually happened. Now, following the news, Sandmann tweeted: We have settled with \"The Washington Post\" and CNN. The fight isn't over. Two down, six to go. So, ask yourself, how far will the media, Joe Biden supporters and the radical Democrats go to try to smear the president and his allies? Censorship, cancel culture and intimidation are all now part of the Democratic playbook. Just look at this new poll from the Cato Institute finding that 62 percent of Americans say they have political views they're afraid to share. Now, yesterday, the president sat down with Barstools Sports' Dave Portnoy and discussed these deeply polarized items. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVE PORTNOY, BARSTOOLS SPORTS: Half the country hates the other half, and no matter what you say, you can't get along. So, you are the lightning rod, there's no doubt about that. In my mind, do you agree with that, that you're like the lightning rod? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sometimes for a purpose. I mean, you know -- PORTNOY: How do we bring it together? So the two sides right now that are at head, can be like, you're my guy? TRUMP: I think it was happening and then we got hit by the China virus. Our country never did better. The highest -- the best employment numbers in the history of our country, best unemployment numbers, African-American, Asian- American, Hispanic American, everybody -- best unemployment numbers in history, best stock market we've ever had. But success does it and we were ready to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: Joining me now for reaction, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with media reporter for \"The Hill\", Joe Concha, and \"Relatable\" podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey. Thank you so much for joining us. Gregg, I want to start with you because \"The Washington Post\" really did need to settle this. They overstep their bounds with Nicholas Sandmann. It wasn't a coincidence that on his 18th birthday, he signed this agreement. Boy, I would love to know how much he got. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL: Yes, I would imagine tens of millions of dollars. But it underscores how the liberal mainstream media feels empowered to smear and defame anybody they perceived to be either conservative or pro- Trump and Nicholas Sandmann was the prime target for this. His only crime was wearing a MAGA hat. So, he must be therefore villainized and demonized and that's what they did. They accused him of racism, provoking a confrontation, when in fact the opposite was true. Videotape evidence showed it. He was the victim of harassment and racial slurs. But the media doesn't care about facts and truth and evidence. They are willing to abandon all objectivity, suspend their sense of fairness but they were driven by this maniacal hatred of Trump. So anything that might damage him is justified to the mainstream media even if it destroys a young man. And we certainly saw so much of this narrative driven by the media that was false in the Russian collusion case, in which they persistently for three long years told Americans that Trump was a Russian agent who colluded with Moscow in the bowels of the Kremlin and, of course, they ignored all the compelling evidence to the contrary. So, this is media malpractice on steroids. It will not change, throwing money at a problem is the easy way out, they will never apologize for their wrongful practices and it's no wonder that Americans no longer trust journalism. CHAFFETZ: No, I think he was right to sue and evidently to settle. And, you know, this is not a one-off situation, it happens regularly. Now, Allie Beth, I want to talk to you about that Cato Institute poll because that was fascinating, nearly two and three Americans saying that they feel intimidated based on what they would be willing to say because of the political backlash. ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, \"RELATABLE\" PODCAST HOST: We have seen people fire that simply forcing that Trump is the president of the United States. There was a baseball coach the other day who got fired literally for tweeting that President Trump is the president of the United States. You got people who have gotten fired for disagreeing with Black Lives Matter. And so, of course, people are scared to speak up. They are thinking about providing for themselves, providing for their families, their livelihoods, in some cases, their lives. So, they're not going to want to be outspoken about their support for President Trump or for saying that they are conservatives. Now, the interesting thing is, what does that going to mean for November? So, as we did in 2016, we thought that we saw a lot of anti-Trump energy that would lead to Hillary Clinton winning while there seems to be a lot of energy out in the streets right now against President Trump and against conservatism, against the law and order, that I think some Democrats are thinking that that's going to bode well for Joe Biden. The fact of the matter is, we just don't know. There are so many people who are intimidated into silence, but it's really hard to tell who really is out there, supporting President Trump implicitly and silently. So, unfortunately, we're unable to boldly come out, and to say our political views and to have the debate and dialogue that would be so productive and so good for this country, and so, some people just kind of -- they feel like they hide away in their homes and not talk about the views for the good of their family. But we'll see. We'll see what happens in the ballot box in November. CHAFFETZ: It is a sad day because people should be able to speak their mind and we as a nation should be able to have that discussion. But I found it interesting in that poll, only staunch liberals felt comfortable enough to share their opinions out loud and I think that's going to show up in the polling, or why the polling is going to be off yet again. Joe, though, I want to go and talk about Joe Biden. He is hiding there in his basement, really taking these softball interviews. The president day by day is taking hard interviews and he's able to sit down with Barstool Sports and talk to a whole audience that normally isn't necessarily watching -- although they should be watching this program, and he's able to do some things that Joe Biden is not able to do. JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE HILL: Well, for instance, sit down and actually do interviews, right, and Joe Biden hasn't had a press conference, Jason, in over 100 days. And even the press conference that he had about a week or two ago, he took questions from exactly six reporters. So, look, the president's base is still very much with him. You see approval numbers within the GOP in the 90 percent range. He doesn't have to worry about that too much. But what he has to do is shore up the type of people that voted for him in 2016, because remember, the difference was in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, not so much bringing people from the other side, but people who are actually never voted before. So, he's now reaching out to people that maybe aren't paying attention to the election, or really aren't involved in politics, going to a place like Barstool, it's a perfect place to do that, Jason, and it's just amazing, it's nearly a hundred days, only a hundred days until the election and you have one candidate who is very active in terms of media appearances and you have another that is sitting in a safe space hoping to run out the clock. And Hillary Clinton tried that in 2016, she didn't have a press conference in nearly 270 days, and we all know how that worked out, Jason. CHAFFETZ: That's right. And, look, President Trump sat down with Chris Wallace and answered the tough questions for an hour, I dare Joe Biden to try to be able to do the same. I don't think he can get through it. But he should -- he really should, to do the country right, and they ought to have three debates also. Gentlemen, Gregg and Joe, and Allie Beth, thank you so much for joining us tonight. We really do appreciate it. STUCKEY: Thank you. CHAFFETZ: All right. Directly ahead, tensions are rising with China and that's not good news for Joe Biden. Gordon Chang and Tammy Bruce will be her, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this \"Hannity\" special. Tonight, tensions with China are escalating. After the United States demanded the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, China is retaliating by ordering the United States' Chengdu consulate shut. And on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a historic speech, laying out what is at stake with America's showdown with China. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: If we don't act now, ultimately, the CCP will erode our freedoms and subvert the rules-based order that our societies have worked so hard to build. If we bend the knee now, our children's children may be at the mercy of the Chinese communist party whose actions are the primary challenge today and the free world (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: Joining us now for reaction is China expert Gordon Chang and FOX News contributor, Tammy Bruce. Thank you for joining us. Gordon, give us your analysis because we shudder the Houston consulate, they shut one of ours. Give us your analysis. GORDON CHANG, CHINA EXPERT: I think that both the shutting of the Houston consulate and that Chengdu one are both wins for the U.S. Closing Houston has two things. First of all, it can no longer be used as a base for subversion. There are unconfirmed reports that that consulate had links with protest groups in the U.S. Also, we know that it was used as a base for subversion. They were going especially after energy companies because of the South China Sea connections. Closing Chengdu was good for us because China has been grabbing Americans as hostages and so the fewer diplomats we have in China, the fewer potential hostages there are. And if we can't support American businesses, they shouldn't be in China for many reasons. So I have no problems with the closing of both consulates. It's a great day for us. CHAFFETZ: That's interesting. Now, Tammy, Joe Biden has downplayed China. He said it's not a threat and yet, the secretary of state and Donald Trump are saying it's our biggest threat. There couldn't be more of a contrast. I can't think of more times that Joe Biden was right on foreign policy, but give us your thoughts on this. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, obviously, Joe Biden represents the old guard, the old theory, the old world. I'm sure China is shocked. Donald Trump did his best to create a better dynamic and to negotiate. But I think the reality crept up on the president and the fact that China - - the Chinese communist party is a cancer and you don't negotiate with cancer. And this is becoming apparent. So, now, the Chinese are realizing that this is a genuine shift in American foreign policy because it's been the other way where they've been placated, where we've gotten into bed with them, where it was this global world order, and they, you know, had the advantage effectively. So, Joe Biden in every single way is an example of the old world and those failed policies, and that's why he's in the front. That's why he's this, well, this seat holder, this individual who is going to allow that system to return and I think that that's key when you realize what's at stake here when it comes to foreign policy and China in particular. It's a cold war at this stage. CHAFFETZ: So, Gordon, do you believe that China is the biggest threat or is it Joe Biden that's not a threat at all? CHANG: Clearly, China is the biggest threat to the United States. You know, China is challenging the U.S. and international system across the board. China has been involved in the invasion of India, the boat bumping, and the other incidents in the South China Sea, and East China Sea. All of the threats to invade Taiwan, the take over of Hong Kong, the increasing challenge in -- against the U.S. Navy and the global commons. And China's ruler, Xi Jinping, actually believes that China is the world's only sovereign state. So, clearly, this challenge is existential to the United States. And the secretary of state yesterday was absolutely correct when he talked about the consequences of China's challenge to us. CHAFFETZ: Thank you both. Tammy, I wish we had more time -- (CROSSTALK) CHAFFETZ: We have a hard out. I got to go, Tammy. I really do appreciate both of you joining us on this beautiful Friday night. We will be right back with more of this special edition of \"Hannity.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\" If you want to dive deeper into understanding the swamp that is Washington, D.C., I recommend my book \"Power Grab.\" I also wrote one called \"The Deep State.\" I hope you enjoy it. If you can find both of my books, as well as my photography portfolio on my website. Thanks for joining us on this special edition of \"Hannity.\" Sean will be back in the seat on Monday.

The president of the National Organization for Women is facing pressure from board members to resign following accusations that one of America\u2019s oldest feminist organizations has a long \"problem of racism,\"\u00a0according to a report. NOW President Toni Van Pelt has been accused of exhibiting racist behavior by more than 15 former staffers and interns, according to an investigation published by The Daily Beast on Saturday, which cited both interviews and internal documents. Her former vice president, Gilda Yazzie, has filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging Van Pelt aimed to shoulder her out of her leadership position in part because she is Native American. NAVAL ACADEMY TRUSTEE RESIGNS, APOLOGIZES FOR USING RACIAL SLURS ON ACCIDENTAL FACEBOOK LIVE STREAM Monica Weeks, who is of Cuban descent, said she ran for vice president in 2017 on an \u201call-women-of-color ticket\u201d but was heckled by other NOW members during her speech, with some calling out \u201cwhite women, too!\u201d She ultimately lost the election. Current vice president, Christian Nunes, who is black, told The Daily Beast that, though her tenure with the organization began well, she has since experienced racism and tokenism, and was not consulted before NOW sent out a statement on the death of George Floyd. \u201cI was so upset and mad I called my mom crying,\u201d Nunes told The Daily Beast. \u201cI thought that I was really going to be able to help this organization. But ultimately I feel like I've just been a token.\u201d President Toni Van Pelt (left) and Vice President Christian Nunes (right) of the National Organization for Women. Nunes also claimed Van Pelt fell asleep on her desk during a racial justice training and excluded her from certain meetings. Since The Daily Beast investigation was published, nine out of the 17 NOW board members have called for Van Pelt\u2019s removal. In an email to colleagues on Saturday, they said NOW \u201cshould be led by an individual who has the full confidence of its leadership and members to not only carry out but also represent the mission of the organization.\u201d \u201cIt has become clear to us that President Toni Van Pelt no longer has that confidence and we respectfully request she resign within 24 hours,\u201d the email stated. Twelve votes are needed to oust the president. In her own email to colleagues sent out Friday, Van Pelt wrote: \u201cAll Black Lives Matter. As a White woman, I\u2019ll never understand the experiences of women of color. I challenge myself to address structural racism and recognize that this is a lifelong, ongoing process. \u201cI do understand it is critical to acknowledge my own privilege and strive to be a better ally. As the leader of NOW, and a leader within the intersectional feminist movement, I must hold myself and our organization accountable to do more,\u201d she said.

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. If you've been paying attention recently, and you probably have, you've likely sensed that something profound is happening to this country right now, something that could transform what America is. You can feel it happening. Our leaders deny it. Officials on both sides reassured us, they're not planning wholesale changes to the country. They're just trying to fix specific problems. A man was brutalized by police officers in Minneapolis. Another man was shot to death in the parking lot of Wendy's. Those things were bad, they are telling us, and abuses like that are what they are fighting against. They say we need new laws, more good faith, more attention to injustice, and that sounds right to most Americans. Americans are decent people. They want to do the right thing. Certainly, Republicans in Congress who appear to believe all of this or maybe they're just so scared, they pretend they believe it. Either way, just yesterday, the G.O.P. leadership enthusiastically backed a Law Enforcement Reform Bill. They're proud of that. They seem to think that reining in the police will fix the underlying problems. And pretty soon, we can all get back to living in 2014 again. Republicans appear to believe this is a policy debate. But Democrats know better than that. They don't lie to themselves. They understand there is a revolution in progress. The death of George Floyd may have sparked widespread outrage, sincere outrage, and they may share that outrage. But they also know that what is happening now has very little to do with George Floyd or people like him. Like all revolutions, the point is to destroy the current system and replace it with something new. Or replace it with what? That's the question the rest of us should be asking right now. We should know what's coming. We know what we have now. Our current system has been in place for hundreds of years. It's based on a very simple idea: all people are created by God with equal moral value. Period. Every one of them. For that reason, and that reason alone, all Americans are treated equally under the laws of the United States. In this country, we judge you for what you do, not how you were born. That idea has been the defining principle of America since the 18th Century. It's the main reason we are the fairest society in the world. It's the reason people move here. To the extent America has failed to live up to that principle of equality, we are ashamed of it, we should be. Equality is the most important thing we have. We should defend it. We should practice it. Now for the first time in our history, we're witnessing a broad and powerful attack on the principle of equality. Daily, we are told that all people are not in fact created equal. Some were born with moral stain, others were not. Some Americans are guilty, some are innocent. Nothing can change this, because it was all determined at birth. All we can do is respond accordingly. People in favorite groups must be held to one standard. Those in disfavored groups, the morally tainted ones, must be held to another standard. The country retains one set of laws mostly for the sake of formality. But we must apply those laws in very different ways according to the DNA and the background of the accused. If that sounds familiar, it's because this kind of system we just described, this system based on heredity and blood guilt has been very common in history. It was the rule in feudal Europe, for example, and the totalitarian regimes on that continent more recently. It's still in practice in parts of the world. In North Korea, children are sent to prison camps for the sins of their ancestors. And unfortunately, we have seen it here, too. You may have wondered how politicians could have justified practices as perverse as slavery and Jim Crow in a country with a constitution like ours and the answer is simple, by arguing that not all people are created equal. Some had lesser moral value from birth. That's what they said. Those people carried the stain of sin with them. You are allowed to treat them differently based on who they were. At the time, many understood that this was a lie. Slavery persisted for hundreds of years, but they were always some in authority who considered it evil. Not evil simply because it was abusive, which of course it was, but because the existence of it violated the central principle of this country, and they were right. Where are those people now? Look around. Is anyone in power defending absolute equality under the law? If there was ever a time to remind America that we all have equal value under God, that time is right now. But no, no one in charge is saying that. Our leaders are cowards when we need them to be brave. They are muddled when we need them to think clearly. It's possible they no longer even believe in equality. Forty years ago, this was a middle class country and as a result, America had strongly egalitarian values. Pretty much everyone used commercial airports and ate at McDonald's. Do you remember that? People talked without irony about their rights as citizens and taxpayers. You couldn't pay extra to jump to the head of the line at Disney World. The idea that someone like Jeffrey Epstein could beat a sex charge because he was rich would have shocked us then. We would have demanded an investigation into just how Jeffrey Epstein died. Why? Because Americans hated corruption. They saw corruption as an offense against equality. That was 40 years ago. Things were moving in the opposite direction ever since. We now accept uncritically the claim that some people deserve better treatment based on how they were born and some deserve worse. This is the most poisonous and the most destructive of all ideas. Other nations understand that. Rwanda has made it a crime to make ethnic appeals during elections to practice identity politics, because they know very well where that leads. Yet, identity politics is accelerating here. It shouldn't surprise you that most of the people pushing this poison are benefiting from it. They're using the recent chaos to codify dangerous trends already in progress, a permanently unequal society where some citizens are elevated and others are crushed. Winners and losers preordained by law. That's the country they're working toward. At the same time, and this is always the tell. They lecture you with maximum self-righteousness about how they're doing precisely the opposite of that. What they're really doing, they claim, is upholding equality under the law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): No one is above the law. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody is above the law. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): No one is above the law. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): No one is above the law. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No one is above the law. REP. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE (D-TX): No one is above the law. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That no person is above the law. SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): Nobody should be above the law. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): Nobody should be above the law. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): No one is above the law. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: No one is above the law, they scold, meaning you aren't, you are not above their laws. You must obey those laws to the letter or you will face certain punishment. Others meanwhile, get a pass for an entirely separate set of laws. Revolutionaries don't acknowledge universal standards. Increasingly, they admit this out loud, they're not pretending anymore. In California, Democrats are moving to repeal Proposition 209. Proposition 209 explicitly bans racial discrimination in hiring and education. In other words, Democrats in California are now fighting for discrimination. This is not considered strange in 2020. No one even mentions it. A couple of weeks ago, Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky announced plans to bring universal health insurance to his state, but not for all citizens, just for people with the right skin color. Everyone else would pay, but only certain ethnic groups would benefit. Andy Beshear is still in office tonight. No one has tried to impeach him for suggesting this because ideas like this are everywhere now. They're totally unchallenged. This is the most divisive possible way to run a country. If you wanted to make certain that your children would hate each other, you would hold them to different standards, and they certainly would. There is a reason that racial tension is rising in this country, it's by design. But race is not the only dividing line. The coronavirus lockdowns have nothing to do with race, with white or black. Thank God. They're probably the only thing in America right now that doesn't. Quarantines are instead scientific. They're purely a matter of public health. That's what they told us and we believed them. We sat passively as they destroyed our country's economy as they indicted Americans for trying to make a living. And then the Black Lives Matter riots started and we learned that it was all fake. The very same officials who threatened us with arrest for going outside, urged their own voters to flood the streets, and they did and no one was punished. How could this happen? It was such a flagrant, double standard, not even hidden, right in your face. They didn't try to explain it. They didn't bother to justify it. Why? Anyone familiar with totalitarianism regimes can tell you exactly why and what's going on. This is ritual humiliation. Forcing people to accept mistreatment is a time tested way to subdue them. Of course, we're not treating you fairly, they're telling us. You don't deserve fairness. You deserve what you get. That's the message. And after a while the population accepts this. Some believe it. They blame themselves. That's the goal. But we should never accept it. The promise of absolute equality under the law is all we have. Laws are designed to protect the weak, not the strong. At the moment, the people leading this revolution against our system are strong. That's why they're trying to subvert our laws. If they succeed, there will be nothing to protect the rest of us in this country. We cannot let them do that. In the United States of America, all of us are equal under the law. Period. Say that as loud as you can. JD Vance is the author of \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" He joins us tonight. JD, I can't imagine that one in a thousand Americans seeks to divide the population by race. It's the cruelest and longest lasting sin you could commit, I think in a country and yet clearly there are people who are intentionally trying to do that. Why? JD VANCE, AUTHOR: Well, I think that you have to ask yourself who benefits from a lot of this tension and a lot of this division. If you think about a business, black owned or white owned that was destroyed in a riot over the last few weeks, who gets richer from that? We know that Amazon has a little bit more market share. And so Jeff Bezos makes a little bit more money. If you think about what prevents new businesses from coming online and competing with those mega corporations that rule our financial world, well, every time a small business gets denied for a loan, every time a small business goes out of business, that's obviously good for the folks who run our corporate culture. And at the end of the day, what are we not talking about right now that we should be talking about? We're not talking about the opioid epidemic, which kills 70,000 people still in this country. We're not talking about concentrated financial power, which is the biggest problem that white and black middle class Americans face today. And at the end of the day, what we're doing is creating an entire narrative that's dividing the country instead of actually causing middle and working class people to unify and to try to convince through political means others to share power with them. CARLSON: Do you think that explanation might explain why the turmoil we're watching has been largely funded by corporate America? VANCE: I think that's a huge part of it, Tucker, and one of the weirdest things, you know, people on the left right now act like they're on the side of the oppressed. They like to think that they're standing up for the little guy, they're standing up for working people, but on every single one of these major issues, if you look at the big Supreme Court cases that have come down the line in the past few days. You look at what's happening with the protests. You look at the actual goals of the protests as they've been stated, abolish the police. If you look at public policy polling, 70 percent of black Americans actually like their local police department. How is it that on all of these big debates, the left finds itself on the side of Corporate America? It finds itself on the side of international businesses. You know, if I was a member of a political movement that stood up for working people and found myself every single time on the side of Amazon, on the side of Apple, on the side of Google, I might ask myself, if I've actually chosen the right allies, and what it says about me, but unfortunately, too many folks on the left just aren't doing that. CARLSON: Why are Republicans playing along with this? I mean, they seem to think -- I've been thinking of this all day that this is some kind of policy debate that can be won by passing some stupid Bill in the Congress. The people -- they're arguing against see this as a revolution that will replace our current system with a new one. Why is that a hard concept for elected Republicans to grasp? VANCE: Well, if you step back a little bit from our current debates, one of the things that's pretty obvious is that the Republican Party has been for far too long in the pocket of major corporate interests. That's true in the think tank world in D.C., it's true for a lot of major Republican politicians. And I think the Republicans have just so forgotten that there are real economic, real social challenges in this country that needs to be solved, that they're comfortable with just doing whatever the mainstream media says that they should be doing, instead of actually fighting back in a real and substantive way. Really, the story of the past 30 or 40 years of American politics, unfortunately, is that in their own different ways, the left and the right have both found themselves effectively preaching that they're standing up for the middle class, when in reality, they're just standing up for corporate interests. And so unfortunately, I think the answer to your question is Republicans have just gotten used to not solving real problems, to not legislating, to not doing the things that they're supposed to be doing as political leaders. And this is almost the most important point here, Tucker, if you look at the average American, black, white, brown, whatever, they're very sensible. They want common sense solutions. They recognize that something is pretty broken about our current system. It's fundamentally a problem of leadership that we're not talking about the biggest issues that confront us as a country. And so, you know, unfortunately, that falls on Republicans just as much as it does with Democrats. CARLSON: They're not defending their voters or any American. It's can't last, I would say. JD Vance, thank you for your insightful analysis of that. VANCE: Thanks. CARLSON: Well, today in the House, Matt Gaetz wound up in a -- Congressman Matt Gaetz went up in an argument with a Democratic member of Congress who told him he was not allowed to participate because he was a white man, and he doesn't understand what it's like to raise a child who doesn't look like him. That prompted the Congressman to respond in a very personal way. He joins us after the break with his response. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: The Cultural Revolution now in progress is making a dangerous term. It's actually been here for quite some time. You're watching elected leaders say you are not allowed to participate in our system if you're the wrong color. During a recent argument on the House floor, Democratic Congressman Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, argued that some people just shouldn't be in the debate because they're the wrong skin color or their children aren't. Richmond's claims started off with a fight with Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND (D-LA): You all are a white male. You've never lived in my shoes and you do not know what it's like to be an African American male. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Are you suggesting that you're certain that none of us have non-white children? Because you reflected on your black son and you said none of us could understand that. RICHMOND: Matt, Matt. Stop. I'm not about to get sidetracked about the color of our children. We're talking about black. I reclaim my time. It is not about the color of your kids. It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed and if one of them happens to be your kid, I'm concerned about him, too. And clearly, I'm more concerned about him than you are. So, let's be clear about that. GAETZ: So you're claiming so -- you're claiming you have more concern for my family than I do? Who in the hell do you think you are? REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Gentlemen, gentlemen -- RICHMOND: If the shoe fits. GAETZ: Look -- you don't know how much we care for our own families. RICHMOND: A kicked doll hollers. GAETZ: This is outrageous. You should take those words down. NADLER: The gentlemen -- GAETZ: If you are concerned about your family and love your family, so do we, damn it. NADLER: The gentleman will suspend. The gentleman suspend. The time belongs to the gentleman from Louisiana. Cedric would you yield? RICHMOND: Was that a nerve? GAETZ: Yes, you're damn right, it was a nerve. RICHMAN: I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: When you attack people on the basis of their race and their children, you get exchanges like that. It's disgusting. Of course, Cedric Richmond will never be disciplined for it. Afterwards, Matt Gaetz issued this statement on Twitter. \"For all those wondering, this is my son, Nestor. We share no blood, but he is my life. He came from Cuba legally of course, six years ago and lives with me in Florida. Congressman Matt Gaetz joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. So, Cedric Richmond, who the way, went to Tulane Law School and brags about his Harvard degree, mister oppressed character here, was telling you that you're not allowed to participate in the conversation because of your skin color? GAETZ: I believe everyone should be able to participate if they're black, white or otherwise, and it's certainly offensive to have someone tell you that, you know, you don't know what a certain experience is like when they know nothing about you. Nestor is the light of my life. I couldn't imagine him loving him anymore, if he was my own flesh and blood. I've raised him for the last six years and he is just the most remarkable young man. I am proud of him. And I am - - I'm honestly embarrassed for the United States Congress that we've resorted to criticizing each other based on our race and the race of our children and I wish that we would be more productive going forward. CARLSON: So did any Republicans at your side of the aisle stand up and make that point? I mean, it seems like a pretty basic threshold that we're not going to attack people for things they can't control, like their skin color. Did anyone else join in your defense? GAETZ: Well, there were some Republicans who, you know, pointed out that we shouldn't be treating anybody differently as a consequence of their race. I've just got to say though, he is a remarkable young man. I am proud of him. And I've run Nestor to believe that in our family, we treat everyone equally. It doesn't matter what their background is, what their race is, we treat every American with respect. CARLSON: Does he learn that at school as well, do you think? I mean, do you think the culture in which he is growing up reinforces that obvious and most American of all messages? GAETZ: Well, why don't you ask him, Tucker? He is, I think piped in from the studio in Florida. CARLSON: Nestor, thanks for joining us. What do you make of Cedric Richmond's attack? Did you see all of this? NESTOR GALBAN, SON OF REP. MATT GAETZ: I did not see it because I was sleeping from my work out from the night before. But yes, once I woke up, I woke up to seeing all these sweets and I was like, what's going on? And Matt gave me a call telling me about it, and then I saw it. And I think it's kind of unfair to not -- to tell someone that they don't understand because they don't have, like, because of their racial color, while like, he is fighting for equality, but if you tell someone to not get involved that he doesn't understand because of his color, you're kind of being a hypocrite there. CARLSON: Yes, I think that's very nicely put. Matt, I mean, Congressman Gaetz. Saying something like this out loud seems like the kind of thing that, you know, in normal times you'd be censured for. GAETZ: I cannot believe that it's acceptable in the United States Congress for someone to tell someone else that they're fighting for their children more than they are. Tucker, you have a son? How would you feel if someone said to you that they, you know, we're fighting for your own family more than you are. So that's why I got very upset. But you know, for the for the sake of Nestor and my story, we're a proud, happy family. We love each other very much. And Nestor is on his way off to college in the fall, and I just couldn't be happier and prouder of the young man he has become and the fact that he is embracing these American values that everyone should be treated fairly and equally. CARLSON: That's exactly right. I tell my kids, you're not responsible for who your relatives are in their case, thank heaven. You're responsible for what you do and the choices that you make. That's the promise of America. If we abandon that, we're done. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. Nestor, nice to meet you. GAETZ: Thank you. GALBAN: Nice to meet you, too, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, a police officer is facing execution tonight for killing a suspect armed with one of his weapons, a Taser. It's not because the police officer broke the law. That's pretty clear. It's because the mob is demanding his head. We'll tell you what we mean after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Police Officer Garrett Rolfe of Atlanta has been charged with murder. He is facing the death penalty for shooting a man called Rayshard Brooks. Rayshard Brooke stole a police Taser and tried to use it against Officer Rolfe, now Atlanta Police are in turmoil with plunging morale, widespread absenteeism and reports that people are resigning in large groups. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has the very latest on this. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. Officers Devin Brosnan and Garrett Rolfe both surrendered to authorities just before noon today. Brosnan bonded out less than an hour later, but Garrett Rolfe is being held without bail for felony murder in the shooting death of 27-year-old, Rayshard Brooks who was found last Friday night sleeping in the drive-thru of an Atlanta Wendy's. When Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard laid out the charges, he said his office interviewed 10 witnesses and watched eight videos from body cams, cell phones and surveillance cameras. The DA and his team concluded that Rayshard Brooks never displayed aggression and never presented himself as a threat quoting here, \"Even though Mr. Brooke was slightly impaired, his demeanor during this incident was almost jovial.\" Garrett Rolfe's attorney has called the DA's statements unethical saying the DA is prohibited from making comments to heighten the public condemnation of the accused. As for the DA's contention that Brooks was jovial and posed no threat, Rolfe's attorney says during the incident, Rayshard Brooks committed three felonies: resisting arrest, attacking officers, punching Officer Rolfe in the face and taking Officer Brosnan's Taser and pointing it at him. Officer Brosnan's attorney also knocked down the DA's comment about cooperation. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON SAMUEL, DEVIN BROSNAN ATTORNEY: I regret that the District Attorney apparently was given misinformation yesterday and Officer Brosnan is not going to be a quote, \"state's witness.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: The DA was also criticized for not allowing the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to complete its investigation into the shooting, and meantime, we should note, the Atlanta Police Department says they're experiencing a high number of officers calling out sick for their shifts, but maintain they do have enough resources to be able to respond to calls - - Tucker. CARLSON: We'll see if that holds true tomorrow. Trace Gallagher, thanks so much. GALLAGHER: Okay. CARLSON: Stacy Abrams, who pretends to be the Governor of Georgia despite losing that office and many other Democratic officeholders tell us that Officer Rolfe deserves to face execution because Rayshard Brooks only had a Taser. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STACY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: There's a legitimacy to this anger. There's a legitimacy to this outrage. A man was murdered because he was asleep in a drive-thru. Because what happened yesterday to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force and the decision that the fact that they were either embarrassed or you know, panicked led them to murder a man who they knew only had a Taser in his hand. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: They didn't know he only had a Taser in his hand. Stacy Abrams is making that up, as she often does make things up. But she's arguing that Tasers are basically harmless toys. So the question is, how long has this standard existed? You can take a guess. It was invented this week by demagogues like Stacy Abrams when it became useful for furthering racial division, which is their signature. In 2012, a \"New York Times\" tweet warned that quote, \"Tasers shot the chest can kill, a study warns.\" Literally just two weeks ago, Fulton County's District Attorney was explaining that under Georgia law, Tasers are deadly weapons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL HOWARD, FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: And charged with aggravated assault of Mrs. Pilgrim. And this is for pointing a Taser at Mrs. Pilgrim and as many of you all know, under Georgia law, a Taser is considered as a deadly weapon under Georgia law. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: And in fact, there are many cases of police in this country being cleared for shooting suspects who grabbed their Tasers. In 2018, for example, officers in Miami Dade County ordered felony suspect Jamal Parker to sit on the ground. Instead of sitting, Parker charged them, grabbed a Taser and pointed it at the officers. He was shot. He survived. But the officers were not charged for shooting him. It was considered justified. In 2013, in Dallas, Texas, Salvador Munoz seized a Taser from an officer, refused to drop it when asked and was set to use it against the officer. He was shot dead. We could list others. Here's one more. It's also from Georgia. A year ago, David Schmidt was running into traffic, blocking cars and according to some accounts trying to get into the cars, Officer Eduardo Guerrero arrived to apprehend him. When he did, Schmidt attacked the officer. Guerrero tried to use his Taser. He wanted to use less than deadly force, but Schmidt instead seized the Taser and tried to use it on the officer. When he did that, Guerrero shot him. The results of all of this, Guerrero has been cleared. The DA in that case told us and we're quoting, \"I found the shooting legally justified and declined to pursue any charges against the officer,\" end quote. \"The New York Times\" did not do a series of articles on that event. Schmidt meanwhile has been charged with aggravated assault. But that of course all happened last year. This year is Year Zero, and that means brand new rules for everyone because the revolution is in progress. Vincent Champion in Southeast Regional Director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the police union in Atlanta and we're happy to have him tonight. Mr. Champion, thanks so much for coming out. So, it looks to me like this officer is being charged under a standard that didn't exist before this week. VINCENT CHAMPION, SOUTHEAST REGIONAL DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF POLICE OFFICERS: We couldn't agree with you more. We believe that the officer has not been given his due process. We believe that this is nothing more but a political move by the District Attorney. CARLSON: Have you ever seen this happen to an officer before? Charged with murder for shooting a man who was pointing his own Taser at him? CHAMPION: No, I've never seen that, and I've never seen anyone charged with murder without a full investigation. CARLSON: Right. Thank you for pointing that out. That there is -- or was at least an investigation in progress of this incident, but the District Attorney who is in a runoff for reelection and facing corruption charges decided that he wasn't going to wait for it. So, how are police officers in Atlanta responding to this? CHAMPION: Well, the police officers are definitely scared, and I get scared as it is, but they're afraid to do their job at this point because -- not because they're afraid of how to do it, they've been trained to do that. They know what they're doing. The problem is they've been betrayed and backstabbed by their own Mayor, the DA, and now everybody is thinking that if we go out and do our job the way we were trained and lawfully, we still could be terminated because the Mayor in the city doesn't like the way it looked on video. The problem with that is, 95 percent of all videos that you watch of police officers, you know, doing their job, don't look good. So, if that's a standard we're going to go by, that's a terrible standard. And then you've got a DA who doesn't even do an investigation or allow the proper authorities to do the investigation, as he has done for you know, years now. That he makes that decision and goes as far as charges them to also almost put a person to death for doing his job. CARLSON: Yes. Charged on the death penalty offense. Do you think this will draw attention away from the accusation that the DA stole money -- government money from a nonprofit? CHAMPION: Well, I hope not, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen, and we appreciate you doing everything that you can to keep that from happening. But I do believe that is what he is trying to do. CARLSON: Has it occurred to you, Mr. Champion, that politicians in Atlanta, you said police officers won't be able to do their jobs? And that's clearly true. Has it occurred to you that maybe that's the point of this? Maybe there are politicians in Atlanta who don't want police officers to enforce the law. CHAMPION: It has definitely crossed our mind, especially, you know, since we had distinguished between the protesters and rioters, but since the rioters are here, and we hear them calling out to, you know, they don't need police departments and we don't do anything but you know kill innocent people. So, I think they're listening to that, and they've decided maybe we don't need a police department and that is the worst decision they could ever make. CARLSON: You've been a cop, obviously. You represent them as union official, what do you think would happen to Atlanta if the police disappeared? CHAMPION: Well, it would look a lot worse than when they were when they had the riots and then the question would be, would it become just like what we're seeing now? And I wish people would look at that and what's going on in the north with the taking of the area? Somebody will eventually take up arms and say they are the law there, which is what's happened already, and once they take those up and do it, how -- you know, what are their -- at least now you have laws and rules and training that we have, that we have to abide by and go through? What is -- what are these people going to do? They're just going to decide what they want to do when they want to do and they're going to kill or hurt whoever they decide that they feel it's necessary. CARLSON: That's exactly -- that is such a wise point and I'm glad that you said that out loud. If you got rid of all police, it wouldn't mean the end of authority, it would mean the rise of armed militia and it would mean and it would mean that, you know, we've basically become a third world country and maybe that's what they're looking for. Vincent Champion, I really appreciate your coming on tonight. I can't imagine what your life is like right now. Good luck. CHAMPION: Well, thank you very much, sir. CARLSON: Well, a final point tonight, a kind of coda, which really tells you everything about what's happening to our country right now, how it has gone with amazing quickness from one of the most tolerant places of goodwill on the planet to something very different, very, very fast. So, we've been telling you the story of the police officer charged, Officer Rolfe. Until today, his stepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But today, she was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently, she was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Ralph's stepmother. According to source familiar with the matter who spoke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job was safe. But today she was told and we are quoting, \"We have to terminate our relationship with you.\" No other explanation was offered and honestly no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened. Rolfe has already been scrubbed from the company's website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations. This is where the country is going. It's becoming a place where you can be punished for the supposed misdeeds of your relatives. You don't want to be that country. All of us should put on the brakes immediately. Well, Seattle isn't just the home of Earth's 196th country, CHOP. Other things are happening there, too. Problems that have been around a lot longer than CHOP, a business owner says he is about to give up on Seattle. He has been there for four decades, but he is leaving. He'll tell us why, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: We just told you a moment ago that the stepmother of Officer Rolfe, the Atlantic cop who is facing the death penalty for the shooting of Rayshard Brooks was just fired from her job today at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in the Atlanta area. We told you she was fired with no explanation, obviously, because it disapproved of who her stepson was, and in America we don't do things like that because it's immoral. We just got a statement sent to us from Equity Prime Mortgage. They're blaming Rolfe's stepmother, alluding to social media comments. They don't specify what those are. Then they added a long boilerplate comment about how they support diversity. The bottom line is, it seems pretty clear they fired this woman because of who her stepson was, and just to restate the obvious, that shouldn't happen in this country, because it's wrong. And people should say it's wrong or it will continue to keep happening. Well, we've been highly amused this week, the one bright spot in the week really was the nation of CHOP. It's a deeply progressive place with a very secure border and its own armed guards. But CHOP has just the latest problem for a city that has become unlivable for a lot of people who are from there, Joey Rodolfo knows that well. He owns a store called Buki, it's a clothing store based in downtown Seattle. He was forcibly shut down due to coronavirus. Then this month, his store was looted during riots. But he says the city's troubles have been building for much longer than that. Joey Rodolfo joins us tonight from Seattle. Joey, thanks so much for coming on. So your point is that the triple whammy of coronavirus, these riots and now, CHOP. That's just the latest in a series of problems. Tell us what you faced as a store owner in Seattle. JOEY RODOLFO, SEATTLE BUSINESS OWNER: Tucker, I've lived in Seattle for 38 years. For 38 years, in the last three years, I've seen the crime rate surge. I've seen homelessness/drugs and gangs take over our downtown, not to mention the destruction of property that's happening here in Seattle, and with no consequences. We have a judicial system here that is a revolving door. So if you're a store owner or a restaurant in Seattle, these are very, very difficult times. You know, it's -- I met with the Mayor at a dinner in February, and I walked up to her table and asked, listen, what can we do? What can you do to help us downtown to bring back downtown? It is a very simple question. What can you do? She says, listen, Joey, it sounds like you're very passionate about doing - - why don't I start a task force, and I'd like to invite you to be on it. And so this was in February. I called and called a call to her office, Tucker, to no answer. I will give her credit, she did decide that she has offered to buy my dinner, which I said, listen, no, thank you but how about serving up some law and order in this town? So, yes. So you know, we have reached a point here in Seattle where I call it, we are now a utopian socialist city, honestly, on the backs of all of us taxpaying citizens. That's where Seattle is right now. CARLSON: It doesn't look like utopia. It looks filthy and disgusting. That's your store behind you, right there? RODOLFO: Yes, this is what Seattle looks like and this is what people don't see when they go up to CHOP and whatever they call it today. CHOP, CHAZ, whatever they call it. So, yes, Tucker, you know, downtown has been decimated. All you see is plywood, particleboard. Stores opened up and there's no chance that this town will soon come alive again. Although, if you talk to the Mayor, she'll tell you that that's her goal. Here's what I'll tell you. This is -- you know, things couldn't get crazier, Tucker. The fact that the mayor sends more particleboard and art supplies to the people up on CHAZ. I call it Jenny's kids need, you know, stuff to do on their downtime so they get crayons, spray paint and more particleboard so they can occupy their downtime. That's what the craziness that is happening here. CARLSON: Your Mayor is a narcissist and a joke. RODOLFO: You know, exactly. CARLSON: Let me ask you, Joey. So you've paid taxes for 38 years in Seattle. In return, they've ignored you and let mobs destroy your livelihood. Are you going to stay? RODOLFO: Right. Tucker, I am telling you that speaking for myself and for other friends that have either restaurants or other businesses, I can tell you that it's about to have -- Seattle is going to experience a mass exodus and I hear people going to Idaho. CARLSON: Yes, a lot of people are -- a lot of people are going to Idaho. Joey, good luck and call us when you get to Boise, okay. I think it's probably better. RODOLFO: Thank you. CARLSON: Thanks a lot. RODOLFO: I'll be going to Arizona, Tucker. We're going to Arizona. Yes. CARLSON: Smart man. RODOLFO: All right. Yes. CARLSON: Thanks. Well, the Olympics had been postponed. Baseball may be canceled, but sure the NFL will be back, not so fast. Dr. Tony Fauci does not approve. He's still running the country for some reason. Dr. Marc Siegel reacts, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Pretty much every single NFL player is under the age of 40. All of them by definition are world class athletes. They play in the NFL. They are virtually at no risk from coronavirus. European soccer leagues know this, they have already restarted games there. So, why don't have the NFL return this fall? Dr. Tony Fauci is not a football fan, apparently. He just told CNN it may simply be too dangerous to let football return this year. Why exactly? Fox medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel joins us to unravel this mystery. Doctor, thanks for coming on. SIEGEL: Tucker, Dr. Fauci is a tremendous Infectious Disease expert, but he often steps outside his lane. Now, in this case, his lane is basketball. He was a star high school basketball player. When it comes to football, I talked on NFL radio last week about how we could make this happen. Now, as you have said already, football players are young. Even if they got COVID-19, God forbid, they would get a mild case most likely. We would test our trainers all the time. We would test the football players regularly, if not daily. We would look for symptoms. We would check them for temperature. Any kind of a sniffle even. And by the way, when it comes to football, Tucker, you know what the number one problem is? It's not going to be COVID-19 in professional football, it's going to be severe concussion, by far that's the problem, not COVID- 19. So, I think that we can start to move the ball forward on this especially since they've already got soccer going in Europe right now, all the way across Europe, lifting spirits and they're thinking of putting fans back in the stands in Italy for soccer next month. Speaking of fans, how are we going to do fans with professional football? Well, we're going to have to test the ticket takers, right? And we're going to have to alternate weeks or every third week, and we're going to have to social distance everybody, even social distance the beer and social distance to hotdogs. And by the way, when you're rooting for your team, you usually get very excited and you're shouting, so you could actually spread virus. So I want people to be very aware of that. And I might move the team if it's in a hot spot where COVID-19 is, and I don't want people with high risk conditions there. I don't want people overweight. I'd be very careful about that. And elderly people, senior citizens I wouldn't let in the games right away. Speaking of senior citizens, Tucker. There's one senior citizen I would give a pass to, a senior citizen by football standards. He is going to turn 43 this year, going down to Tampa Bay, the top passer of all time, Tucker. I want to give Tom Brady a pass and I want them to cheer us all on for the football season -- Tucker. CARLSON: I think it's medical advice most people would support. We'll just call it a BLM rally and just let it roll. Dr. Siegel, thanks so much. SIEGEL: Thank you. CARLSON: By the way, Barstools Dave Portnoy comes tomorrow to respond to this.

The body of Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights leader and Georgia politician, began its six-day journey in a celebration of life Saturday, with its first stops in Troy and Selma Alabama. Lewis, 80, died on July 17 after a six-month battle with cancer. This June 16, 2010 file photo, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., participates in a ceremony to unveil two plaques recognizing the contributions of enslaved African Americans in the construction of the United States Capitol on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) JOHN LEWIS MEMORIAL: FAMILY RELEASES DETAILS OF 6-DAY CELEBRATION OF HIS LIFE His casket, accompanied by a military honor guard, arrived draped in an American flag at Troy University ahead of \"A Service Celebrating 'The Boy from Troy'\" on Saturday. Troy Mayor Jason Reeves applauded Lewis' strength at \"confronting Alabama state troopers,\" during his time as an activist during the Civil Rights movement. \"And now Alabama state troopers will lead his body around this state as we celebrate his life,\" Reeves said. The casket of the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., arrives to lie in repose at Troy University on Saturday, July 25, 2020, in Troy, Ala. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) The event, with speeches from five of his 10 siblings-- his brothers, Henry \"Grant,\" Samuel and Freddie Lewis and sisters, Rosa Mae and Ethel Mae Tyner-- and a rendition of \"Hero,\" from Sheila Jackson, paid homage to Lewis' history in the city that set off his activism alongside Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in\u00a01958. It was over 60 years ago that Dr. King met\u00a0with the then 18-year-old \"boy from Troy\" who had\u00a0hopes of attending an all-white university. In this March 17, 1965, file photo, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., fourth from left, foreground, locks arms with his aides as he leads a march of several thousands to the courthouse in Montgomery, Ala. From left are: an unidentified woman, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, James Foreman, King, Jesse Douglas Sr., and John Lewis. (AP Photo/File) (AP) The school -- Troy University -- is the campus to host the first of several proceedings for Lewis beginning Saturday. \"He worked a lifetime to help others and make the world a better place in which to live,\" Grant Lewis said in his tribute. He shared a memory of when Lewis was sworn into Congress, saying that during the poignant moment, Lewis looked up at Grant and gave him a thumbs-up during the ceremony. Afterward, Grant asked him, \"What were you thinking?\" \"I was thinking this is a long way from the cotton fields of Alabama,\" Lewis responded. His young nephew infused\u00a0the somber ceremony with\u00a0laughter after delivering poignant words: \"it's up to keep his legacy alive\" before jumping off the stage. Lewis grew up in Pike County, Ala., and was an aspiring minister. The son of sharecroppers, he worked alongside his siblings-- who knew him as Robert--\u00a0on his family's land, tending the fields and animals.\u00a0The young Lewis would preach to the chickens to practice his craft. \"He came from humble beginnings, always humble and respectful,\" his sister Ethel Mae said. In 2011, the humble congressman was bestowed the\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Barack Obama for his fight against racial discrimination. In this Feb. 15, 2011, file photo, President Barack Obama presents a 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has worsened in Lewis' home state of Alabama, the family has requested that everyone wear a face mask\u00a0to prevent mourners and onlookers from spreading the virus. Seats at the university service were spaced six feet apart to abide by social distancing rules. \"Get in good trouble, necessary trouble\" Lewis's death comes amidst a national reckoning between law enforcement and their communities, as people all over the country protest against racial injustice facing\u00a0Black and Hispanic people. As an activist, Lewis himself was arrested and jailed dozens of times and attacked during periods of civil unrest. At an event in March to commemorate the anniversary of\u00a0the bloody upheaval\u00a0between police and protesters in 1965 at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where Lewis and other demonstrators were beaten with clubs by state troopers, and his skull was fractured, Lewis famously said: \"Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America.\" In this July 20, 2020, photo, a church sign honoring the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis sits near his family's land in Pike County, Ala. A series of services will be held to remember Lewis, beginning July 25, 2020, in his home state of Alabama. (AP Photo/Kimberly Chandler) The bridge will be another monumental stop Sunday on Lewis' journey\u00a0before his body lies in repose at the Alabama Capitol. He will be flown to Washington, D.C. on Monday and his casket will make several stops throughout the city, including at the Martin Luther King, Jr.\u00a0Memorial\u00a0near the National Mall. He will then\u00a0lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, with a public viewing. A bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., center, is visible behind the catafalque for the casket of the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., in the center of the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, Friday, July 24, 2020, before he lies in state Monday. Lewis, who carried the struggle against racial discrimination from Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress, died Friday, July 17, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) The honor to lay in the nation's Capitol Rotunda has been given to more than 30 distinguished figures in American history, including and most recently the late Sen. John McCain and late Rep. Elijah Cummings. Lewis will then be flown to Atlanta, where he will lie\u00a0in state at the Georgia\u00a0Capitol Wednesday, before his final internment on Thursday.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:\u00a0 But I will repeat what I said throughout this hearing that I made no promises to anyone. I have no agenda. There are 598 volumes of the United States report. That is something that -- JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 Welcome to THE FIVE, everybody. We are watching the Amy Coney Barrett hearing. And she is now facing questioning from Senator Mazie Hirono. Let's listen in. SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): So the 2006 newspaper ad you signed that said you, quote, \"Oppose abortion on demand and defended the right to life from fertilization to natural death.\" It's not just the fact that this newspaper ad you joined said what I just read, but it also said, quote, \"it's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe V. Wade.\" In a 2013 speech you gave were you said the Roe decision, quote, \"permitted abortion on demand,\" end quote, after you said you have opposed abortion on demand in 2006. So what underscores my concern about your willingness to overturn Roe V. Wade, which is really the expectation that the president has, and in which Senator Hawley fully expects you to do because you have met his litmus test. But you know that (Inaudible), which is precedent, and you have argued that a justice's duty to follow the constitution, which you're explaining (ph) that she should -- this regarding your view on precedent, that she should, quote, \"enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it,\" end quote. In fact, you said constitutional cases are the easiest to overrule because you bring your own assessment of what the Constitution requires. And as you said, if the precedent is clearly conflict with your view of the Constitution, then the precedent falls by the wayside. So you did indicate that there are a few cases that are immunized from overturning because are -- they wouldn't be challenged in the first place, i.e. Brown v. Board of Education. But Roe isn't one of those cases, because we know that there all kinds of challenges to Roe, basically because the states are very busy passing all of these laws than a woman's right to an abortion. So he also said in that speech that even if Roe is not overturned -- you said without overturning Roe, you explained, quote, \"the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion.\" And so there are 14 cases right now relating to state abortion restrictions making its way through the circuit court, and some of these are going to land in the Supreme Court. And these 14 cases include the following restrictions. Six cases involve bans on abortion, starting at gestational ages ranging from six to 24 weeks, two cases involving bans on a particular type of procedure, dilation and evacuation. That accounts for nearly all second trimester abortions. One case involving a requirement that fetal remains be buried or cremated. Four cases involve laws imposing unnecessary requirements on abortion providers, like transfer agreements with local hospitals. Four cases involve so-called reason bans, two cases related to parental notification and consent. There are real reasons why the American public is concerned that you will overturn Roe, or basically strip it of all meaning so that it becomes a nullity. Because you will have these cases that, as you say, you know, the open question is how far the Supreme Court will go in letting states put limits on abortion. So that is why a lot of people are very concerned about your views, as articulated pre-nomination which convinced Senator Hawley you met his test. This morning, Senator Feinstein asked you a question about the Supreme Court's 2015 decision (Inaudible). A case in which the court recognized the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and I was disappointed that you wouldn't give a direct answer whether you agreed with the majority in that case or if you instead agree with your mentor, Justice Scalia, that no such right exists in the Constitution. So even though you didn't give a direct answer, I think your response did speak volumes. Not once but twice. You used the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community. And let me make clear. A sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term. It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not. Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity, that sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable, was a key part of the majority's opinion in Obergefell, which by the way, Scalia did not agree with. So if it is your view that sexual orientation is merely a preference, as you noted, then the LGBTQ community should be rightly concerned whether you would uphold their constitutional right to marry. I don't think they use the term sexual preference as just -- I don't think it was an accident. And one of the legacies of Justice Scalia and his particular brand of originalism is a resistance to recognizing those in the LGBTQ community as having equal rights under our Constitution. In 1996, Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in Romer v. Evans, defending a state's ability to openly discriminate against the LGBTQ community. In 2003, Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in Lawrence v. Texas, defending a state's right to criminally prosecute someone for same-sex sexual activity. Ten years later, in U.S. v. Windsor, Justice Scalia wrote another dissenting opinion, this time defending the federal government's right to deny federal recognition of same-sex marriages. And of course two years after that, in Obergefell, Justice Scalia wrote yet another dissent, and this time, he argued that there was no constitutional right to same-sex marriage. So under Justice Scalia's judicial philosophy, which you have told us is your own, states could openly discriminate against the LGBTQ community. Same-sex couples could be denied the right to get married, and they could actually be thrown in jail if they engaged in sexual intercourse. There are an estimated 11 million adults who have identified as LGBTQ living in this country. Since Obergefell was decided in 2013 -- 2015, approximately 293,000 same-sex couples have gotten married. And many of these people are rightly afraid that if you are confirmed, you adjoin with other conservative members of the court to roll back everything the LGBTQ community has gained over the past two decades and push them back into the closet. Now, two sitting justices are already calling for Obergefell to be narrowed if not outright overturned. Just last week, Justices Thomas and Alito issued a statement concerning -- concurring with the court's decision to deny Davis v. Ermold, a case involving a former Kentucky County court who refused to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples. They accused the court of -- and this is Justices Alito and Thomas. They accused the court of, quote, \"reading a right to same-sex marriage into the 14th Amendment, even though that right is found nowhere in the text.\" And these two justices signal that Obergefell is a problem that only the court can fix. So coupled with your use of the term sexual preference, coupled with your view on precedents, and that a justice's view or her own analysis of the constitutionality should overtake or overcome precedents if it's in conflict. So this is why so many people in the LGBTQ community are so concerned that you would, in fact, joined the signaling that these two Justices have already put out there that Obergefell will fall by the wayside. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Thank you. Senator Ernst. SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA):\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Judge Barrett, thank you so much for being here today with your beautiful family. Once again, we appreciate the support that you are showing to Judge Barrett by being here today. And Judge, I just want to offer you the opportunity at this point. Is there anything from earlier today that you feel you need more time to respond to? BARRETT:\u00a0 Thank you, Senator Ernst. I would like to just make a quick follow-on to some of Senator Hirono's comments. One, you know, I've said a number of times during the hearing that I can't comment or -- WATTERS:\u00a0 Welcome back to THE FIVE. We are just going to dip out quickly for a little analysis and will get right back to the hearing momentarily. We have been watching this, Brian Kilmeade for -- what is this now, six going on seven hours. I think everybody would agree that this has been a flawless performance by Amy Coney Barrett. The Democrat senators have not gone after her religion. Many people expected that. They have been respectful, but have not been able to pin her down on any major issues and give any Republican senator a chance to second think a confirmation vote. BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 Well, (Inaudible) is through the roof, Jesse, 100 percent agree. I think the decorum in which both sides have shown. Obviously, Republicans are not going to be hostile towards her. I found it educational. Dana said before the show. I was kind of embarrassed to say how much I learned during the hearing. But I learned a ton during this hearing, because it was an honest exchange of ideas. This is the two themes, recusal. We need you to recuse. In case this thing goes to the court and we can't figure out a winner between Biden and Trump, we need you out of there. And we also need you to recuse when it comes to Obamacare. And I have some illustrations of families we'll never meet and people we'll never know, which sound like wonderful people. But I just don't know. I think it's all this stuff yesterday was a bridge too far, as was today's. We're talking about law and order, the courts, and whether you belong or not. And I just thought one thing that stood out too was Senator Cornyn. Senator Cornyn asked can you show me your notes, which she held and basically was just a U.S. Senate blank sheet of paper. To be that competent to sit there and take questions from 20 senators for 30 minutes and not need notes, pretty impressive. WATTERS:\u00a0 Yes. Sotomayor and Kagan had notes during their confirmation hearings. She does not have any notes. I think everyone is very impressed by her intellect, her able -- ability to articulate, her ideas about the Constitution, and defend her positions in a way that doesn't commit herself in a way that would make people think this is how she's going to rule. DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 Well, I think we should point out that Kavanaugh and Gorsuch also had notes, and she doesn't. I am in awe. I think she is unflappable, poised. She is going to be a role model for women everywhere, young girls everywhere. She is calmly answering all of their questions. She doesn't get riled up. She obviously knows her brief very, very well. It's almost painful sometimes to watch the questions from the senators because it's embarrassing how much more she knows than they do. And I thought there are so many interesting exchanges, Jesse. But if we could pull up sound bite number five. This was a moment where she talked about how her family reacted when George Floyd was killed. And I thought maybe we could just play that in case people missed it earlier today. WATTERS:\u00a0 Let's play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARRETT:\u00a0 Given that I have two black children, it was very, very personal for my family. I had to try to explain some of this to them. I mean, my children, to this point in their lives, have had the benefit of growing up in a cocoon where they have not yet experienced hatred or violence. And for Vivian, you know, understand that there would be a risk to her brother or the son she might have one day. Of that kind of brutality has been an ongoing conversation. It's a difficult one for us, like it is for Americans all over the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO:\u00a0 You know, there are -- we should watch that again and again to understand where she's coming from. But, you know, the Democrats have tried to paint her as somebody who would create this parade of horribles, of all the things she was going to do to people who are not like her or people that are underprivileged. And I think that today what you saw. This is somebody that you would want as your neighbor and as your friend and as your judge. And she went out of her way also to say when they try to keep pinning her saying that she was critical of John Roberts. She made it very clear. She said I don't criticize anybody. I don't attack anybody individually but I talk about their ideas. I can criticize ideas. And I thought it was just a breath of fresh air. And I also learned a ton. Brian, I really did. I loved watching it. WATTERS:\u00a0 I think when she does meet Justice Roberts it could be a little awkward, the way the Democrats tried to pit them as two people against each other. Juan Williams, very, very intense questioning over Obamacare, and I think several precedents, which she was, I guess, trying to explain that she would not infuse her own views on Obamacare. And she would follow precedent and interpret the statute as written by the House and the Senate. How did you think she did answering those questions? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 Well, I think it's a lot like her notes. It's a blank slate. She won't say. She won't say what her opinions are. So I mean, you don't need notes if you just say, hey, you know what, I'm not going to tell you. WATTERS:\u00a0 But isn't that what the other liberal justices did during their hearings? WILLIAMS:\u00a0 No, not all of them. But some -- I mean, generally, I think what we've seen is things have become more polarized in our country. And as Justices come before the court -- I think this is especially the case after Bork in the late 80s that, you know, honest discussion of your policy positions and even things that you've written before. It's very difficult to get out, because people think this could be used against me to disqualify me from the court. But in the case of Amy Coney Barrett, I mean, like on abortion, I mean, does anybody have any doubt she is opposed to abortion rights in this country? She signed an ad calling for Roe to be overturned. She gave speeches. She's written letters. And in some cases, she didn't even disclose it, not only for this nomination but for previous nominations. It's been discovered now. And on the election, Jesse, you know, President Trump has said explicitly. He wants her on the court to rule in his favor in case any issues in this election come before the Supreme Court. So to my mind, wow, I mean, if Obama did something like that, who. I mean, I can see conservatives just screaming for holy murder. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, I don't think Sotomayor or Kagan recuse themselves for any issue -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS:\u00a0 No, I'm talking about this election. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS:\u00a0 We are 20 days away from an election. He's putting someone the court and saying I'm putting there so they rule in my favor. (CROSSTALK) PERINO:\u00a0 Jesse, if you wanted to play sound bite number three. WATTERS:\u00a0 I think we have that when she said that the president never discussed this with her. Let's roll that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARRETT:\u00a0 I have had no conversation with the president or any of his staff on how I might rule in that case. It would be a gross violation of judicial independence for me to make any such commitment or for me to be asked about that case and how I would rule. I also think it would be a complete violation of the independence of the judiciary for anyone to put a justice on the court as a means of obtaining a particular result. I have made no pre-commitments to anyone about how I would decide a case. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS:\u00a0 But that's what -- that's the reason that Trump said he wants her on the court. This is going to damage the court's credibility. WATTERS:\u00a0 In your opinion. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS:\u00a0 No, I'm saying -- WATTERS:\u00a0 And that's not the deal that they had. They didn't have a deal. That's the president tweeting. That has nothing to do with her or how she's going to act. WILLIAMS:\u00a0 Jesse, would you say this if this was Obama? No, you would say the court is now so politicized that we as Americans can't trust our court. WATTERS:\u00a0 No. I trust the Supreme Court. PERINO:\u00a0 He shouldn't have tweeted it. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:\u00a0 Dagen? PERINO:\u00a0 -- the president should not have tweeted that, because it did put her in a -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:\u00a0 And I think she handled that perfectly. That was a homerun. DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST:\u00a0 And here's what Amy Coney Barrett said. My personal views, my religious views are distinct from my duties as a judge, on the abortion questions and others. She adhered to the Ginsburg standard. She is honoring Ruth Bader Ginsburg. No hints, no forecasts, no previews. How many times do you want me to say that over and over again? I wanted to call out -- we are talking about her demeanor. I wanted to talk about Sheldon Whitehouse and that hypocritical monologue or lecture that he hacked up in front of her. Not asking her one question, not one. He implied that Amy Coney Barrett is not there because of her accomplishments, because of her intellect, because of how she's lived her life. But she's there because she's a pawn of dark money, hypocrite. And you know that also is? That's sexist. Let me call him out on it. Barrett kept her game face on. He lectured her. Again, not one question. Wasn't that sexist? She kept her composure. She showed her incredible fortitude, because every woman watching today knows what their reaction would've been. It would've been, like, eye roll. Ask me a question. Get on with it. They wouldn't have tolerated that, but she did. And it speaks to her character. I don't have that. I would have lost my -- (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL:\u00a0 But that -- I thought that that was notable that he sat there and lectured her for half an hour. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS:\u00a0 Dagen, if he says the federalist society has put all these judges, including Amy Coney Barrett on the court through Donald Trump -- (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL:\u00a0 Let me say one thing about that. The federal society does not endorse or oppose judicial nominees, number one. WILLIAMS:\u00a0 They gave a list to the president. MCDOWELL:\u00a0 Let me finish. I'm speaking. (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL:\u00a0 Sheldon Whitehouse was -- he refused to answer any questions in front of a House Judiciary Subcommittee about his own dark money ties. He refused, so again, hypocrite and sexist. WATTERS:\u00a0 How do you think the Democrats on the panel have conducted themselves? Feinstein, Leahy -- my opinion might have lost their fastball a little bit. Coons, Durbin, I thought, as a Democrat, probably made a more effective case. KILMEADE:\u00a0 Absolutely. But you could see the (Inaudible) towards her nomination but not to her. And you could Feinstein, I feel as though, she was entering those who said she lost her fastball. Look, at her age, it's enormous. She goes 3,000 miles every day -- I mean, ever week, to San Francisco and back, at her age, unbelievable. So she came out very strong as the Ranking Member. But the one thing I thought -- Lindsey Graham kind of nailed it in the middle. He said can I point out that everyone has been polite. Not one time have you talked over each other. And I think that that's what he wanted. That's what he asked for in the beginning. Not that they are listening to him but they did. They actually behaved this way. It's going to be firm. It's going to be edgy. There's going to be emotion, but you can be polite. The world is watching. And for once, I am watching something and don't feel like I have to take a shower. I mean, what I also note, too, is that after going through this, the real hits happen after they testify, because that's when Justice Thomas thing came forward with the whole controversy with him, and then of course, with Kavanaugh. He thought he was in the clear, and then things came out in between that and the committee vote, but having said that, I've never seen somebody more confident. And just keep in mind. If you're -- ask a former chief of staff of President Trump. He's in control of his own tweets. A lot of times, people look around in the Communications Department and say how do I deal with this? That's the same way that this -- Judge Barrett is dealing with this now. It doesn't reflect on her. And I think we all know the president of the United States is -- this is how I feel. I want to tell the world. He doesn't necessarily do things like every other president. And I think we should stop pretending as if we are surprised when it doesn't happen. WATTERS:\u00a0 Yeah. Dana, I do want to agree with you. I was really blown away by Amy Coney Barrett today. She's got, you know, bright eyes. She looks you directly in the eye. She is very clear. She's forthcoming but not -- she's not snobby when she uses a lot of legalese that kind of loses you, and you start losing track of what you're thinking about. She was as forthcoming as possible, direct as possible, specific as possible, and showed a sense of humor, was poised, articulate. You really can't say enough about how she conducted herself as a professional. And I thought -- maybe this has been said before. But the fact that she had her young kids there sitting silently and quietly for that entire time, shows you what a good mom she is. PERINO:\u00a0 And back to Dianne Feinstein, asked her at the beginning. She said your children are so well behaved sitting behind you. And she said I have eyes in the back of my head. What I thought was interesting is just thinking about -- you know, we've been talking about this presidential election and how many of the candidates even during the primary are much older. WATTERS:\u00a0 Yeah. PERINO:\u00a0 And here you have someone, 48 years old, a mother of young children, dealing with things that parents all across America are dealing with. She has seven children. One has special needs. Two are adopted. One wants to be a lawyer. Another wants to be a writer. She's trying to manage all of this. She talked about having to do remote learning at home. And that they would basically decide it, she and her husband, divide and conquer. And that's how they were going to get it done. And I think I don't even run errands. Like, she is running circles around everybody. And, you know, women often ask can you have it all? And no, you can't have it all at once. But wow, she can multitask and is so supported by her husband. That to me is a really good thing to see. And Jesse, if we have time, I do think that this -- OK. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:\u00a0 Joni Ernst is now asking some questions of Amy Coney Barrett. Let's listen in. BARRETT:\u00a0 Well, a statute in this context, in the context of a chevron-type challenge to agencies and the agencies -- an agency's interpretation of it. You would interpret the statute in the same way that you would interpret any other statute. So I as I was talking with Senator Sasse about earlier. My own approach to it would be textualism. And so in my approach to language, the intent of the statute is best expressed through the words. So looking at what the words -- what communicate to a skilled user of the language. ERNST:\u00a0 Very good. Well, I appreciate it. We do have a little bit of time remaining. So again, I just want to thank you. I want to thank your family very much for lending their support to you through this process. It can be a bit gruelling. But I do have to say, though, your temperament throughout the entire hearing has been truly commendable. So thank you so much. I look forward to working with you further. And with that, Mr. Chair, I will reserve my time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Thank you, Senator Ernst. Judge, are you OK to do two more? BARRETT:\u00a0 Sure. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 So Senator Booker, Senator Crapo, then we'll take a 20 minute break to grab a bite to eat and finish up. Senator Booker. SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ):\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, your honor. BARRETT:\u00a0 Hi, Senator. BOOKER:\u00a0 So I spoke yesterday. And I appreciate the attention which you gave me, talking about how this is not a normal time. And I want to reiterate that one more time as cogently as I can, because this is something like we've just never seen before in history of the United States. We are not just days away from Election Day. But people are actually voting right now, close to a million people in my state have already voted and about 10 million people voted nationally. The only other time a Supreme Court nomination hearing happened this close to an election was, as you probably know, was under President Lincoln, who declined to offer a nomination before the election. But we are in the midst of an ongoing election right now at a very contentious time in our democracy. It's probably not normal also, because people are already speaking in this election. And it seems like we are rushing through this process when many of my colleagues on this committee said just four years ago that we should not proceed to fill a vacancy that opened 269 days before an election. In the words of some of my colleagues, including the chairman, was to use our words against us, we would not do exactly what we are doing right now. It's also not normal, clearly, because we are in the middle of a pandemic. And we have tens of thousands of new COVID infections every single day, widespread food insecurity like we haven't seen these kinds of food lines in my lifetime, I don't think. People across our country are struggling. And unfortunately, we see that we are right now not dealing with this crisis. We are instead, literally, having closed the Senate virtually. And the only proceedings that are being allowed to go forward are not the issues of helping people who are struggling but dealing with this. And it's not normal that we have a president who has repeatedly attacked the legitimacy of our institutions, so much so. And I've never seen something like this in my lifetime that his former cabinet members, his former chief of staff, all talk about the danger he represents to the country we all love. In fact, probably one of the most respected person on both sides of the aisle, General Mattis, who served as our Secretary of Defense, went as far as to say a man who has been very reserved in his comments. That Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy. We are at a time that the legitimacy of our institutions are at stake. And it's not normal that the president would further cast a shadow over your nomination as well as the independence of the court by saying he would only nominate justices who would tear down Roe V. Wade, who would overturn ACA. And it's not normal amidst this all. And again, something that I find hard to believe that we are talking about is that we have a president who cannot commit himself to the peaceful transfer of power. Now, in the light of this abnormality, most Americans think we should wait on your nomination. It's an illegitimate process. Most Americans think that we should wait. Today -- and I appreciate you not following the news, but 90 of your fellow faculty members from Notre Dame wrote an open letter calling on you, for the sake of our democracy. They didn't speak to whether you are right or left or your judicial philosophy or qualifications. They wrote an impassioned letter for the sake of our democracy. They publicly issued a statement asking that your nomination. That you pull yourself -- withdraw from this nomination process and have it be halted until after the November election. This is not normal. And again, the overwhelming majority of Americans want to wait, but my colleagues here are not listening. And so I'm going to ask you some questions that if you had told me five years ago that would be questions asked at a Supreme Court nomination hearing. I would've thought they wouldn't be possible. But unfortunately, I think they are necessary to ask you. And I hope that you will give me direct answers. The first one, you've already spoken towards issues of racism and how you deplore it. But I want to just ask you very simply. And I imagine you'll give me very a short, resolute answer. But you condemn white supremacy, correct? BARRETT: \u00a0Yes. BOOKER:\u00a0 Thank you. I'm glad to see that you said that. I wish our president would say that so resolutely, unequivocally as well. But we are at a time that Americans are literally fearful, because their president cannot do that in a resolute manner in which you did. I'm sorry that that question had to even be asked at this time. Here's another one. Do you believe that every president should make a commitment unequivocally and resolutely to the peaceful transfer of power? BARRETT:\u00a0 Well, Senator that seems to me to be pulling me in a little bit into this question of whether the president has said that he would not peacefully leave office. And so to the extent that this is a political controversy right now, as a judge, I want to stay out of it. And I don't want to express a view on -- BOOKER:\u00a0 So Judge, I appreciate what you've said about respecting our founding fathers, about originalism. It's remarkable that we are at a place right now that this is becoming a question and a topic. But I'm asking you in light of our founding fathers, in light of our traditions, in light that everyone who serves in that office has sworn an oath where they \"swear to preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of United States.\" I'm just asking you, should a president commit themselves, like our founding fathers, I think, have a clear intention, like the grace that George Washington showed, to the peaceful transfer of power? Is that something that presidents should be able to do? BARRETT: Well, one of the beauties of America from the beginning of the Republic is that we have had peaceful transfers of power, and that disappointed voters have accepted the new leaders that come into office. And that's not true in every country. And I think it is part of the genius of our Constitution, and the good faith and goodwill of the American people that we haven't had the situations that have arisen in so many other countries where there have been -- where those issues have been present. BOOKER: Thank you, Your Honor. Do you think that the President has the power to pardon himself for any past or future crimes he have made -- he may have committed against the United States of America? BARRETT: Well, Senator Booker, that would be a legal question. That would be a constitutional question. And so in keeping with my obligation not to give hints, previews, or forecasts of how I would resolve the case, that's not one that I can answer. BOOKER: Well, I think I agree with you that it is an issue right now, something I never thought would be an issue before, but it is an issue that our President may intend to pardon himself for future crimes or past crimes. If a president is personally responsible for several hundred million dollars in debt while he's in office, potentially to foreign entities, do you think he has a responsibility to disclose who his lenders are especially given the Emoluments Clause? BARRETT: Well, Senator, there's litigation about the Emoluments Clause. I think it was in the Fourth Circuit. I don't know where it stands, but that clearly is an issue that's being litigated and one present in courts is not one on which I can offer an opinion. BOOKER: Thank you. I think it's disturbing that we're having this conversation. I think it's disturbing that we have a president that has brought what should be settled in the minds of most Americans. Presidents should reveal what their debts are, especially if they're to foreign nations. Presidents should not be able to pardon themselves for future crimes. Presidents should condemn white supremacy. Presidents should commit themselves to a peaceful transfer of power. Judge Barrett, you've seen a lot of my colleagues and I put up pictures of people in this room and the stories we've told, and I've appreciated the way you've listened. It's not a stretch to understand why a lot of Americans are afraid right now. All we have to do is look at the statements and actions of my Republican colleagues, the Republican Party platform, and the president who nominated you, and even some of your own words which have been read by my previous colleagues around the Affordable Care Act. President Trump who nominated you for this vacancy has not only explicitly stated that the Supreme Court should overturn the Affordable Care Act, but he promised that he would nominate a judge who would \"do the right thing,\" unlike Bush's appointee, John Roberts, on ObamaCare. The President has tried to do this legislatively. He's tried to do it administratively. He's failed time and time again. But he's promised over and over again, to tear down the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, all of my Republican colleagues on this committee except for one has voted to overturn the Affordable Care Act because House and Senate Republicans have tried to do it 70 times. The one Republican who did not was an attorney general who joined 20 state attorney generals who sued to overturn the Affordable Care Act. You yourself said, and now I will quote you, that justice -- \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its pausing -- plausible meaning to save the statue.\" The same Chief Justice Roberts that Trump implied didn't do the right thing. And so, Judge Barrett, you have said that if you were on the court, you will hear and consider the arguments from both sides. I was actually very interested when you said that you would put your family members in the shoes of litigants on both sides. Given all that you've heard said over and over again about the intentions to tear away the Affordable Care Act and the Affordable Care Act, given what you've heard about the people who rely on it, given the commitment, you know, of President Trump to set explicitly to only appoint judges who would overturn the ACA, is it unreasonable for people to fear, putting yourself in the shoes of people, is it unreasonable for the people that have been up here in their pictures -- isn't unreasonable for them to fear that the ACA would be overturned if you were confirmed to the court? BARRETT: Well, Senator, I want to stress to you, Senator Booker, as I've stressed to some of your colleagues today that I am my own person. I'm independent under article three. And you know, I don't take orders from the executive branch or the legislative. BOOKER: I understand that, I guess, can I restate my question because I don't think you are understanding. I'm just asking you as an act of empathy, can you understand the fears that are exhibited by the people we put up? I don't -- the two people I put up Michelle, and Merit, I don't know what their political party is. I don't know if they're going to vote for me. I'm on the ballot. I don't know. I just know that they were people that wanted their voices to be heard because they are afraid right now and what your nomination represents. All I'm asking is, can you empathize with that? Can you understand that? BARRETT: Senator, I can certainly empathize with people who are struggling, I can emphasize with people who lack health care. You know, one of the things that was so striking to me when we went to get our daughter, Vivian, from the orphanage in Haiti was the lack of access to basic things like antibiotics. And it just made me appreciate the fact that we had access to health care. So, I can certainly empathize with all of that. And with respect to the ACA, you know, should I be confirmed, and as I've said, I would consider the issue of recusal of threshold question of law and whether to hear that case. But should I be confirmed, and should I sit and hear the case, as I assured you, I would consider all the arguments on both sides. And one of the important issues in that case is whether even if the mandate has been hung unconstitutional since it was zeroed out, whether it would be consistent with the will of Congress for the whole act of fall -- it's a statutory question, not a constitutional one -- or whether the mandate could be severed out and the rest of the act stand. And so, the task of every justice who hears this case will be to look at the structure of the statute and look at its text to determine whether it was the will of Congress when they passed the ACA -- BOOKER: And Judge, I apologize, especially after the good behavior that was noted that we shouldn't be talking over each other. My time -- BARRETT: No, that's OK, Senator. BOOKER: -- my time is running quickly. BARRETT: Sure. BOOKER: I guess, I just -- as a guy who looks at justices, I was just asking you to express that you understand the fear that's in America right now. Because you've heard story after story of people who don't know if they're going to be able to afford their health care, who don't know if they will be denied insurance coverage. And I'm going to move on because of the short time. But I was just asking you is can you understand the fear giving the president that has said that they will put justice on there that will tear down the Affordable Care Act, thus taking away health care for millions of Americans. There is fear in our country right now. But I want to move now to earlier -- what Senator Durbin and you discussed. They asked about your views on racism and the role of courts in assessing - - in addressing racial justice. I was troubled that you said that racial justice and equality and I'll quote you, \"how to tackle the issue of making it better those things are policy questions.\" I think that that's the quote, how to tackle the issue or of making it better, the racial injustice. Those things are policy questions, and not for the court. The federal government's own data -- and this is -- I think you and I referenced this in our -- in our private conversation, which I appreciate. You said you were familiar with a lot of the data about the discrimination within our criminal justice system. For example, the U.S. Sentencing Commission shows that prosecutors are more -- this is the U.S. Sentencing Commission said that prosecutors are more likely to charge black defendants with offenses or carry harsh mandatory minimum sentences than similarly situated whites. Are you familiar with that -- the U.S. Sentencing Commission? BARRETT: I'm not familiar with that particulars. BOOKER: Does that surprise you? BARRETT: I mean, I don't know. Senator Booker, that seems an odd thing for me to express an opinion out. As you might -- BOOKER: I'm not asking. These are facts. These are just facts. BARRETT: As you and I -- I'm not familiar with that study. As you and I discussed, I am aware that there is evidence that there have been studies of systemic racism or implicit bias in the justice system. So, I am aware of that issue. I was not aware of -- BOOKER: You're aware of evidence that there is implicit racial bias? BARRETT: I am aware that there have been studies showing that implicit bias is present in many contexts, including in the criminal justice system. BOOKER: OK. I'm just going to read some of these other statistics because I think they're really important, and this is independent data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and black defendants again are compared with similarly situated white defendants were subject to three strikes sentencing enhancement at a significant higher rate, which on average, added 10 years two sentences. You're not familiar with that study? BARRETT: I'm not familiar with that study. BOOKER: Do such cases come before the Seventh Circuit? BARRETT: The three strikes cases? BOOKER: Yes. BARRETT: Are you talking about the three strikes -- the Prison Litigation Reform Act cases where they're struck out? Are you talking about -- BOOKER: I'm asking cases in the criminal justice and that relate to racial bias. Do they come before the court? BARRETT: So certainly, we have discrimination cases. Certainly, there are 1983 cases or title seven cases. BOOKER: I would imagine so. And in those -- in your research for those cases, you familiarize yourself with a lot of the data on the discrimination within the system? BARRETT: That -- you know, we familiarize ourselves with the arguments the parties make and the information that they put in the record. And in some cases, I have had parties submit, or it's submitted in the district court technically, and then made part of the record. BOOKER: And so, I just want to be clear, do you believe that there is, in fact, implicit racial bias in the criminal justice system? BARRETT: Well -- BOOKER: Just as a yes or no question. Do you believe, in fact, that there is implicit racial bias in the criminal justice system? BARRETT: Senator, it would be hard to imagine a system, a criminal justice system as big as ours not having any implicit bias in it. BOOKER: So, is that a yes? BARRETT: Senator, yes, I think that in our large criminal justice system, it would be inconceivable that there wasn't some implicit bias. BOOKER: OK. Over the last two years, about 121 of President Trump's judicial nominees in the federal court have said unequivocally that there is implicit racial bias within the justice system quite clearly. I'd like to turn to a opinion you wrote last year about race discrimination, Smith versus Illinois Department of Transportation. The case involved an African American traffic patrol officer who had been fired from the Illinois Department of Transportation. This employee claimed that he had been subjected to hostile work environment and that the supervisor called him the N word. But you ruled that the employee had failed to make the case that he had been fired in retaliation for his complaints about race discrimination. And now you acknowledged that quote, and I'm you -- I'm going to quote you now, \"The N word is an egregious racial epithet.\" But you went on to insist that the employee couldn't \"win simply by proving that the N word was uttered at them.\" And that he failed to show that this that his supervisors use of the N word against him \"altered the conditions of his employment and created a hostile or abusive working environment.\" And you said that even based on his own subjective experience, this black employee had, \"no evidence that his supervisors were lashing out at him because he was black.\" I'm very surprised to have to make this point at all, but even a staunch conservative like Justice Kavanaugh in my questioning of him spoke to the obvious harm here in a way that you don't seem to. He wrote in a court of appeals case that \"being called the N word by a supervisor suffices by itself to establish a racially hostile work environment.\" And you disagreed with that. Why do you believe that the law recognizes the harm that is inflicted on a black person in this country, when they are called that word by their work supervisor or by anyone really, for that matter? And all the history dredged up in that word, centuries of harm, why do you believe differently than Justice Kavanaugh? BARRETT: Well, Senator Booker, that opinion does not take a position different than Justice Kavanaugh. It expressly and wrote was written very carefully to leave open the possibility that one use of that word would be sufficient to make out a hostile work environment claim. The problem was that in that case, the evidence that the plaintiff had relied on to establish the hostile work environment involved other -- you know, he was driving the wrong way down a ramp, and then expletives were used, not the N word. And the N word was used after his termination had already begun. And he didn't argue under clear Supreme Court precedent -- I didn't make up the objective subject development. Under clear Supreme Court precedent, both are required. And he didn't say that it altered the terms of -- that's not how he pled or made his case and it was a unanimous panel decision. BOOKER: And forgive me if I'm reading your -- this case wrong, but you're saying to me he was not claiming that he had a hostile work environment and that -- and that it is in the fact pattern that the supervisor called him the N word. And that does not constitute a hostile work environment in the way that Justice Kavanaugh said clearly that it does? BARRETT: No, Senator. I think you're mischaracterizing what I said with all respect. In that opinion, the evidence that he introduced to show the hostile work environment was the use of expletives when he drove the wrong way down. He was he was hired to be a safety driver for the Illinois Department of Transportation. And he based his hostile work environment claim on the use of expletives at him based on poor work performance. That was what he relied upon. And then his termination proceedings had begun. He didn't tie the use of the N word into the evidence that he introduced for his hostile work environment claim. And so, as a panel, we were constrained to decide based on the case the plaintiff had presented before us. So, the panel very carefully wrote the opinion to make clear that it was possible for one use of the N word to be enough to establish a hostile work environment claim if it were pled that way. I'm going to turn to the AutoZone case you discussed earlier with Senator Feinstein. The initial panel of three judges that examined the case ruled against Kevin Stuckey. You were not a part of that initial panel, but you did have an opportunity to vote on whether to hear the case before the entire court. You had an opportunity to affirm the bedrock principle enshrined in Brown versus Board of Education about separate but equal, really to say that separate is inherently unequal. But you voted no. You didn't think the full court needed to examine this deliberate segregation of employees by race. But the judges on the court disagreed with you. In fact, three judges explained, we know that, \"deliberate racial segregation by his very nature has an adverse effect on the people subjected to it.\" On one of the central teachings of Brown versus Board of Education, which I know you're familiar with, is that idea of separate being inherently unequal. Why did you think that the separate but equal facilities were lawful or why didn't you see this as a practice that was worthy of closer scrutiny? BARRETT: Senator, as I said earlier to Senator Feinstein, I did not make a merits decision on that case, and I wasn't on the initial panel. The calculation of whether to take a case on bonk is different than a merits determination. So, I wasn't reaching any decision about whether title seven apply to that situation or not. Federal rule of appellate procedure, I think it's 35, that governs on bonk proceedings sets out standards, and this case didn't create an interest circuit conflict or an inter-circuit conflict. And so, I didn't think it met federal -- all my vote means is that I didn't feel like it satisfied the elevated high standard for on bonk review, not that I thought it was correct. There's a lot of deference to panels in my court. BOOKER: Right. But I mean, three judges disagreed with you. And these are judges appointed by Republican and Democrat presidents. They saw the case about separate really compelling. They thought the issue deserve closer scrutiny, and you had an opportunity to join them, but you didn't. You referred earlier to the problem of implicit racial bias in our system, this idea that despite the color of our skin, people can get a hearing people can get justice. And this denial seems to me that you disagree with the prioritization, at least, of your three colleagues. BARRETT: Senator, eight of my colleagues chose not to take the case on bonk. And the on bonk process is a different one than the merits decision- making process. To decide that case on the merits and know whether it would come out the same way, I would have had to participate in it and read the briefs and hear the arguments. BOOKER: And so, the three justices were wrong, then you disagree with your colleagues. BARRETT: The three judges who dissented, my three colleagues whom I respect very much, thought that it met the standard for on bonk review. That's a different question than the merits. And so, I did disagree with them about whether to take it on bonk. So, I was within the group of eight colleagues that decided that maybe that would be an issue we could take up in the future, but not to distort the panel decision then. BOOKER: Thank you. BARRETTS: That is a merits determination. BOOKER: Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you. I'm moving quickly. Judge Barrett, five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects the rights of same sex couples to marry. This was a Obergefell case which has been discussed today. The Court declared the constitution grants LGBTQ Americans equal dignity in the eyes of the law. Hundreds of thousands of couples have built their lives on this decision. I've married some of them myself. On that day, five years ago, the court fulfilled really that ideal of equal justice under law. And yet now, the same sex marriage is legal, we've seen efforts to try to undermine that decision. Justice Ginsburg wrote about legal rules that would, \"create two kinds of marriage, full marriage and skim milk marriage.\" I firmly believe that our laws shouldn't allow discrimination against people on the basis of who they are. I have a number of questions on this topic if I can get through them. But I wanted to offer you a further opportunity to address the issue that I don't think you've got to fully address that my colleague brought up. When you did use the term sexual preference earlier today, rather than sexual orientation, is there a difference and what is it? BARRETT: Senator, I really -- and using that word did not mean to imply that I think that, you know, that it's a matter -- not a matter of -- that it's not an immutable character or that it's solely a matter of preference. I honestly did not mean any offense or to make any statement by that. BOOKER: But by what you just said you understand about that immutable characteristic, in other words, that one's sexuality is not a preference, it is who they are. Is that what you're saying? BARRETT: Senator, I'm saying I was not trying to make any comment on it. I fully respect all the rights of the LGBT community. Obergefell is an important precedent of the court. I reject any kind of discrimination on any sort of basis. BOOKER: So, you say Obergefell decision. Well, what about your two colleagues -- excuse me, forgive me. What about Alito and Thomas who have said that the court has created a problem that only it can fix? They clearly don't see that as a precedent worth following. As you just said, Obergefell is a precedent. BARRETT: I said Obergefell -- of course, Obergefell is an -- is a precedent. It is an important precedent. As you pointed out, there are reliance interests now on Obergefell as to why Justices Alito and Thomas have called for its overruling in the recent opinion that they issued. I can't really speak to -- BOOKER: I called it a problem. Do you know what they're referring to? BARRETT: Well, Senator Booker, I don't know what Justices Thomas and Alito were thinking. You'd have to ask them. BOOKER: So, we're now seeing cases where gay and lesbian Americans are being denied equal access to social security survivor's benefits. One same sex couple in Arizona was together for 43 years, got married. One of them died six months later, and now the surviving spouse has been denied benefits, because they weren't married long enough, after 43 years together in love. Does this violate the rule of equal treatment that the Supreme Court has laid down? BARRETT: Well, in Obergefell, could you repeat the facts of this? BOOKER: They were -- they were together for 43 years. The law changed and allowed them to marry. They married. One died soon after, and they're being denied survivor benefits because they weren't married long enough, because the law wrongfully denied them that equality. BARRETT: So, that would be a legal question that would have to come up and be decided in the context of a real case. I mean, it's plain that Obergefell recognizes the full right of same sex couples to marry. But the question of what are the implications of that for benefits would be something that would come up with the court later. BOOKER: But there are some precedents. Maybe I can ask a different question. BARRETT: Sure. BOOKER: Can a hairdresser refuse to serve an interracial couples wedding because they disapprove over interracial marriages? BARRETT: Well, Loving versus Virginia follows directly from Brown, and it makes unconstitutional any attempt to prohibit or forbid interracial marriage. BOOKER: Could they refuse to serve a black couples wedding? BARRETT: Could a baker or a florist refuse to -- title seven prohibits any sort of discrimination on the basis of race by places of public accommodation. BOOKER: How about an interfaith wedding? BARRETT: Well, Senator, I feel like you're taking me down a road of hypotheticals that is going to get me into trouble here, because as you know, I can't opine on how cases would be resolved. And I've said that whether they're easy questions or hard questions, I can't do that. BOOKER: So, I'm not the lawyer that you are, but you seem to honor the precedents that are enough to protect discrimination against African Americans, interracial couples. But you stop on saying that unequivocally about people stopping on religious discrimination or the -- against the Muslim couples wedding or interfaith wedding? BARRETT: Well, Senator, I think you know, what title seven says, as I'm sure you know, as title seven prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, on the basis of sex. All I can do is say is refer to the statute. But of course, as to whether there would be evidence to show or whether any particular encounter between a customer and a florist or a baker violated title seven, that would be a case that would have to come up, you know, as I discussed with Senator Sasse with real litigants litigated on a full record. So, you're asking a series of hypotheticals. BOOKER: And so, I'm assuming that you will not respond or for the same reasons you've uttered before, you will not respond about whether a florist can refuse to serve same sex couple? BARRETT: Well, it sounds like you're on your way to talking about Masterpiece Cake Shop and some of the cases that are very hotly contested and winding their way through the court. Since I want to make sure that I'm not in a position where I'm eliciting any views that would bear on litigation that's very active. BOOKER: Well, and I guess you maybe can understand if we go back to the question that both I and Senator Hirono asked you about what you said you didn't mean to offend about whether it's a choice or not. These are about are the immutable characteristics of an individual, like their race. I just want to just close by saying the story of some folks in my home community of New Jersey. Emily Sinesse and Jen Moore. They've been together for 51 years. They've raised three children at last count and I think that that's a good way of putting it. They have 18 grandchildren and 20 great grandchildren. You know, families are. But for a long time, they had to keep their relationship and their love a secret. Finally, one same sex marriage -- one same sex marriage became legal, they got married. And thanks to the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell, they can now enjoy their full rights. Judge Barrett, you're asking United States Senate to agree to have you replaced Justice Ginsburg, which would tilt the balance of the court further to the right. Remember that it was Justice Ginsburg who warned against full marriage for some couples and skim milk marriage for others. Like so many couples in my state of New Jersey and around the country, Emily and Jen are worried about what might happen if the Supreme Court starts to peel back some of their hard-fought rights. They believe that their love should be valued by their government and equally as a love of any other people. And they believe a lot of the rights that they now enjoy which were denied in the past to African Americans even, to interracial couples. They believe that they should be able to preserve them. And so, I -- my time has expired. You've been very generous and as the chairman allowing me to go over. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to talk with you more tomorrow. BARRETT: Thank you, Senator Booker. BOOKER: Thank you very much. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you, Senator Booker. (END VIDEOTAPE) JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Senator Booker asking some very pointed questions about race and same sex marriage to Amy Coney Barrett there. Juan Williams, you heard the senator ask Amy Coney who has two adopted black children if she condemns white supremacy. Obviously, he knows the answer to that question. Why do you think he asked that question? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Because President Trump had such trouble with it. WATTERS: Did he have trouble with it? WILLIAMS: He had terrible trouble. I mean, you saw the debate, right? WATTERS: But what does it have to do with Amy Coney Barrett? She has to black adopted children. WILLIAMS: I heard you. I heard you. WATTERS: You know what the answer is going to be. I don't know. I'm glad that she said what she said. She's to be saluted for being direct. Because the president, if you recall, could not be direct. WATTERS: Right, I think he's -- WILLIAMS: But I mean, this is -- this is the power of what we just saw from Senator Booker. He said that President Trump, in fact, has cast a shadow over her nomination. So, I mean, a lot of times we don't want to say, oh, this is about her. But no, in so many ways, it's about the process, it's about the fact that Republicans blocked Merrick Garland, and they're now forcing this through in a rushed manner. It's about the fact that she has not only a record, but she has explicitly said what she thinks about abortion, what she thinks about the health care act. So, when you have this moment, Senator Booker says, well, you know, given President Trump saying he wants somebody in the court to decide the election, tell us what do you think about the constitution that says that there should be a peaceful transfer of power? That's why you got to ask these questions. It's not about her. It's about the process, which is illegitimate. WATTERS: Dagen McDowell? DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is not about President Trump today or even tomorrow. This is about Amy Coney Barrett. Say her name with me. She is a woman we've seen today of incredible compassion, intellect, and faith. She is a woman dedicated to family, church, community, country, and the law. And Senator Booker tipped his hat, didn't he? He said, your colleagues, Alito and Thomas, so we know how this is all going to end. She will be on the high court. WATTERS: Dana, the senator also mentioned a petition that did come out from Notre Dame where she -- where she taught for many, many years. You were telling us in the break about the petition. DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: So, it's a letter signed by 70 -- I think it's 77 professors at Notre Dame. None of which are in the law school, one of which teaches medieval studies, saying that they object -- you know, and this -- you've seen this kind of thing before, like nice try, guys, but that letter is not going to have any effect. I also think that the Democrats understand that she will be confirmed. She is unflappable. She has become more comfortable I think in the last nine hours. She listens intently. She doesn't fidget. She doesn't doodle. And I think that tomorrow's hearing, I think that the senators will be glad that they only have 20 minutes rather than 30 because this thing is over. WATTERS: Final thoughts, Brian Kilmeade. BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Senator Booker did his homework. I appreciate the line of questioning was different. Give him that. But that should be for the hallway interviews. Do you have empathy for people that are suffering? Absolutely. What does it have to do with this? And I understand how you feel, Juan, about, you know, should she be there, should the space be filled. But I think that ship has sailed. When I look at her, does she belong there? Keep the Trump questions out of this. Do it in the beginning with the open but don't pose him to her. She's already parried them for 20 hours. Why waste your time, your precious time with 30 minutes by bringing what you don't like about President Trump? WATTERS: Well, I don't even think they think it's a waste of time. I think they think that's the most potent use of the time because they know it's all being taken live on cable and networks and they want to get that shot in to the President. WILLIAMS: Did you see senator -- did you see Senator Graham -- did you see Senator Graham's opening statement? That was a political pitch. WATTERS: Yes, politicians are politicians. What can we say, Juan? That's it for us. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next with Bret. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": " If you've been paying attention recently, and you probably have, you've likely sensed that something profound is happening to this country right now, something that could transform what America is. You can feel it happening. STEPMOTHER OF ATLANTA COP IN RAYSHARD BROOKS SHOOTING FIRED FROM HER JOB Our leaders deny it. Officials on both sides reassure\u00a0us\u00a0they're not planning wholesale changes to the country. They're just trying to fix specific problems. A man was brutalized by police officers in Minneapolis. Another man was shot to death in the parking lot of Wendy's. Those things were bad, they are telling us, and abuses like that are what they are fighting against. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER They say we need new laws, more good faith, more attention to injustice, and that sounds right to most Americans. Americans are decent people. They want to do the right thing. Certainly, Republicans in Congress appear to believe all of this -- or maybe they're just so scared, they pretend they believe it. Either way, just Wednesday, the GOP leadership enthusiastically backed a Law Enforcement Reform Bill. They're proud of that. They seem to think that reining in the police will fix the underlying problems. And pretty soon, we can all get back to living in 2014 again. Republicans appear to believe this is a policy debate. Is anyone in power defending absolute equality under the law? If there was ever a time to remind America that we all have equal value under God, that time is right now. But no. No one in charge is saying that. Our leaders are cowards when we need them to be brave. They are muddled when we need them to think clearly. It's possible they no longer even believe in equality. But Democrats know better than that; they don't lie to themselves. They understand there is a revolution in progress. The death of George Floyd may have sparked widespread outrage -- sincere outrage -- and they may share that outrage. But they also know that what is happening now has very little to do with George Floyd or people like him. Like all revolutions, the point is to destroy the current system and replace it with something new. Or replace it with what? That's the question the rest of us should be asking right now. We should know what's coming. We know what we have now. Our current system has been in place for hundreds of years. It's based on a very simple idea: All people are created by God with equal moral value. Period. Every one of them. For that reason, and that reason alone, all Americans are treated equally under the laws of the United States. In this country, we judge you for what you do, not how you were born. That idea has been the defining principle of America since the 18th Century. It's the main reason we are the fairest society in the world. It's the reason people move here. To the extent America has failed to live up to that principle of equality, we are ashamed of it -- we should be. Equality is the most important thing we have. We should defend it. We should practice it. Now for the first time in our history, we're witnessing a broad and powerful attack on the principle of equality. Daily, we are told that all people are not in fact created equal. Some were born with moral stain, others were not. Some Americans are guilty, some are innocent. Nothing can change this because it was all determined at birth. All we can do is respond accordingly. People in favored\u00a0groups must be held to one standard. Those in disfavored groups, the morally tainted ones, must be held to another standard. The country retains one set of laws mostly for the sake of formality. But we must apply those laws in very different ways, according to the DNA and the background of the accused. If that sounds familiar, it's because this kind of system we just described -- this system based on heredity and blood\u00a0guilt -- has been very common in history. It was the rule in feudal Europe, for example, and the totalitarian regimes on that continent more recently. It's still in practice in parts of the world. In North Korea, children are sent to prison camps for the sins of their ancestors. And unfortunately, we have seen it here, too. You may have wondered how politicians could have justified practices as perverse as slavery and Jim Crow in a country with a constitution like ours and the answer is simple -- by arguing that not all people are created equal. Some had lesser moral value from birth. That's what they said. Those people carried the stain of sin with them. You are allowed to treat them differently based on who they were. The promise of absolute equality under the law is all we have. Laws are designed to protect the weak, not the strong. At the time, many understood that this was a lie. Slavery persisted for hundreds of years, but there\u00a0were always some in authority who considered it evil. Not evil simply because it was abusive, which of course it was, but because the existence of it violated the central principle of this country. And they were\u00a0right. Where are those people now? Look around. Is anyone in power defending absolute equality under the law? If there was ever a time to remind America that we all have equal value under God, that time is right now. But no. No one in charge is saying that. Our leaders are cowards when we need them to be brave. They are muddled when we need them to think clearly. It's possible they no longer even believe in equality. Forty years ago, this was a middle-class country and as a result, America had strongly egalitarian values. Pretty much everyone used commercial airports and ate at McDonald's. Do you remember that? People talked without irony about their rights as citizens and taxpayers. You couldn't pay extra to jump to the head of the line at Disney World. The idea that someone like Jeffrey Epstein could beat a sex charge because he was rich would have shocked us then. We would have demanded an investigation into just how Jeffrey Epstein died. Why? Because Americans hated corruption. They saw corruption as an offense against equality. That was 40 years ago. Things were moving in the opposite direction ever since. We now accept, uncritically, the claim that some people deserve better treatment based on how they were born, and some deserve worse. This is the most poisonous and the most destructive of all ideas. Other nations understand that. Rwanda has made it a crime to make ethnic appeals during elections -- to practice identity politics -- because they know very well where that leads. Yet, identity politics is accelerating here. It shouldn't surprise you that most of the people pushing this poison are benefiting from it. They're using the recent chaos to codify dangerous trends already in progress, a permanently unequal society where some citizens are elevated and others are crushed. Winners and losers preordained by law. That's the country they're working toward. At the same time -- and this is always the tell -- they lecture you with maximum self-righteousness about how they're doing precisely the opposite of that. What they're really doing, they claim, is upholding equality under the law. \"No one is above the law,\" they scold, meaning you aren't. You are not above their laws. You must obey those laws to the letter,or you will face certain punishment. Others, meanwhile, get a pass for an entirely separate set of laws. Revolutionaries don't acknowledge universal standards. Increasingly, they admit this out loud. They're not pretending anymore. In California, Democrats are moving to repeal Proposition 209. Proposition 209 explicitly bans racial discrimination in hiring and education. In other words, Democrats in California are now fighting for discrimination. This is not considered strange in 2020. No one even mentions it. A couple of weeks ago, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky announced plans to bring universal health insurance to his state, but not for all citizens, just for people with the right skin color. Everyone else would pay, but only certain ethnic groups would benefit. Andy Beshear is still in office. No one has tried to impeach him for suggesting this because ideas like this are everywhere now. They're totally unchallenged. This is the most divisive possible way to run a country. If you wanted to make certain that your children would hate each other, you would hold them to different standards, and they certainly would. There is a reason that racial tension is rising in this country --\u00a0it's by design. But race is not the only dividing line. The coronavirus lockdowns have nothing to do with race, with white or black,\u00a0thank God. They're probably the only thing in America right now that doesn't. Quarantines are instead scientific. They're purely a matter of public health. That's what they told us and we believed them. We sat passively as they destroyed our country's economy as they indicted Americans for trying to make a living. And then the Black Lives Matter riots started, and we learned that it was all fake. The very same officials who threatened us with arrest for going outside\u00a0urged their own voters to flood the streets. And they did, and no one was punished. How could this happen? It was such a flagrant, double standard, not even hidden, right in your face. They didn't try to explain it. They didn't bother to justify it. Why? Anyone familiar with totalitarianism regimes can tell you exactly why and what's going on. This is ritual humiliation. Forcing people to accept mistreatment is a time-tested way to subdue them. Of course, we're not treating you fairly, they're telling us. You don't deserve fairness. You deserve what you get. That's the message. And after awhile, the population accepts this. Some believe it. They blame themselves. That's the goal. But we should never accept it. The promise of absolute equality under the law is all we have. Laws are designed to protect the weak, not the strong. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At the moment, the people leading this revolution against our system are strong. That's why they're trying to subvert our laws. If they succeed, there will be nothing to protect the rest of us in this country. We cannot let them do that. In the United States of America, all of us are equal under the law. Period. Say that as loud as you can. Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on June 18, 2020. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON",

            "article_content": " The rioting, looting and wave of arson hitting cities around the nation following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police is much like the disturbances that convulsed American cities in the 1960s. Many of the riots that erupted between 1965 and 1968 were sparked by racial discrimination against African-Americans and incidents between them and police. The biggest wave of riots occurred in 1968 following the assassination of Martin Luther King, the most prominent African-American of his day in the fight for equal rights. The killing on Memorial Day this year of George Floyd, a black man unknown at the time to most Americans, sparked riots not because he was famous but because his horrific death was captured on video. A police officer knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes and three other officers failed to intervene \u2013 despite Floyd\u2019s desperate cries for help saying he could not breathe. CURTIS HILL: DEFUND POLICE IN RESPONSE TO GEORGE FLOYD KILLING? IT\u2019S AN INSANE IDEA THAT WOULD INCREASE CRIME All four officers have been fired and now face charges of second-degree murder or aiding and abetting second-degree murder in Floyd\u2019s death.s the philosopher and writer George Santayana famously said in 1905: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d And in fact, that wise observation holds true today. In some respects, we\u2019re reliving the 1960s and watching some of our leaders make the same mistakes an earlier generation of leaders made over 50 years ago during the last wave of rioting. About 70 percent of all Americans living today either weren't born or weren't old enough to know what\u00a0was going on from 1965 to 1968. So it\u2019s useful to look back and learn from what went wrong then. Between 1965 and 1968 hundreds of riots tore through U.S. cities, leaving many people dead, thousands of small businesses in ruins and the liberal urban agenda of the 1960s discredited. More and more Americans embraced \u201claw and order\u201d as a better response to the chaos. Tragically, it was residents of the riot zones \u2013 mostly African-Americans \u2013 who suffered the most. Five days after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, the first major riot erupted in the Watts district of Los Angeles. It began after a California Highway Patrol officer arrested an African-American man for driving while intoxicated. Accounts vary over whether there was excessive force used when the man resisted arrest. Subsequent riots also occurred as a result of incidents involving the police. On July 23, 1967, after police raided an illegal after-hours bar in Detroit, the Motor City exploded. Some 2,500 businesses were looted, nearly 1,500 buildings were torched, 43 people were killed and 342 people were injured. Perhaps most well-remembered are the riots that followed Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination the following year. Rioting took place in more than 100 cities, including the nation\u2019s capital. Property damage in Washington alone was estimated at $27 million \u2013 more than $204 million in today\u2019s dollars. The 1960s riots occurred against a backdrop of civil rights protests. African-Americans had legitimate complaints about schooling, employment discrimination and poor housing, among other concerns. Yet black people in the riot zones overwhelmingly opposed what was going on. In a Harris\u00a0poll\u00a0taken in the aftermath of the Detroit riot, 68 percent of African-Americans surveyed characterized the looters as \u201ccriminals.\u201d The same percentage felt that violence hurt the cause of civil rights. Many white liberals, on the other hand, conflated the riots with civil rights protests, failing to make any distinction. In a\u00a0March 1969 interview, White House aide Harry McPherson \u2013 President Johnson\u2019s favorite speechwriter \u2013 recalled that the White House would issue statements denouncing rioters but adding \u201c'an apologetic 'Of course, we understand why you rioted. . ..' It was that ambivalence of the liberal.'\" Today\u2019s liberals seem to have lost any such ambivalence. Yet those on the left have much to lose if Americans reject the romanticizing of violence \u2013 just as liberals lost in 1968 with the election of \u201claw-and-order\u201d Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon. Just last week, President Trump said that \u201cI am the president of law and order.\u201d He no doubt hopes to ride to reelection on that label, just as Nixon was first elected 52 years ago. That\u2019s why today\u2019s liberals would be wise to listen to former President Barack Obama, who wrote June 1 in the online magazine,\u00a0Medium:\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it. If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves.\u201d One of the saddest outcomes of riots is the destruction of small mom-and-pop businesses that have little chance of starting over. The riots of the 1960s involved the looting of at least 10,000 businesses, according to research in the African-American studies journal\u00a0Phylon. With the riots in the 1960s and also since Floyd\u2019s death rationalized as \u201cprotest\u201d \u2013 and the police for several days told to stand down in many communities (\u201cit is better to let them loot than shoot,\u201d the saying goes) \u2013 merchants watched as their stores were emptied and then often burned. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Rioters were and still are in some places granted a moral holiday. Their neighbors \u2013 the merchants and their customers \u2013 are forced to pay the price. Then and now, store employees lost their jobs, merchants their livelihoods, and consumers the convenience of nearby places to shop. One difference today: rioters loot Walmart and torch Target \u2013 discount chains that didn\u2019t operate in black neighborhoods in the 1960s. Civil rights activists complained then that the \u201cpoor paid more\u201d because chain stores avoided the inner city. The looting of Target, headquartered in George Floyd\u2019s Minneapolis, is thus an ironic demonstration of the progress made in consumer choices for residents of low-income neighborhoods. But as they say, no good deed goes unpunished. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It\u2019s time to retire the worn-out riot ideology of the 1960s. Riots are not a form of protest; indeed, they hurt the cause of civil rights and are a source of injustice to those who suffer from the looting and arson. Few of those living in the midst of the riots share the easy illusions of those who hammer the unrest into a civil rights framework. If it is too much to ask President Trump to speak eloquently on the subject, we need to hear from those like President Obama and the residents themselves who cry out for this not to happen again.",

            "article_content": " I celebrated last New Year\u2019s Eve in Ghana, Africa. I\u2019d grown up poor with a mom addicted to drugs but started this decade far from the South Side of Chicago and amongst some of the most \u201celite\u201d black people in the world. With me was one of my best friends, Nate, an executive for one of the largest technology companies in the world and a former Obama administration attorney; his brother-in-law, a neurosurgeon who graduated from Harvard; a billionaire whose house party we all attended to ring in 2020; and many Hollywood celebrities, including Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker. This was to be the start of the best year of our lives. FORMER REP. ALLEN WEST: JULY 4TH HAS SPECIAL MEANING FOR ME AS A BLACK MAN WHO OVERCAME DISCRIMINATION Back home in the U.S., African-Americans were experiencing the best economy we have ever seen: Unemployment for our racial group was the lowest in recorded history, black wages were rapidly increasing for the first time in decades, and people who\u2019d been out of work long-term were being hired and suddenly able to take their families on vacations for the first time in years. President Trump\u2019s policies made it possible. Tax cuts and rocketing GDP growth meant companies were feeling financially stable for the first time in a decade and public confidence in our economy had never been higher. Trump\u2019s reelection was on cruise control. Even Democrats were willing to admit that the chances of Trump losing were slim. No one could have predicted what would happen next. Since COVID-19, almost every economic benefit of the Trump presidency has evaporated. Unemployment has surged again \u2013 reaching numbers closer to the end of the Great Depression \u2013 and has impacted, as it has in every U.S. downturn, African-Americans the most. All this is coupled with the issues of race that still plagues our country and the media\u2019s incessant narratives of Trump \u201cbeing racist.\u201d In some cases, these wounds have been self-inflicted, as with Trump\u2019s recent retweeting of a white-supremacist video that used racist language, which the president later claimed he hadn\u2019t heard. The black vote will be the swing vote this year. And right now, it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s for the taking. This is despite Biden\u2019s history, which is riddled with policies that have historically and devastatingly disenfranchised African-Americans. For example, the 1994 crime law, which Biden helped author when he was a senator, incentivized local police departments to lock up as many black people as possible, creating\u00a0mass incarceration\u00a0of African Americans, along with more prison cells and more aggressive policing. In addition, Biden was responsible for a provision in the 1986 crack law that came to be viewed as one of the most racially slanted sentencing policies on record: a rule that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended up\u00a0disproportionately punishing African- Americans\u00a0and sending them to prison, but sparing white Americans who typically used cocaine. We also must not forget the racially charged language Biden has used numerous times, including the notion that if you don\u2019t vote for him \u201cyou ain\u2019t black.\u201d But politicians on both sides of the aisle have used offensive language, and what counts more, in my view, are deeds rather than words. I personally do not agree with everything President Trump says or does, and I often find myself on national TV as a conservative pundit saying exactly that. But I would be lying if I didn\u2019t tell you that Trump has been one of the most impactful presidents for African-Americans from a policy perspective \u2013 and that\u2019s what matters. I often say black lives don\u2019t matter to Democrats, black votes matter to them. He supported the First Step Act, which released thousands of people from prison (90 percent of whom were black). He has promoted \u201copportunity zones\u201d that incentivized private investment into marginalized communities, and also increased federal funding to historically black colleges and universities\u00a0by 17 percent\u00a0\u2013 a total exceeding $100 million, more than any president in history. Meanwhile, the Obama administration infamously\u00a0removed a two-year Bush-administration program\u00a0that annually funded $85 million directly to these prized institutions. As I mention in my book,\u00a0\u201cTaken For Granted,\u201d\u00a0during the 2016 election Trump did something few Republicans had the courage to do \u2013 he targeted the black vote and spoke directly to African-American issues. He was not afraid of saying the \u201cwrong thing\u201d (and, yes, he sometimes did) while achieving the ultimate goal of creating real dialogue and opportunity in communities largely ignored by both parties. In return, he received only 8 percent of the black vote generally, and 12 percent of black men. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER By comparison, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney earned 6 percent of the black vote. But after three years in office, having delivered on so many issues for black voters, Trump\u2019s support among black men\u00a0had risen to 24 percent, according to one February poll. Although the polls now look bad for Trump, I often remind people that polls don\u2019t vote, and we are still four months from Election Day. At the same time, Trump cannot afford to sit on the sidelines or be complacent about the black vote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump and Republicans have delivered for the black community on tangible policies that have had a positive impact \u2013 something the Democrats never achieved. Trump needs to remind African-Americans about what he has accomplished and contrast it with Biden\u2019s record of failure, mass incarceration and racially charged language. I often say black lives don\u2019t matter to Democrats, black votes matter to them. And that party\u2019s lack of targeted policies benefiting African-Americans proves just how much they take their votes for granted.

EXCLUSIVE: The Republican National Committee (RNC)\u00a0is increasing its efforts to court Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific Americans with a new online and print ad blitz. The ads \u2013 shared first with Fox News \u2013 are being launched Monday nationally and in key\u00a0general election battleground states. The RNC says it\u2019s spending six-figures in this latest buy, which is part of the party committee\u2019s multi-year, multi-pronged effort to engage targeted communities on certain issues. The RNC highlights that the ads will be placed in English and Spanish, as well as Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian, and will appear in various publications including Indian American and historically Black newspapers. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE BIDEN-TRUMP RACE The messaging in the ads highlights how policy initiatives by Republicans and\u00a0President Trump\u00a0align with each audience\u2019s values \u2013 and the ads direct voters to the RNC\u2019s vote.gop, where they can register to vote, check their voter registration and make a plan to vote. \u201cThe RNC has made a historic and concerted effort to meet voters where they are through targeted investments in Black, Asian Pacific American, and Hispanic communities,\u201d RNC chair Ronna McDaniel told Fox News in a statement. A Republican National Committee online ad courting Black voters \u201cWe are talking with voters in their own languages, meeting with Americans of all backgrounds in their communities, and going after every vote in the home stretch of this campaign. Coupled with our latest ad buy, these unprecedented efforts to engage with minority communities will put us over the edge in closely contested battleground states, propelling President Trump and Republicans to victory,\u201d McDaniel emphasized. The ads courting African Americans spotlight that Republicans are fighting for HBCUS (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), entrepreneurship, criminal justice reform, and school choice. The ads that reach out to Hispanics highlight that Republicans are fighting for freedom, opportunity, faith, and family. And the ads courting the Asian Pacific community showcase that Republicans are fighting for access to choice in education and to economic resources, and have zero tolerance for discrimination. The RNC touts that due to their long standing on-the-ground presence in key battlegrounds this cycle, they\u2019ve built relationships with minority communities and expanded their presence nationwide. They believe that this permanent presence will \u201cpay massive dividends\u201d on Election Day on Nov. 3. Party officials say they have 15 community centers geared at engaging the Black community, 17 community centers focusing on courting the Latino community, and 8 community center dedicated to reaching out to Asian Pacific Americans. The latest Fox News national poll \u2013 conducted Oct. 3-6\u00a0 - shows Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leading the president 80%-16% among non-White voters, and the former vice president topping Trump 69%-26% among Hispanic voters.

A task force set up by\u00a0presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u00a0and Vermont\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders -- who was Biden\u2019s last remaining rival in the nomination battle -- on Wednesday released\u00a0a wide-ranging set of recommendations for the party\u2019s convention platform. And while the proposals lay out a progressive road map for the former vice president, the document falls short of the ambitious plans pushed by Sanders and other candidates during the Democratic primaries. AOC NAMED CO-CHAIR AS BIDEN AND SANDERS SET UP UNITY TASK FORCE The health care\u00a0task force spotlights ways to expand coverage by strengthening the Affordable Care Act,\u00a0which was Biden\u2019s position during the primaries,\u00a0rather than pushing for a single-payer \"Medicare-for-all\" health care system, a\u00a0signature policy goal\u00a0for Sanders and\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0that was notably absent from the document. But the climate change task force -- co-chaired by progressive\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Secretary of State John Kerry --\u00a0calls for a faster timetable to achieve net-zero carbon emissions than Biden has previously\u00a0advocated for, instead of the Ocasio-Cortez-championed Green New Deal to overhaul environmental policy, which\u00a0also was not included in the recommendations. The freshman congresswoman and member of the so-called \"Squad\" tweeted: \"I do believe that the Climate Task Force effort meaningfully & substantively improved Biden's positions.\" The panel was appointed by Biden and Sanders after the populist senator from Vermont dropped out of the race and endorsed the former vice president. Its mission --\u00a0following a primary season where the sharp policy differences between the more moderate Biden and the populist Sanders and Warren were on display --\u00a0was to find common ground in six key areas:\u00a0climate change, criminal justice reform, the economy, education, health care and immigration. \u201cI commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to Senator Sanders for working together to unite our party, and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come,\u201d Biden said in a statement. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Sanders,\u00a0in a separate\u00a0statement,\u00a0acknowledged that \u201cthe end result is not what I or my supporters would have written alone.\u201d But the senator added that \u201cthe task forces have created a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction and substantially improve the lives of working families throughout our country.\" On criminal justice reform -- which has been in the spotlight the past two months in the wake of national racial unrest following the death of George Floyd -- the proposals included a series of police reforms such as banning chokeholds, ending racial profiling\u00a0and letting abuse victims pursue civil litigation. The Democrats pledged to overhaul a police system they said has \"overpoliced and underserved Black and Brown communities.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The platform also commits the Democratic Party to support a bill that would create a commission on reparations for slavery and discrimination. As expected, the Republican National Committee took aim, accusing the task force of \u201ccopying from Bernie\u2019s 2020 campaign proposals.\u201d \u201cThe fact Joe Biden has embraced Bernie Sanders\u2019 radical agenda verbatim is proof that while Bernie may not be the one leading the Democrat Party, Biden is more than happy to be his champion in its lurch to the left,\u201d Republican National Committee rapid response director Steve Guest charged. The list of recommendations will go to the Democratic National Convention\u2019s (DNC's) platform committee to consider.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine,\" September 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST: Breaking tonight, President Trump back on the campaign trail as a readies for a rally in Nevada a little later. Hello, and welcome to JUSTICE. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. The President is crisscrossing the country with the election just over 50 days away. But late this week, I had the honor of visiting the White House and sitting down with the President of the United States for an exclusive interview on the Rose Garden patio just off the Oval Office. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PIRRO: And Mr. President, thanks so much for doing this. Joe Biden has indicated after the Woodward information came out that your handling of the coronavirus in that situation was not only despicable, but it's almost criminal. What do you say to Joe Biden? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think a statement like that is criminal because we did a much better job than he could ever have done. As you know, it was months later before he even thought the ban was a good thing and ultimately, he had to apologize for what he did. We would have lost hundreds of thousands of lives. And what I said to Woodward was actually good. I said, calm, we need calm. We don't need panic. They want me to jump up and down, and start screaming, \"Is everyone going to die? Is everyone going to die?\" That's not what leadership is about. I'm a cheerleader for the country. We need calm. That's all I've said. And by the way that was done after -- that was done after I had already banned China from coming into the country. PIRRO: Right. That was in February. So you banned January 31st. TRUMP: So, I took big steps. So Jeanine, I took tremendous steps. Everybody knew how I feel, otherwise I wouldn't be banning China. Then shortly thereafter, I banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives with each one of those bans and saved probably two or two and a half million lives by doing what we did early. PIRRO: So you say that your timing was good, but let me ask you about Bob Woodward's timing. He did this interview with you on February 7th, where you talked about how dangerous the virus was, and yet he waited until September, seven months later to announce to the American public how dangerous you said it was, was his timing good? TRUMP: Look, he is an opportunist, and not a bad guy to be honest. He is doing his thing. His first book, I didn't have anything to do with it and he wrote things that were false and untrue and I could have straightened it out. And I said, let me do it. I took quite a few phone calls, 16 phone calls or something like that and we had some good conversations, not long, but good conversations. And I don't even know if the book is good or bad. I mean, I can tell you that what this says is that I said don't panic. We don't want panic. You know, the press will make everything look bad because it's fake. The fake news. Most of it, I'd say 85 percent, unfortunately, that's the number we're up to, but I discussed with him lots of different things. I think they were very good discussions. We'll see how it comes out. But on this subject if you look, and he is actually being hit, because if he thought it was wrong, then he should have reported it early. You know, if lives were going to be lost, he should have reported it early. The truth is, he didn't think there was anything wrong with it, and I think that he thought it was surprising that the press even picked it up. It's fake news. It's all fake news. PIRRO: Well, in fact, when he called you in March, a month later, you said to him, I didn't want to cause panic. And that's precisely you know, why I, as leader, didn't go out and just say everyone is going to die. TRUMP: Well go out and look at the great leaders of the world. Winston Churchill stood on the rooftops in London, very calm making speeches, Winston Churchill. You want calmness, you know when somebody that's going to be jumping up and down. I could do that, too. I could jump up and down say, oh, this is terrible. This is terrible. We don't want strength. We want leadership and we don't want panic. PIRRO: What about the vaccine itself? Now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Gallup survey that they just did says that the acceptance of the vaccine is pretty much going along political lines. The Democrats don't want to accept it because they don't trust it, because it's coming out of your administration. TRUMP: They don't want it because they think it's going to make me look good and it wins the election for me. But we're very close to a vaccine. We also have already come out with therapeutics, if you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma. If you take a look at the things that we've come out with already and the number, we're 85 percent better in terms of fatalities. You'd look at the kind of numbers -- I don't know if you've been seeing this, but we're really rounding the corner. And this is actually without anything further than we already have, and we have some very good things out there already. In terms of, I would say, in terms of -- we can't use the word cure yet, but pretty close to a cure. You're going to be pretty close to a cure. The vaccine itself. I mean, it could come out in October, but whether it's October, November, or December it is going to come out very soon. We have great companies that are very advanced and the results are going to be very good. PIRRO: Well, you know the numbers -- you're correct, the numbers are going down and there's a question as to whether or not the lockdown works that maybe people need to get outside. And if the coronavirus cases are dropping, and Joe Biden now is coming out and saying, you know, on the advice of a scientist, I would shut it all down again. How do you think that's going to work for him? TRUMP: Well, it would be a disaster and we're setting records on job production. You know, we are 10.4 million for the last four months. Nobody has ever seen numbers like this. We're sending records by millions and millions of jobs. The country is coming back. It's a super V. It's beyond the V. It's a super V. Retail sales are beyond any number they were ever at. I mean, think of it, we're doing numbers now. As we're rounding I think the final turn, and that's with, without, it doesn't matter -- with or without. Now having the vaccine is great. It's going to happen very soon. It could happen in October. It could very well happen in October, but we're rounding the turn on the virus. They have to open up. It's only the Democrats that are closed and in my opinion, they are closed for political reasons. You have North Carolina. You have Michigan. You have a couple of other states that are closed -- New York, I mean, look at New York what they're doing in New York, that poor city with the restaurants. You can't go to a restaurant. It is like a ghost town. What they've done to New York and people are leaving is disgraceful between Cuomo and de Blasio, that combination, I've never seen anything like it in my life. It's like -- look, coming from New York, it is a very sad thing to witness. But we have to open up our states, totally open them. They are keeping them closed because they want on November 3rd, they want to have the numbers as bad as possible. Based on the numbers that you're seeing, it is not even affecting this, but probably it would be better if these states were open. Forget about numbers though. The people that are inside those lockdowns, they're suffering between depression, losing their jobs, drugs, alcohol, and all of the different things that are happening to those people, that's causing much more damage than the virus itself. PIRRO: Well, what's interesting you mentioned North Carolina, voting has already started in North Carolina. They are on lockdown. How do you think that impacts people who want to vote for you? TRUMP: Well, look, I like people to go out and vote, but if they want to sign something, you know, you have solicited and unsolicited ballots. PIRRO: Right, mail-in. TRUMP: In the country, they're going to send out 80 million unsolicited. In other words, people that don't even know what a ballot is, all of a sudden, here comes a ballot. Now, we don't even know if the people are going to get it. That's my problem. Supposedly, they're not sending them to Republican neighborhoods. Supposedly, they're not sending them to wherever or supposing the people aren't giving them back, or they go out and they harvest them. Somebody could be -- either way. But the Democrats seem to do that. I mean, they played that game for a long time. PIRRO: Yes, I prosecuted those cases. TRUMP: Well, you might have been prosecute a lot more. PIRRO: I am familiar with it. TRUMP: The fact is they are playing very dirty. Eighty million ballots. We never had any number like that anywhere close to that and you're going to see a mess on election night that's going to be -- it's going to be legendary, and all they have to do is say, go out and vote or request a ballot. Get what's called a solicited ballot where or absentee. A lot of people use the word absentee. Get an absentee ballot where you request it, it comes to you, you vote and you send it back. That's different. But they're just sending out all over, they are sending out 80 million ballots. PIRRO: Well, they are generic and a lot of people don't know what to do with them. A lot of people have moved, a lot of people have died, the registration rolls -- a lot of them haven't been purged. It's a whole problem. TRUMP: How about signatures? They don't even want to have signatures. PIRRO: They're not confirming. TRUMP: They don't want to have signatures verified. Where are they sending them? Who are they sending them to? Who's sending them back? Who's sending them back? It's a very -- it's so unconstitutional. It's so dishonest. And you have states that can't even do small elections now. PIRRO: So what can you do about it? TRUMP: Well, we are in courts and many, many courts right now, and hopefully the courts are going to decide because if they don't, you're going to have one hell of a mess on election night. PIRRO: So you talked about election night, I want to talk about election night also. But it brings me to the issue of law and order. And you, when you ran in 2016, you were the law and order candidate. It's almost prescient to think that four years later, that is one of the main issues. So we've got this anarchy going on in the streets. We've got towns run by - - and states run by Democrat governors and mayors who are refusing to allow the National Guards to come in. There are people in those cities and states who want order to come in, but you can't go in unless they request your help. TRUMP: That's right. Every -- PIRRO: What are you going to do -- let's say there are threats? They say that they're going to threaten riots if they lose on election night, assuming we get a winner on election night. What are you going to do? TRUMP: We'll put them down very quickly. PIRRO: How are you going to do that? TRUMP: We can do that. We have the right to do that. We have the power to do that if we want. Look, it is called insurrection. We just send in and we do it very easy. I mean, it's very easy. I'd rather than do that because there's no reason for it. But if we had to do, we'd do that and put it down within minutes, within minutes. Minneapolis, they were having problems. We sent into the National Guard, within a half an hour. That was the end of the problem. It all went away. PIRRO: Kenosha. TRUMP: You look at Kenosha, look at the problems they had. In fact, the Sheriffs there, the Police Chief, they're all on my side, a hundred percent. Law enforcement all over the country is on my side. And I will say this, look, we have even with the horrible things that are going on in New York and Chicago, run by -- all run by Democrats, everything we're talking about, you know, is run by Democrats. We're not talking about one Republican place. It's all run by Democrats, even the Police Chiefs, they're all quitting all over the country. PIRRO: Yes. TRUMP: Every single one. I think I saw 15 or 20, every single one of them is from a Democrat City. Before China sent us the plague, before the plague came in, we had the best crime numbers in history. When the plague came, it changed things. Let's face it, it changed things. But all of the problems are in Democrat-run cities. They are badly run. The taxes are too much. They want to defend their police. Biden is all in that. He hasn't still, to this day, used the term law and order. He is afraid to use the term because he is going to lose. He would lose the radical left supporters that he has got if they even show up for him because there's a question as to whether or not they're going to show up. But they don't want to talk about law and order. One other thing, you have a lot of people living in the suburbs. You know it well, you live in Westchester, and you know it well. I ended a rule on regulation where low income housing has been forced into the suburbs. And this has been going on for a long time, but especially so under Biden and Obama. I ended it. I terminated it. It is not going to happen anymore, unless, I'm not here in which case they are going to reinstitute it worse. So the suburbs are not going to have these projects forced into them. Now, who in the suburbs is not going to vote for me? They're going to make the projects bigger and better. They are putting Cory Booker in charge. I mean, one of the most liberal. The most liberal is Kamala. But Cory is right there and he is going to be in charge of building projects in the suburbs. You're going to destroy your suburbs. It's already happening because you see what's going on. You see what they've done. They take over the zoning and they force projects -- projects -- really terrible situations. PIRRO: So the cities are being destroyed and the combination of lawlessness and the pandemic shut down New York City and now the suburbs. But you know -- TRUMP: Well, the suburbs are going to be next. PIRRO: Yes. TRUMP: Yes, the suburbs, these people, these same protesters, but they're not protesters. They're anarchists. They're agitators. They are rioters. PIRRO: Who are they? TRUMP: They are people that in many cases are paid. PIRRO: By whom? TRUMP: And then there are stupid kids. PIRRO: Who is paying them? TRUMP: People that we're looking at right now. We're looking at them right now. PIRRO: Can you tell me? TRUMP: No, not yet, but you'll be finding out pretty soon. Look, they are stupid people, too, because they'll be overthrown as soon as they get their wish. These people don't respect them. They just using their money. These are super liberal people that have money and they're helping these anarchists and their agitators and they are dangerous. Did you see what happened over the weekend with the people walking up to a restaurant and grabbing the steak off the plate? PIRRO: The food and -- TRUMP: And biting the steak and then dropping it. Two elderly people having dinner at a restaurant, and they walk in and they take a steak and they take the potato and eat it. PIRRO: And that's exactly the problem. Now, you're waiting to be asked in. When does that change? When do you cross the Rubicon? TRUMP: Well in Kenosha, they asked me in. PIRRO: Right. TRUMP: And we did a job like nobody has ever seen before. PIRRO: But if they don't ask you in, there are American people who want you to. TRUMP: I mean, I am not allowed to do it. Unless you do insurrection, in which case, it's just not big enough for insurrection. PIRRO: You won't do insurrection before the election? TRUMP: You don't need it. You don't need it. PIRRO: Not yet. TRUMP: Oh, I'd be willing to do it in a heartbeat if you needed it, but we don't need it. Our National Guard -- PIRRO: When do you need it? TRUMP: Our National Guard is so good and so tough. PIRRO: But nobody asks. TRUMP: And by the way, police departments in places that we are talking about -- Seattle, we were going into Seattle and they solved the problem the night before we got there. We were getting ready to go. PIRRO: That's right. TRUMP: They heard we were going in. PIRRO: Did you hear Ted Wheeler's numbers? Like 20 percent in Portland. TRUMP: Ted Wheeler is a disaster. He's a laughingstock. He went out to protest with the so-called agitators, and they were going to destroy him. They were going to beat him up badly. He fortunately had security, but they were going to beat him up badly. The man is a disaster. If he would say, come in to Portland. Within a half an hour, the whole thing would be solved. PIRRO: But he is not going to say that. TRUMP: The Governor has gotten closer. Look what's going on out there? PIRRO: That's Kate Brown. TRUMP: The Governor has gotten closer. I spoke to the Governor two days ago. PIRRO: Good. TRUMP: They're arresting a lot of people. Now, we sent in the U.S. Marshals for the killer -- the man that killed the young man on the street. He shot him. I mean, it was cold blood. Cold blooded killed him. He didn't like his hat or he didn't like something and it wasn't a Trump hat. PIRRO: Right. It was peaceful, it was Prayer -- TRUMP: It was a lot. It was a religious hat. PIRRO: Right. TRUMP: And he shot him cold blood. Two and a half days went, when are you going to go get him? And the U.S. Marshals went in to get him. And in a short period of time, they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal. PIRRO: Part of the -- TRUMP: And the U.S. Marshals killed him and I will tell you something, that's the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this. There can't be guys standing up that want to fight. They want to fight, they want to fight. You can't throw bricks at people with shields. PIRRO: But the problem, Mr. President, you and I both agree, the problem is there are now prosecutors who are not prosecuting the protesters. This is like at grassroots level of being funded by socialists, who are now electing people like I used to prosecute crime, they're letting them go. TRUMP: So what's going to happen and this is a shame. You're going to have a backlash, like you've never seen if these people don't stop, because you have very smart, very tough people that aren't going to take it anymore. And once they say we're not going to take it anymore, it's going to end in a very vicious backlash and that's a terrible thought. PIRRO: How does it end? (END VIDEOTAPE) PIRRO: And that's the question. How can we stop all this violence and unrest once and for all? President Trump's important answer plus his thoughts on the Nobel Peace Prize and his answer on how he is preparing to face Joe Biden in the first debate just 10 days away. Part 2 of my exclusive sit down at the White House's next. Stay with JUSTICE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PIRRO: Welcome back to JUSTICE. In Part 2 of my exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House, as anarchy and violence continue to burn many of our beloved cities to the ground, I was left with one critical question for the President. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PIRRO: How does it end? TRUMP: We're not there yet, but we have people that are very angry. You start seeing them, the trucks come in and this comes in and that, all of a sudden you're going to see a backlash, the likes of which you haven't seen in many, many years, because people aren't going to take it. You know, a lot of people, this is all a left move and not a right movement. PIRRO: Right. TRUMP: A lot of people on the right are sitting home watching a television set looking at Kenosha and looking at Chicago where they shoot people and kill people by the dozens every week. It's not even believable. But they say -- they look at it and they say, I'm not going to allow that to happen in my country. PIRRO: Two questions, Nobel Peace Prize, congratulations. You've been nominated for something very significant, the peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, other Arab countries to follow. I was researching Barack Obama in 2009 when he got the Peace Prize. Nobody could point to anything he had done. He didn't even have time to do anything. TRUMP: He did very little in eight years and much of what he has done, as you know, I've terminated. I got rid of the individual mandate, which knocked out Obamacare. We took out the individual mandate, which is the single most unpopular aspect of Obamacare, it was a disaster. But that essentially gutted Obamacare. Most of the things -- many of the things he did, we've taken out. One of the things we're doing right now, I just got to report, 311 miles of wall that has made such an unbelievable difference on our southern border. We're doing so well with that and immigration. PIRRO: You think you'll get the Peace Prize? TRUMP: I don't know. Look, I've done the job. We signed a transaction. There's actually going to be -- the ceremony is taking place next week. I hope you can come. And it's going to be UAE highly respected, the leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected and Israel is signing. This is first time in many, many decades that anything like this has happened. I can tell you that other countries are going to be signing on to it. We're going to sign a lot of countries in the Middle East. You might have peace in the Middle East going a much different route. The biggest thing that impeded us was that horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. It was the worst deal. He paid them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. How do you approve -- that's when I realized the presidency is very powerful, when you can approve $1.8 billion in cash -- cash -- big plane loads of cash going to people that they have no idea who it is. So they did a terrible job and we're doing a great job. I think we can say that with great security. PIRRO: Last question. Debates, two weeks. You're not doing the traditional prep where somebody stands in where Joe Biden does. How do you think he's going to do? TRUMP: I think I'll do it the same way I did it last time basically. It's -- you know, sometimes like Romney was so bad on the debates and he studied for three weeks. He locked himself in a cabin. He was so crammed full of information. PIRRO: He couldn't get it out. TRUMP: When they asked him a question, he couldn't speak. Okay, he should have won that race so easily. But I mean, you were dealing with a failed President, because his first four years were total failure, Obama, but -- so, you know, you have to be loose and you have to be able to do it. And the debates worked out well, for me. Debates have worked out well for me. I don't know what's going to show up with Biden. I mean, I see different guys. I see a Biden that really tied Bernie. You know, everyone thought he was going to be killed by Bernie and it was a tie. It was nothing. It wasn't Winston Churchill, but it was fine. But I've also seen him in some of the other debates where he wasn't even coherent. He couldn't utter -- I mean he turned back -- PIRRO: How do you think he goes from incoherent to coherent? TRUMP: I think there's probably -- possibly drugs involved. That's what I hear. I mean, there's possibly drugs. I don't know how you can go from being so bad where you can't even get out a sentence. I mean, you saw some of those debates with the large number of people on the stage. He was -- I mean, I used to say, how is it possible that he can even go forward? And the only won because Elizabeth Warren didn't drop out. Had she dropped out, Bernie would have won Super Tuesday every state and you would have had Bernie instead of Biden. PIRRO: All right. TRUMP: But I like it the way it is. PIRRO: Sure do. I appreciate your time, Mr. President. Thank you so much. TRUMP: Thank you, Jeanine. Your show is great. PIRRO: I know how precious this is. TRUMP: Well, your show is great. We appreciate it very much. PIRRO: Thank you. TRUMP: Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) PIRRO: My thanks to President Trump and his staff at the White House for welcoming us this week. And next, live reaction to my exclusive interview, Dan Bongino and Leo Terrell. They've been listening and they're standing by, so make sure you do, too. JUSTICE is back with Leo and Dan in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York. President Trump getting ready to try his luck with supporters in Nevada tonight on this Saturday. He had another stop in a jam packed schedule, which is 51 days until the election. The President will soon be holding a rally in the town of Minden. The rally had originally been planned in Reno, but coronavirus restrictions there forced the campaign to adapt. Minden has a population of just over 3,000, but tonight, Trump supporters are flooding into this small rural town by the thousands. You can see it there. Back in 2016, the President lost Nevada to Hillary Clinton by just two percentage points. And this time around Democratic candidate Joe Biden is leading in the polls. You can of course stream the rally live on http://foxnews.com and on the FOX News YouTube channel. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE. For all of your headlines, log on to http://foxnews.com. Enjoy your night. PIRRO: You just heard my exclusive interview with President Trump. A lot to discuss with my panel. So let's jump right into it. FOX News contributor, Dan Bongino along with Civil Rights attorney podcast host, Leo Terrell join me now. All right guys, let's talk about law and order. It's our favorite topic, isn't it? The President when I asked him about what he would do on election night should there be as has been threatened and reported, riots. What would he do? And he said, it's called insurrection. What do you think of that Dan? Sorry. DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the Insurrection Act is one of those tools that was invoked by George H.W. Bush at the LA riots. It's not -- you know, it's not something from another planet. It's one of the tools he has. He also has probably 100,000 plus Federal agents, so probably they will all be on duty on Election Night, and the reason, Judge is because the left is super violent. I mean, they just are, the far left, I am not talking about all Democrats, obviously. But the radical left has a record from Antifa to BLM of street violence. If you were outside of the White House, the night of his acceptance speech, I was there. I was blessed enough to go and you walked outside of the gate of the White House. What you witnessed was not a protest in any way, shape, or form. You witnessed a bunch of deranged lunatics attacking people, calling my wife horrible -- and my wife who is an immigrant from Colombia being attacked by a bunch of young white women calling her a disgrace to womanhood. I got it all on tape. I put it on my show. I mean, it was no way a protest. Say hello to your dog. I just got one that says pretty awesome love that, maybe mine will bark, too. What you were witnessing there was not a protest. It was a bunch of raving lunatics. One more point, I want to make on this. Judge, you don't have to take my word for it that the left is planning chaos on Election Night. Please don't. I need everybody to go and look up the Transition Integrity Project. Okay. And look up, Defeat this Info. Those are two groups in a project the left is working. In those documents, these leftist groups are already stating, Judge, and I'm quoting them. These are not my words -- that they're preparing for a street fight after the election, not a legal one. Those are their words, not mine. They are who they say they are. PIRRO: Street fight? Dan, that's a street fight if the President wins. What about I Biden wins? Are they okay? Or are they going to -- BONGINO: Yes, correct. Yes, that's important. Yes, so sorry. That's important. If the President wins, yes. PIRRO: All right, then Leo, let's talk. Leo, what do you think about the Insurrection Act on Election Night if something terrible happens? LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY AND PODCAST HOST: Well, first of all, let me make sure I get straight up and get ready. Okay, now, let me give you the answer. Here's the answer, as a Civil Rights lawyer -- as a Civil Rights lawyer, the President has the right to protect voters rights. So when he talks about using Federal agents, he is perfectly within the rights of the Constitution to protect people's right to vote. If people are going to be intimidated from the voting pool -- booth -- the President can use Federal agents to protect their Civil Rights. Voting is a Civil Rights, so I think it's a no brainer. Those who are arguing that the President can't use Federal agents, they're wrong about the law. Period. He's within his rights to do so. PIRRO: Right, right. There's no question about it. But in fact, I remember last year on Election Night, actually it was the next morning, I remember how crazy it was in Manhattan and I remember the police kind of lined up shoulder to shoulder on certain streets. But let's talk a little bit more about the protesters and those people who were out there, and when I asked the President, I said, who are they? And he said, apparently -- he said well, they are people that we're looking at right now. He said, and you'll be finding out pretty soon who they are. What does that tell you, Dan? BONGINO: That they're organized. Listen, Judge, I still keep good sources in the law enforcement community I came from before I started doing news commentary. They're all telling me unequivocally -- by the way, these aren't partisan actors. I don't -- honestly, I don't even know their politics. I've never asked them, but they've all told me that this stuff has been organized and Judge, this goes back to those early attacks about what was it? Three or four months ago after the George Floyd incident at the White House that the people they saw showing up there had documented histories in the past of organizing these types of things. The left wants you to believe these are just random acts of rage because of some police brutality incident or the Floyd incident, but a lot of these riots that were happening at night, I'm not talking about the protests in the day that remained peaceful. The stuff that was happening at night, make absolutely no mistake, it was organized chaos. PIRRO: Yes, it is organized chaos and by the way, where do you find pallets of bricks in the middle of a pandemic? A COVID pandemic? And you know 20 police and Leo, I want to go to you with this, 20 Police Chiefs have resigned since then and three of them African-American. Carmen Best from Seattle, I think we have some shots of that and we have a full screen of that. Carmen Best from Seattle and La'ron Singletary of Rochester and Renee Hall from Dallas. I mean, you would think that African-American Police Chiefs would be something that people were interested in racial justice would be would be supportive of, but they're calling for their resignations as well through more liberal and more leftist mayors and commissioners. TERRELL: I'm so glad you asked me a question and they talk about systemic discrimination. They hate black Police Chiefs. The point is very simple. PIRRO: Right. TERRELL: You cannot please criminals. These guys are extremists. So all these Democrats yelling systemic discrimination in Chicago, Seattle, you've got black mayors, you've got a black Police Chief, you've got black police officers. Judge, this is not 1960. These guys you cannot please. They are criminals and Joe Biden has made a deal with the devil because he thinks they're going to vote for him. They don't care about Joe Biden. They just want chaos. That's all they want -- it is chaos. PIRRO: Well, he's got some surprise coming, but anyway, guys stay right there. Is the left playing politics with the coronavirus vaccine? We're going to debate that next with Dan and Leo in just a moment. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Gallup survey that they just did says that the acceptance of the vaccine is pretty much going along political lines. The Democrats don't want to accept it because they don't trust it, because it's coming out of your administration. TRUMP: They don't want it because they think it's going to make me look good and it wins the election for me. But we're very close to a vaccine. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: The left continues to play ridiculous political games with COVID and now, with a potential vaccine, my panel is back to weigh in on some more of my sit down with President Trump. All right, guys, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are very much against the vaccine. They think it's all a lie as if the F.D.A. is going to approve a lie. The interesting thing is I just heard that Ivanka Trump indicated that she would go on \"The View\" and take the vaccine on \"The View\" which is quite interesting. But they are so -- they so hate Donald Trump that they don't want any kind of vaccine that would help them American people to be promoted because it might make him look good. What do you think of that, Dan? BONGINO: I mean, this isn't Saturday, Judge. I think on your show, I used to joke you know, if Donald Trump found a cure for cancer, you know, the left would come out and say, that's a horrible thing. He's taking the money from cancer researchers. We thought that was a stupid joke, but it's not even a joke anymore. So we have this deadly coronavirus, which has wiped out hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Donald Trump engages in this thing called -- marshals Operation Warp Speed in record time, we may -- may -- have a vaccine by the end of the year, and the left is pissed about it? What planet -- is this like? Remember the Superman comics? They had Bizarro Superman where everything was upside down and backwards. Even better, I would say, the \"Seinfeld\" episode where George does everything backwards. I mean, what planet are we living in? This is crazy time. PIRRO: All right, Leo, I mean, you've got to admit that it's absolutely bonkers. TERRELL: Oh, I'll tell you, Judge, Kamala Harris was on another cable network and she said, I don't know if I would take it. They don't want a vaccine because that's their bread and butter issue. They want this cut. They don't mind people being hurt, injured, and sick, just like the riots. They don't care. They think it's a winning formula. It's a loser. And regarding Ivanka going to \"The View,\" I want to go, too, because I've got some scores to settle with those leftists on that show. They're just outrageous, so, Ivanka, I'll go with you. I'll go with you to take the drug as well, the vaccine. They're crazy on \"The View.\" They are crazy. PIRRO: You know what's interesting is that, Joe Biden -- Joe Biden decides he is going to write an op-ed piece, \"My Plan to Safely Reopen America,\" right on April 12th. Everybody from \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" said this guy didn't say anything that the President hasn't already done. TERRELL: Yes, yes. PIRRO: It is just -- it's alarming that he's so not in tune with what's going on. But let's talk about the Nobel Peace Prize. Okay, the President since I interviewed him on Thursday, the President has been nominated by yet another country for the Nobel Peace Prize. So I mean, do you think -- what do you think the chances are of his getting it? TERRELL: Okay, I'm just -- go ahead, Dan, please. PIRRO: Go ahead, Leo. You want to say something. BONGINO: Sorry, Judge, not double down -- not to double down on this joke here, but this again, so Donald Trump marshals says peace deal that nobody said whatever happened, by the way, and now we have the left, what are we going to -- they're going to be signing up for the military to wanting to start lobbying? To start nuking countries randomly? I mean, again, this is the insanity of the times. The left who used to be the doves have now turned into the chicken hawks. They want to attack everybody all over the world now, and now they hate peace deals and vaccines. I mean, think of their campaign slogan, Biden-Harris 2020. No vaccines, wars everywhere. Vote for us, baby. We are for you. This is really serious crazy pills time. PIRRO: And not only that, war everywhere. Let's open the borders. Let's keep Americans in their bunkers and nobody get a gun. Go ahead, Leo. TERRELL: The bottom line is, get this, in the last three and a half years, no wars, American troops coming home, everybody, all these third world countries paying their fair share and they're upset. He is doing -- he is a better foreign policy President than he is domestic. He is the perfect man in the White House. He deserves four more years. PIRRO: Well, I mean, there's no question that what the President has done is he has required everybody else to pay their fair share. And you know, people are saying well, the other countries don't like us. Well, so what? At least they're paying their way this time. TERRELL: Yes. PIRRO: But you know, that the Nobel Peace Prize, I mean, you know, the idea of Israel, the UAE, now, Bahrain, as part of that peace deal. I mean, this is historic stuff and they laughed. They said, oh, Jared Kushner will ever be able to do it. Well, I guess he and his team and the President did it and it really is a sad, sad commentary. TERRELL: They're jealous. They are just jealous. PIRRO: Let me ask you a question. How do you think Joe Biden is preparing for the debate? Dan, you first. BONGINO: I don't know what he is doing to prepare for the debate candidly and I don't say this trying to be funny because I don't know what he'll remember from the preparation anyway. He is clearly -- there's something going on there, Judge. PIRRO: Well, he usually has the teleprompter. BONGINO: I don't think it's -- yes, I mean, I'm not trying to make light of the guy's cognitive decline. It's not funny. I mean, I had this in my family. But the man is running to be President of the United States as I've repeatedly said to you, is it not a fair question to be able to ask if he has the cognitive capability to do so? I don't think he does. Can I add one more thing though? You just brought up that fair share thing. That's hilarious because again, how crazy pills time -- the one thing that left is lobbying for is to overturn a tax cut for rich people, the salt exemption in California and New York. The rich want the wealthy to pay less taxes, I means the liberals. Right? This is -- that's actually happening right now. PIRRO: It's crazy. All right, I have 10 seconds. Leo, what do you think that Joe Biden is going to do to prepare for the debate? TERRELL: Well, I'll tell you right now, he is going to have to find someone like Trump to debate him and practice. Let me suggest Kamala Harris who destroyed you. That's who I suggest to you. Kamala Harris to go ahead and destroy him at the debate practice because he has no way of standing up to Donald Trump. Donald Trump is going to annihilate him at the debate. Period. BONGINO: That's pretty good. PIRRO: Well, all right. Dan Bongino and Leo Terrell, thanks so much for being with us. TERRELL: My pleasure. PIRRO: All right. And up next, remember Biden's big plan for a national mask mandate, he has quite a different view today. Charlie Kirk joins me next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I have a national mandate to wear masks. The constitutional issue where the Federal government could issue such a mandate, I don't think constitutionally they could, so I wouldn't issue a mandate. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: And that folks is the man who could be running the country if you don't vote on November 3rd. Here with reaction to that and much more, author of \"The MAGA Doctrine\" and Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk. All right Charlie, Joe Biden says he's going to mandate a national mask mandate and then he realizes that he doesn't have the power constitutionally to issue of Federal mandate like that. You think that guy is qualified to run for President -- to be President, but he is running. What do you think? CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: I mean, since when has the constitutionality of anything stop these people from issuing certain Executive Orders? That's number one. Number two, there's a broader theme here. Joe Biden's entire campaign is in retreat. For the last month, Joe Biden is now trying to backpedal, you could say it's backpedal Biden from positions he publicly declared and trying to clarify it. He's done this on fracking. He's done this on police, law and order, national mask mandates and now lockdowns and shutdowns. This is showing where President Trump is at its best. The President is playing offense. He is forcing Joe Biden now to re-clarify positions. Look, let's just call it what it is. Joe Biden was lying then or lying now when he says, well, I don't know if I would shut down the country together. He said it clearly in an interview that he would shut down the country again, and branding him as Lock Down Joe is a winning message for the President. When the President plays offense he wins. That's why the Biden campaign is in retreat. PIRRO: Well, you know, the interesting thing is that Biden, in spite of his op-ed that so many newspapers have said is redundant, that it makes no sense, and things that the President has already done. In an interview with Jake Tapper this week, Biden said that had the President acted one week earlier, there would be over 31,000 more people alive. Think about that. He didn't do it and it's almost criminal. This is same guy who said, you know, that he was xenophobic and it was hysteria and he couldn't recommend anything. And he was actually doing campaign rallies in March when the President stopped the flights coming in from China on January 31st. KIRK: Well, yes, in Joe Biden's defense, a campaign rally for him back then would still be considered socially distanced, and probably under C.D.C. guidelines of 10 people; however, you're right, Joe Biden was still doing campaign rallies back then. Joe Biden went after the heart of what President Trump did, which was the travel shut down early and decisive. It was a heroic action that saved hundreds of thousands of lives, not third, not just across America, but across the entire hemisphere and the President was ridiculed, he was called xenophobic. He was mocked on television, but that decision alone, even Dr. Fauci has said saved countless lives and gave America a head start. What was Nancy Pelosi doing during that time? She was marching in the streets in San Francisco. PIRRO: She was in Chinatown. KIRK: Yes, saying this is no big deal. We're not going to allow this sort of stereotyping to take heart of our country. So if there's someone who took it seriously, it was President Donald Trump. And by the way, it was Joe Biden and the Obama administration that left us depleted for personal protection equipment, it left us depleted for ventilators and made us completely unprepared for this issue. Here's the bottom line. President Trump has been cleaning up the mess of Joe Biden and his cronies the last three and a half years that Joe Biden took 40 years to make and Joe Biden acts as if he is some sort of an outsider. In reality, it is President Trump who is still the one that is disrupting the status quo. PIRRO: All right, quick question, quick question. The President has put out a list of those candidates from which he'll choose his next Supreme Court nominee. Joe Biden apparently is refusing to do so. Why do you think Joe Biden won't put out a list of nominees to the Supreme Court should he become President? KIRK: Well, because if he actually tells people who he is going to nominate to the Supreme Court, he'll either lose his progressive radical base or lose people in the middle. This is a winning message for the President. Why is Joe Biden sitting at home when the President does four rallies? Why is Joe Biden not releasing a list? The idea of transparency and accessibility are winning issues for the President while Joe Biden shelters in place, hopes he becomes President and can't articulate what it's going to do. PIRRO: Charlie Kirk, thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PIRRO: Finally, tonight, the wait is almost over. My new book, \"Don't Lie to Me\" is almost out. But don't worry, you can preorder right now on Amazon. You may need something stronger because it's all about the lies on the left. Anyway, thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way. JUSTICE has been served. And Greg Gutfeld should be coming up. I'll see you next Saturday night. Thanks so much.

A white California professor apologized and is under investigation for using the N-word in a lecture on\u00a0racism in America following George Floyd's death. University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) police science lecturer, Lt. Col. W. Ajax Peris, was being investigated by the school's Discrimination Prevention Office after a student posted a portion of his\u00a0lecture on social media. An undergraduate UCLA political science student in the class\u00a0told Fox News that Peris issued a \"trigger warning\" before reading the Rev. Martin Luther King\u00a0Jr.'s \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" and featuring clips from a documentary, that both included the N-word. SUSPENDED UCLA PROF SAYS SCHOOL USED HIM AS 'SACRIFICIAL LAMB' TO PLACATE 'THOSE WHO THREATEN TO RIOT' Peris,\u00a0an Air Force veteran,\u00a0issued an apology the day after the June 2 class for behaving in a way that was \"offensive and hurtful\" to the students. He\u00a0canceled the next class, and made the final exam optional as a\u00a0\"no-harm assignment, meaning ... it can only improve your grade.\" But UCLA political science department chairman, Michael Chwe, along with two other department heads, condemned Peris' written and video apology, writing: \"The lecturer\u2019s response to students\u2019 concerns escalated the situation rather than engaging in the thoughtful and open discourse that we expect from our faculty. IVANKA TRUMP RIPS \u2018CANCEL CULTURE\u2019 AFTER SHE\u2019S DROPPED AS COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER \"The lecturer also showed a portion of a documentary which included graphic images and descriptions of lynching, with a narrator who quoted the N-word in explaining the history of lynching. Many students expressed distress and anger regarding the lecture and the lecturer's response to their concerns during the lecture,\" the email read. \"We share students' concerns that the lecturer did not simply pause and reassess their teaching pedagogy to meet the students' needs.\" Neither UCLA nor Peris immediately responded to a request for comment. But the undergrad told Fox News that Peris\u00a0\"did nothing wrong.\" Although unable to attend a town hall Tuesday night about Peris, she called the students' actions \"bullying\" and the administration's response \"disturbing.\" \"This is a gross violation of academic freedom for Dr. Peris and his students,\" the undergrad wrote in a letter to the UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion on Wednesday.\u00a0\"Honest classroom discussions end where infringement on academic freedom begins.\" Peris is the second professor at the school to come under fire in recent days, alarming advocates for academic freedom like\u00a0the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). Katlyn Patton, FIRE spokeswoman, said it's Peris' First Amendment \"right to\u00a0decide whether and how to confront or discuss difficult or offensive material, including historical readings that document our nation's centuries-long history of racism.\" She added: \"Doing so does not amount to unlawful discrimination or harassment, and the law is abundantly clear that UCLA could not investigate or punish a professor for exercising his expressive or academic freedom.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP UCLA accounting professor Gordon Klein, who was suspended for not exempting black students from final exams in wake of Floyd's death, told \"The Ingraham Angle,\" he was the \"sacrificial lamb\" and said it's \"a sad day for free inquiry.\" After more than 20,000 signed a petition accusing Klein of a \"woefully racist response,\" the UCLA professor of 39 years has a police presence outside his house due to threats.",

            "article_content": "Kanye West weighs in on Planned Parenthood and how his mother refused to abort him as a baby at his first presidential rally in South Carolina. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York is removing the name of Margaret Sanger, the founder of the nation's largest abortion provider, from its New York City clinic due to her \"harmful connection to the eugenics movement,\" the group said Tuesday. The announcement comes after more than 350 current and former staffers\u00a0at the Manhattan clinic, as well as 800 donors, supporters\u00a0and volunteers, called Sanger \"a racist, white woman.\" An open letter on June 18 to Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, criticized the organization as \"steeped in white supremacy,\" the Washington Times reports. For decades, pro-life activists pointed\u00a0out Sanger's racism, but in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, Planned Parenthood said it is addressing the problem. KANYE WEST SAYS PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS CREATED BY 'WHITE SUPREMACISTS TO DO THE DEVIL\u2019S WORK'; ORG RESPONDS \u201cThe removal of Margaret Sanger\u2019s name from our building is both a necessary and overdue step to reckon with our legacy and acknowledge Planned Parenthood\u2019s contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color,\u201d Karen Seltzer, the chair of the New York affiliate\u2019s board, said in a statement. Margaret Sanger, shown in a 1959 photo, founder of the birth control movement in the United States, died in a nursing home Sept. 6, 1966, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced. She was 83 years old. The New York clinic is now asking city leaders to remove Sanger's name from local streets as well, the New York Times reports. It will now be called the\u00a0Manhattan Health Center. Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the national organization, said it supported the New York chapter's decision. BLACK WOMAN DUMPS PAINT ON MORE BLACK LIVES MATTER MURALS IN NYC: 'WE WANT OUR POLICE' \u201cPlanned Parenthood, like many other organizations that have existed for a century or more, is reckoning with our history, and working to address historical inequities to better serve patients and our mission,\u201d Melanie Roussell Newman, a spokeswoman for the group, said in the statement. The New York clinic's president and CEO, Laura McQuade stepped down\u00a0June 23 after the open letter accused her of abusive behavior and unfair treatment of Black staff members. The national organization has defended Sanger in the past, claiming she was well-intentioned in her outreach to Black communities. The Manhattan Planned Parenthood clinic changed its name and disavowed founder Margaret Sanger for her racist eugenics. (Google Maps) Sanger launched the Negro Project, in 1939, which was aimed at \"helping Negroes to control their birthrate,\" while advocating for a federal \"population bureau\" to police reproduction. She worked with Black leaders like W.E.B DuBois and Mary McLeod Bethune, but also addressed the women\u2019s auxiliary\u00a0of the Ku Klux Klan in 1926. Planned Parenthood stated it strongly disagrees with Sanger\u2019s decision to speak to an organization that spreads hatred. The national Planned Parenthood group also criticized\u00a0Sanger's support for policies to sterilize people with disabilities that could not be treated,\u00a0and for \u201cplacing so-called illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes\u00a0and dope fiends on farms and in open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct,\u201d the group said in a 2016 fact sheet. Rev. Dean Nelson, the executive director of Human Coalition Action and an African American minister, told Fox News in a statement that the decision is \u201clong overdue\u201d and said more action is needed. \u2018BABY LIVES MATTER\u2019 MURAL PAINTED IN FRONT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC \u201cYou cannot acknowledge the racist person and history without admitting to the racist vision that has resulted in nearly 80 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s surgical abortion facilities being located within walking distance of Black neighborhoods,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThis is the fulfillment of Margaret Sanger\u2019s vision. It is unconscionable that the taxes of Americans go to an organization with racist founding and mission. There\u2019s no redeeming Planned Parenthood\u2019s tainted origins and current-day racist practices, and I call on Congress to follow Planned Parenthood of Greater New York\u2019s lead and fully defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d The decision also comes as the anti-abortion Students for Life of America organization is launching an \"S.O.S. Strike Out Sanger\" campaign Tuesday calling for the removal of Sanger's statues and symbols wherever they are. \u201cMargaret Sanger\u2019s racist legacy continues to be at work in America, as seen in Planned Parenthood\u2019s business model,\u201d Students for Life of America\u2019s President Kristan Hawkins said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cBut whether in the Smithsonian, Manhattan,\u00a0or the Old South Meeting House on the Freedom Trail, Margaret Sanger\u2019s tributes need to be taken down and stored away because her desire to ensure that black babies would not be born doesn\u2019t deserve honor.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser took it a step further, calling on Planned Parenthood to \"immediately publish its historical abortion data by race given indications they have skewed the placement of abortion facilities and actively target minority communities,\" and \"drop its fierce opposition to anti-discrimination laws that protect unborn children from being selected for abortion due to their race, sex, or disability.\" Dannenfelser added, \"We further call on Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton to disavow and return their Planned Parenthood Margaret Sanger awards immediately.\"",

It\u2019s done.\u00a0Judge Amy Coney Barrett is now a sitting Supreme Court justice.\u00a0 She is the third Supreme Court justice appointed by President Donald J Trump. For some, her presence on the court is welcome; for others, it\u2019s a nightmare. Conservatives now have a 6-3 bulletproof majority on the Supreme Court. For those of us on the left, Barrett represents years and years of conservatives trying to control the highest court in the land. And now that she\u2019s been confirmed, she could truly affect millions of Americans in nearly every corner of their lives. With a new conservative court in place, it\u2019s possible we could see rights weakened or pushed back to decades in our past. Whether it be women\u2019s reproductive rights, climate change, same-sex marriage, voting rights, immigration, health care or issues surrounding discrimination, the future could make life nearly unbearable for millions of Americans. JESSICA TARLOV: SUPREME COURT, RUTH BADER GINSBURG AND THE FUTURE -- MAY HER MEMORY BE A REVOLUTION Take health care, for example. There is a new challenge to ObamaCare that the high court will soon hear. In the past, Barrett found fault with court decisions that actually upheld the Affordable Care Act. If Barrett votes in the future in a way that reflects her past criticisms of previous decisions, over 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance and millions with preexisting conditions would have nowhere to go to be insured. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away last month, creating a vacancy on the court, Trump and his Republican posse rushed to fill this seat; doing a 180 from their original stance in 2016 when they drove home the point that the American people should decide who should get to appoint the next justice when a vacancy occurs during a presidential election year. This is why we need Joe Biden and a Democratic majority in both the House and the Senate more than ever. It is hypocrisy at its finest. They would not consider then-President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, but now shove Barrett down the throats of both Democrats in the Senate and the American people. This is why we need Joe Biden and a Democratic majority in both the House and the Senate more than ever. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Republicans were wrong in 2016 not to seat Garland and they\u2019re wrong now in seating Barrett. If the American people should truly decide, they need to make their decision known (and loudly) at the ballot box on Nov. 3. Electing Biden would make Trump a one-term president and hopefully prevent any further travesties, as I see this appointment to be, on the Supreme Court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Over the next four years there could be more Supreme Court justices retiring. Justice Stephen Breyer is 82 and there are two other justices on the right-leaning court in their 70s.\u00a0 The next president might have the opportunity to fill one, two or even three Supreme Court seats. In this election, it\u2019s not just essential that the American people vote because the future of Donald Trump is on the ballot, but also because the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance and with it, the future of our nation and all Americans\u2019 rights as well.

President Trump\u00a0told suburban voters in a tweet on Wednesday they will \u201cno longer be bothered or financially hurt\u201d by having low-income housing in their neighborhood after his administration revoked an Obama-era housing rule. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, or the AFFH rule, was designed to eliminate racial disparities in housing by telling jurisdictions that receive housing funds they must assess patterns of housing discrimination and come up with a plan to diminish them. \u201cI am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood,\"\u00a0Trump tweeted Wednesday. \u201cYour housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!\u201d HUD REVOKES OBAMA-ERA RULE DESIGNED TO DIVERSIFY THE SUBURBS The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rescinded the 2015 rule last week as Secretary Ben Carson said the rule was \u201cunworkable and ultimately a waste of time for localities to comply with.\u201d It will be replaced by a new rule that reduces the burden of local jurisdictions to prove that they are actively taking steps to address historical patterns of racial segregation in order to qualify for HUD financing. \"Washington has no business dictating what is best to meet your local community\u2019s unique needs,\u201d Carson said. WHAT'S THE BIDEN PLAN TRUMP CLAIMS WOULD 'DESTROY' THE SUBURBS? Housing advocates have dinged Trump\u2019s opposition to the rule as a racially charged appeal to white voters in the midst of an election year, as Trump has repeatedly said the rule forces the construction of low-income housing in suburbs. \u201cYour home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cPeople have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they\u2019re going to watch it go to hell. Not going to happen, not while I\u2019m here.\u201d Trump has sought to pit presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden against suburban voters, last month saying Biden wants to make suburbs \u201cmuch worse.\u201d \u201cAt the request of many great Americans who live in the Suburbs, and others, I am studying the AFFH housing regulation that is having a devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas,\u201d the president tweeted.\u00a0\u201cCorrupt Joe Biden wants to make them MUCH WORSE. Not fair to homeowners, I may END! \u201cBiden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream,\u201d Trump tweeted last week, along with a New York Post column entitled \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s Disastrous Plans for the Suburbs.\u201d \u201cI will preserve it, and make it even better!\u201d Trump added. The New York Post column claims that under the AFFH rule, \u201ctowns everywhere would have had to scrap zoning, build bigger water and sewer lines to support high-density living, expand schools and social services and add mass transit. All pushing up local taxes. Towns that refused would lose their federal aid.\u201d Carson has said jurisdictions were \u201cforced to comply with complicated regulations that require hundreds of pages of reporting\u201d under the Obama-era rule. The issue has been a long-standing issue for Carson, and fair housing advocates say the program never truly got off the ground because Carson suspended its implementation shortly after taking office. Biden has said he would implement the rule. Biden's housing plan would get rid of zoning regulations in suburbs that send prices skyrocketing. \u201cExclusionary zoning has for decades been strategically used to keep people of color and low-income families out of certain communities,\u201d Biden writes.

            "article_content": "Johnson says 40 million African Americans should each receive $350,000 to atone for slavery and to close the wealth gap with white Americans. The Big Idea\u00a0is a series that asks top lawmakers and figures to discuss their moonshot \u2014 what\u2019s the one proposal, if politics and polls and even price tag were not an issue, they\u2019d implement to change the country for the better? Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, says it's\u00a0time America atones for slavery and systemic racism by paying African-Americans reparations to make them economically equal to white Americans. Johnson, the first black billionaire in the United States, has put a price tag on the debt America owes to African-Americans\u00a0at $14 trillion. BET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON SAYS DEMS TAKING BLACK VOTERS 'FOR GRANTED,' CALLS FOR BLM TO FORM PARTY \"Nobody talks about cash, but black people understand cash,\" Johnson told Fox News. Under his proposal, an estimated 40 million African-Americans would get $350,000 in direct cash payments over 30 years (costing the average taxpayer roughly $2,900 a year, according to his office). The $350,000\u00a0would signify\u00a0the wealth disparity between African-Americans and white Americans. To say this is controversial is an understatement. Some Democratic lawmakers have warmed to the discussion, but often in the form of commissions and other partial measures. A Fox News poll last year found most Americans are opposed to cash reparations. And with the government already spending trillions on coronavirus relief and the\u00a0national debt pushing past $26 trillion, concerns about the country's fiscal stability would pose an obvious hurdle. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last year of the idea:\u00a0\"I think we're always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that, and I don't think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it.\" Johnson contends white Americans built generations of wealth on the backs of slave labor, and black people\u00a0will never be able to catch up in wealth unless they are paid this\u00a0debt. \"You want a big idea:\u00a0white America, what would happen if you said, 'please forgive us and accept our apology. And by the way, we think we owe you what was taken from you for over 300 years of slavery, Jim Crow, segregation and denial of economic opportunity and rights,\" Johnson said. \"I think that would be a huge emotional assuaging of guilt.\" Johnson, the founder of RLJ Companies, discussed his\u00a0reparations proposal at length with Fox News this week.\u00a0This Q & A has been\u00a0edited for clarity and brevity: Black Entertainment Television (BET) founder Robert Johnson says American owes African Americans $14 trillion in reparations. (Photo by Ron Adar/Getty Images) Q: You\u2019ve put forth a reparations plan that calls for $14 trillion in direct cash payments to descendants from slavery. Why do you think it's important for today's Americans to atone for the sins\u00a0of the past? Johnson:\u00a0America from its inception has been plagued by the evils of slavery, so much so that this country fought a brutal civil war to try to settle the issue. Well, obviously, the issue was not settled after the Civil War. And this country has experienced\u00a0continual racial\u00a0violence, segregation and\u00a0discrimination since that time. And as a country that has espoused ideas about freedom, individual rights, equal treatment under the law, everything in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, and yet at the same time have this significant division between blacks and whites. Economically, socially, educationally -- all of these things are because America has never come to grips with its original sin of slavery, which has been responsible for most of the disharmony between blacks and whites in this country. And therefore, I'm proposing that if America\u00a0can atone for that in the form of cash payments to African-Americans to make them economically equal to white Americans, two things will happen. One, African-Americans will be, in effect, financially equal in a capitalist society and given the opportunity to grow wealth for themselves and their families. And two ...\u00a0unless you can atone, forgive and then repair in the form of the $14 trillion of cash, which the way I've developed it would make 40 million African-Americans equal in wealth to white Americans, we will live with this problem for generations to come. BET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON MOCKS CROWDS PULLING DOWN STATUES, CALLS THEM 'BORDERLINE ANARCHISTS' Q: Your plan calls for $14 trillion to be paid out to descendants of slavery over the course of 30 years. How do you get to that figure? Johnson: It's simple math. If you look at it this way, the median white American family has about $350,000 of personal net worth. African-Americans have about 10 times less than that. So about, let's say, $30,000 of personal net worth\u00a0of an African-American family. In\u00a0order to make everything equal. You have to bring African-Americans equal to white Americans. And the factors that we use to determine net worth are pretty simple. Your home is your most important asset for most middle-class people. African-Americans are way behind white Americans in homeownership. Income, i.e. salaries, are the next factor in wealth. African-Americans fall behind white Americans significantly in income, savings, investments in stocks and bonds, money to put your kids in school. When you take all these factors, you come up with the fact that the disparity of wealth is something that you need to close. So in order to close that -- to bring 40 million African-Americans, up to $350,000 of wealth. Well, you multiply that number -- $350,000 \u2013 times 40 million African-American descendants of slaves. You come out with $14 trillion. That money would be paid out over 30 years. Q: Would this be a special reparations new tax that would\u00a0fund this program? Johnson:\u00a0Ultimately, it's a debt owed by the taxpayers. And reparations is a debt owed by the nation as a whole because all of the wealth that was taken from slaves. Free labor is a transfer of wealth. That wealth of slavery found its way throughout the creation of wealth in the United States. I've often said that slaves may have died but the money that they created did not die. Money doesn't die. Money not only circulates; money multiplies. If you gave me a group of\u00a0the brightest forensic accountants, I would be willing to bet you that I could trace every dollar of wealth in the United States today back to slavery. REP. TIM RYAN'S BIG IDEA: GIVING AMERICANS A MENTAL TIMEOUT The $350,000 would be paid on average $10,000 to $11,000 per year for the next 30 years\u00a0to each\u00a0African-American descendant. Let's assume there are 170 million people who pay taxes in the U.S. If you break it down by days, it comes out to American taxpayers paying about $8 a day in reparations. Now, anticipating the question, what about poor whites who may not have that money to pay into the reparations program? Well, we could do it like we do other taxes. It could be a progressive tax. So those white Americans with more money would pay more, like the income tax. Those white Americans with less money would pay less. And by the way, African-Americans would also pay tax on this because it's a responsibility of the nation. And we're not exempting African-Americans from paying that tax, even though they are the recipients of the damages, just as if you were to get damages awarded by a court today. The court wouldn't say, well, you have damages coming, you\u00a0don't have to pay taxes. You have to pay taxes. Robert L. Johnson, BET Founder, at BET's 25th Anniversary. (File photo by L. Cohen/WireImage for BET Network) Q: And how do you envision these direct cash payments being distributed? And how would you determine who is eligible for the payments? Johnson: The eligibility is any African-American, black American, who is a direct descendant of slaves. So that's fairly simple. And the definition of who's black. We simply use the slave era definition of black. And back in slavery days\u00a0... if you had one drop of blood in you that was black you were determined to be black. You were treated as black. So we'll use that same model. The money would come out of the taxpayers\u2019 pockets. ...\u00a0\u00a0So that money would be transferred\u00a0in the form of a cash payment to every African-American. It's sort of like Social Security. They send you a check. Q:\u00a0There\u2019s been some reparations proposals in Washington. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has a bill that would establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African Americans and then make recommendations on reparation proposals. In the House, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas,\u00a0authored the companion legislation. Do you support these efforts? Have you talked to them about these plans? Johnson:\u00a0I know about them and I know Sheila Jackson Lee and I know Cory, but no, I have not talked about them. And fundamentally, the reason I haven't talked about them is because they are going nowhere. There is no need to study reparations or slavery. You can go to Google and you could have within an instant, hundreds of thousands of articles, literature, studies, on reparations and slavery. To me, this is rearranging the deck chairs on a racial titanic. It's not going any place. REP. RO KHANNA'S BIG IDEA: BRINGING SILICON VALLEY JOBS TO RURAL AMERICA The Democrats will never, ever vote for any reparations involving cash payments to descendants of slaves. They will never do it. And what they will do is what they have always done, which\u00a0is paternalistic programs managed by bureaucrats\u00a0to give support -- somewhat means-tested support -- in the black community. And call it a day. That's it. I guarantee you\u00a0that's what will happen with this study. Because that's what this government ... is comfortable with: giving money to hopefully well-meaning bureaucrats to supervise money going to help black people. If you're going to close the wealth gap, there are only two ways to do it. Either you've got to stop white people from getting wealthier, which you\u2019re not going to. Or you got to\u00a0make black people wealthier. The only way you are going to do it is if you give them cash. Programs don't do it. Q: \u00a0How would you know if this program has been successful? Would you gauge it from an economic standpoint where you see the wealth gap lessen or be closed? Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0You would obviously gauge it by closing the wealth gap. That's fairly simple because what happens when you have wealth, you do the things that white Americans have done from the time they first arrived here. They bought homes. They started businesses. They sent their kids off to college. They saved. They invested. And all of a sudden they accumulated wealth. African-Americans were denied that opportunity. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY\u2019S BIG IDEA: ALLOW AMERICANS TO SUE BIG TECH FOR SELECTIVE POLITICAL CENSORSHIP The second part is really up to white Americans. Will white Americans say to themselves, 'we have atoned for an original sin. And not only that, we have made 40 million African-Americans whole for what was done to them through no fault of their own.\u00a0They were dragged here on ships to be slaves. Not even people.\u00a0Property. And we took advantage of the labor that they created and used it to build our wealth.\u00a0Now we're saying we want to atone.' If white people see this as a way of saying in a huge way, I apologize. I'm sorry. I can assure you there are no more forgiving people on the face of the Earth than African-American people.",

            "article_content": "Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'Fox News @ Night' with insight. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, on Friday night called Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a \u201cfierce champion for equality\u201d after the news broke of Ginsburg\u2019s death from pancreatic cancer. But Collins, who faces the fiercest reelection battle of her Senate career, was silent on whether she would support or oppose\u00a0a vote on Ginsburg\u2019s successor\u00a0before the presidential election -- or the inauguration in January if Democrat Joe Biden were to win the presidency. \u201cJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a trailblazer for women\u2019s rights, a fierce champion for equality, and an extremely accomplished American who broke countless barriers in the field of law,\u201d Collins said in a statement. \u201cThroughout her life, Justice Ginsburg surmounted discrimination and sexism through her brilliance, tenacity, and wit, becoming one of the most prominent legal luminaries of our time.\u201d Collins\u00a0added that she \"had the great honor of getting to know Justice Ginsburg personally when the women Senators twice had dinner with her and former Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. She has been a role model to generations of women, and her legacy will live on in the countless people she inspired.\u201d SUSAN COLLINS ENDORSED BY BLUE-STATE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS IN MAJOR MAINE SENATE RACE Collins, 67, who has served in the Senate since\u00a01997, is among a handful of Republican senators occasionally willing to break rank with her party. So her vote on a Trump nominee to succeed Ginsburg prior to\u00a0the presidential election could loom large. Her crucial vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018 angered many progressive women across the country\u00a0(who opposed his nomination because of sexual assault allegations) -- as well as many Mainers who are determined to unseat her. Recent polls show Collins running around 5 points behind her Democratic challenger Sara Gideon, speaker of Maine's House of Representatives. It's unclear if voting for a Trump Supreme Court nominee so close to the election would help or hurt Collins' own reelection chances. MURKOWSKI, PRIOR\u00a0TO GINSBURG\u00a0PASSING, SAID SHE WOULD NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM A NOMINEE TO SUPREME COURT BEFORE ELECTION Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Friday that a Trump nominee would get a vote in the Senate -- in stark contrast to his previous stance that the next president should appoint Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s successor after Scalia died in early 2016. The Senate refused a hearing on former President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, and Trump's nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, was confirmed by the Senate shortly after Trump took office in 2017. Fellow Senate Republican nonconformist Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, prior to hearing about Ginsburg\u2019s death Friday, said she \"would not vote\"\u00a0for a new Supreme Court justice before the election. \u201cWe are 50 some days away from an election,\u201d Murkowski said in an interview, according to Alaska Public Media. A representative for Collins, however, declined twice to give an answer on whether Collins would vote for a Trump nominee, according to the Portland Press Herald in Maine.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\" August 14, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Joe Biden has not waded too deeply into questions of public policy recently. In case you haven't noticed. Whatever else Biden may be doing, looking at funny cat videos on the internet, shuffling to his mailbox every afternoon, it's fair to say that he is not running a campaign about ideas. But Biden has made at least one campaign promise so far, he has pledged that if elected, he will force you to wear a mask when you go outside. Now, Biden didn't specify which epidemiological studies would justify a law like that, that's probably because there aren't any. Not a single one -- but whatever. Biden has never been much of a science guy, he is a lifelong politician. His specialty is not public health, his specialty is power and coercion, so he does what he knows. Instead of explaining how wearing a mask when you ride your bike alone could possibly save anyone's life, Biden instead demands that you forget about your so-called rights as an American and obey his orders, no questions allowed -- otherwise you're unpatriotic. If it sounds familiar, that's because we have seen a lot of this lately. Democrats have decided to use our public health emergency as a political weapon to win the election. It turns out that is easier than trying to fix the country. Terrified, unhappy populations want change and that's welcome news to the party trying to take power, that's why they are doing it. But what's the cost to the rest of us? To America? It's profound. Thanks to restrictions that are rooted in politics rather than science, children cannot go to school or play with their friends. Parents can't go to work. People can't get married or attend funerals. Human contact has been drastically curtailed. These are not small things. They are essential human needs. Without them, we can't live. In May, we talked to a father whose teenage son killed himself, he believes because of isolation caused by the coronavirus lockdowns. It was a crushing segment and hard to watch, but it's worth watching. Here's part of the conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRAD HUNSTABLE, FATHER OF 12-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE: My young 12-year-old boy, three days before his 13th birthday took his life. Hayden was a normal kid. He wasn't depressed. He died of the COVID virus. He didn't die of the coronavirus, but he died certainly because of the COVID virus. Isolation has created what I believe and what I worry and I'm warning every parent in America tonight, an emotional tsunami that is sweeping this nation and I'm very concerned about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: He had reason to be very concerned about it, that was nearly three months ago, the country has become sadder and more isolated since. In fact, the lockdowns had driven Americans to the edge and that's not speculation. According to new data from the C.D.C., fully a quarter of all young people in this country between 18 and 24 recently have considered suicide, seriously thought about killing themselves. That is a massive and a terrifying increase over previous surveys. It's a tragedy. Anxiety and depression are at record highs. Many Americans have fallen into a spiral from which they will not escape. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): Because of coronavirus, many people are now unemployed or isolated at home, and as a result, the drug epidemic has intensified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You shoot up. You smoke. You do whatever it is you do, pop a pill, and the world goes away for a while. (END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over); Joe Cordovano runs Fresh Start Ministries in Orlando and says they are seeing more relapses and more stories of drug abuse as a result. Nationwide, it's the same story. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that since the outbreak, overdoses are up between 30 and 40 percent. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: People are depressed, you see it all around you. They are depressed because they are cut off from one another, they are depressed because their lives are moving backwards. According to data collected last month, 12 percent of American households in the richest country in the world are now routinely short on food. More than 20 percent of all renters in America are behind on payments. Keep in mind, these data were collected before Federal unemployment benefits expired. People are abandoning their pets. Prescriptions are going unfilled. We could go on. Big parts of this country are becoming poor, but you don't hear about it much because to the media and our leaders in Washington, it's not a very big deal. They can't imagine worrying about money. In Washington, they live in a city with guaranteed full employment, always and forever, thanks to the Federal government and it affects their attitudes. Here is Tony Fauci, the most political man in the most political city in America telling you that going broke isn't really a big deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I know it's difficult, we are having a lot of suffering, a lot of death. This is inconvenient from an economic and a personal standpoint, but we just have to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: It's inconvenient, says Dr. Fauci? Remember when you respected that guy? Remember when he seemed like a legitimate public health expert? We do. He was on this show. We treated him like a physician. Now it is clear, Fauci is just another oily politician on an ego trip, just like the rest of them. In case you haven't been to a supermarket recently, Fauci is featured on the cover of \"In Style\" magazine photographed by the pool, a man of science. What a buffoon. But Fauci isn't suffering during the lockdowns, he is loving it. Tony Fauci is enjoying the hell out of himself. So is CNN. Jeff Zucker understands that the lockdowns are the only way his personal friend, Kamala Harris is ever to going to run the country, so his anchors dutifully berate the public for not obeying even as they ignore the rules they demand that you follow. Watch the body builder's 'roid rants on the subject. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: All right, so while most Americans are staying inside or should be, right, if they are not out protesting like fools -- they are not happy about being told to stay home. Staying home saves lives. And the rest of us should be staying at home for our mothers and the people that we love and to keep us farther apart will ultimately bring us closer together in this cause. Our collective conscientious actions -- staying home. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Stay home. That's the order, except of course, when you are pledging allegiance to the Democratic Party, then in that case, feel free to fill up the streets. It's healthy. In New York City, for example, local politicians gathered in front of Trump Tower to paint Black Lives Matter on the street. Social distancing was not required. Even old Bill de Blasio showed up high as a kite as usual and did his best to make a straight line. Jeff Zucker didn't complain, of course, the media loved it. But keep in mind, not all public gatherings are equally safe. Some are incredibly dangerous. It's hard to know the difference unless you are politically attuned. In New York, the city just announced it will not commemorate 9/11 as it always does this year. The traditional twin beams of light over Manhattan will be dark next month. Why? Because officials say they can't risk the safety of the crews they would need to set up the Memorial. Turning on two lights is just too dangerous right now. There's a pandemic out there. Do you take them at their word? Do you think that's a real problem? Come on. You know what's going on. Anything that brings people together, that unites us as a nation, that gives people pride in their country must be stopped. Anything that causes division, fear, panic, anxiety, and hatred must be amplified, no matter how many kids kill themselves as a result. There's an election coming up. Here's Dr. Biden explaining the rules. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If I were President today, I would roll back re-openings in a number of places. And everyone wherever there is a significant percentage of people with COVID should be required to keep social distancing and masks. Bars should not be open. There should not be congregations of more than 10 people. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Oh, so after consulting with his advisers -- all of them political advisors -- Biden has located the core of the problem. It turns out America isn't shut down enough. People might be tempted to go to church or have dinner with their friends or work for a living. Kids could wind up in school and learn things that haven't been prescreened by Google. Somewhere, a young couple might decide to take a walk through the woods without masks to enjoy nature and fresh air and if things like that continue, happiness might return to America. We can't have that, not until people learn how to vote correctly. Ned Ryun is the founder and CEO of American Majority, and the author of the book, \"Restoring Our Republic.\" We are happy to have him on tonight. NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Good to be with you. CARLSON: So Ned, these numbers from the C.D.C., actual science, apparently, surveys of people's attitudes show that a quarter of young people have thought recently of killing themselves. You would think a number like that would cause the political leaders tamping down the country to maybe reassess, has it, do you think? RYUN: No, I mean, we were warned about this, Tucker, back to the end of June, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned us and said its relatively low risk for children with coronavirus, but what is a high risk which dwarfs the risk of coronavirus is the developmental damage, the psychological and physical damage that will result with kids not going back to school and it's fascinating now to see it play out in real time. And the people that have been fighting to keep the schools closed, who attacked Donald Trump for trying to reopen the schools, they are the real science deniers. I should point it out, they have denied real science. But now, you are seeing some of them realize perhaps, just maybe like Chuck Schumer, we should pivot on this because they realize their response to the virus is causing such damage to families, to children, to our society as a whole that perhaps their response is doing more damage than the virus ever will. And I would remind the American people, we are less than 12 weeks away from an election and it's time to stop and think, to ask yourselves, what do you truly believe? What do you believe about yourself as the American people? What do you believe about God-given rights? What do you believe about the role of government in your lives? And quite frankly, who is actually in charge? And who do you want in power? Do you want the Democrats and their propagandas, to force you to be inferior, to cower in your basements as our society, as our economy goes to hell in a hand bask basket, or you want responsible leadership? Or are we going to actually going to approach this in a responsible and thoughtful way? Actually trust the real science and realize we are not going to have a utopia with this virus just magically ceases to exist, we will protect the most vulnerable, but we are going to go back to our regular lives. That in many ways, among other things is what is at stake in November. CARLSON: What is so striking is the total unwillingness of anyone on the left with some noble exceptions, Matt Taibbi, I would say would be one, Glenn Greenwald. There are some -- RYUN: Exactly. CARLSON: But in general, they will not criticize their own team. Period. If some Republican politician -- and Ned, you've gone after Republicans, I would say more harshly than anybody we've had on the show, if some Republican politician were doing this in order to win an election, would you stand by and let it happen? RYUN: No, absolutely not, and I think this is a thing that is horrifying to watch, the death of any real journalism. I think we can all at some level we can agree the death of real journalism has taken place. These people are propagandists. They are interested in pushing a narrative, and I will say this, the propagandists and the Democrats, they stopped caring because the American people a long time ago because it was inconvenient for their narrative. I mean, think about it, they are supporting Black Lives Matter who are looting in Chicago, stealing Gucci, saying, well, this is reparations as the middle class is literally dying. They are out of jobs. They are losing their businesses, but they were forgotten and abandoned by Democrats, and I would argue some of the ruling class Republican years ago. It's time for the American people to say enough of this madness. We are actually going to be manipulated anymore. We are actually going to take a stand and we are going to say, we are going to put an end to this in November. We are the ones in charge. I would remind the American people in a Constitutional Republic, all power flows from the people, start acting like it. CARLSON: That's exactly right. When they start telling you, you can't commemorate 9/11 with lights, but you can loot the Gucci store, this is not -- you know, we shouldn't put up with this. Ned Ryun, as always, great to see you. RYUN: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: There is suddenly indiscriminate violence throughout the country, it's on the rise. Our leaders have decided to accept it. But maybe this crime will get the entire country to pause and ask where are we going? It was the execution-style murder of a five-year-old boy last week in North Carolina. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Five-year-old Cannon Hinnant was riding his bike outside of his Wilson, North Carolina home over the weekend when police say a neighbor, 25-year-old, Darius Sessoms came out and shot him in the head. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cannon was the kind of kid that was always polite. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You just could not help to be changed when you met Cannon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really, everybody just wants answers, you know, for why this was done. (END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Cannon's father is confused by his son's murder saying there is no explanation for why Sessoms would target his son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AUSTIN HINNANT, CANNON HINNANT'S FATHER: There was never anything between me and him, any bad blood whatsoever. (END VIDEOTAPE) CARLSON: It's just -- it's really beyond. The suspect has been charged with first-degree murder. The question is, why haven't the media covered this story? What about it don't they like? Nancy Grace is the host on Fox Nation. She joins us tonight. Nancy, thanks so much for coming on. Make sense of this, if you would for us. NANCY GRACE, FOX NATION HOST: Thank you for inviting me. Well, you know what, when you put the picture up just then of Cannon Hinnant, just five-year-old. By the way, he was set to start kindergarten this week. And I think back on my children, as you know them, John, David and Lucy, when they went to kindergarten and what a big day it was and now, he is gone forever. And you're right, this case has not been covered and I wonder why, too. This is what I know. I know that the families were friends. There had never been any bad blood between them at all. Now, according to family members, the motive was that this little boy, it's a Sunday afternoon, 5:30 broad daylight. They had gone to church. They had gone to lunch. They were out in the yard playing. The little boy rode his bike into the neighbor's yard and the defendant according to eyewitnesses -- multiple eyewitnesses -- 25-year-old, Darius Sessoms comes out, holds a gun up and shoots the child point blank in the head. I predict this will be a death penalty case. CARLSON: Look, I've said many times and I mean it that I don't think you should draw broad societal conclusions from a single horrific crime. The media specializes obviously in that and some of those conclusions are misleading, if not lies. But to ignore something completely, and they ignore murders, by the way, every day on the Southside of Chicago as well, you really get the feeling that news coverage has guided purely by political imperatives, purely. GRACE: Well, it seems to me that right now, with the concern over COVID and not going to back to school and the issues surrounding that and the protests all around the country, even attacking a Ronald McDonald house while sick children were inside cowering, that's all the headlines. What about this boy? What about justice in this case? What about my children and your children? They deserve to get just as much attention as all of the other headlines. CARLSON: Yes, they are liars. Nancy Grace, one of the most direct people on television. Always a pleasure to have you. Thank you for doing this. GRACE: Likewise. Thank you. CARLSON: So, at the core of the Russia scandal was a couple of deeply corrupt American Federal agencies, not Russian -- American, and today, we got a glimpse of that corruption. An F.B.I. lawyer expected to plead guilty for corruption, maybe the sign of more prosecutions to come, we'll have the very latest on that. But first, one of the most beautiful places in the country is in danger, we don't do a lot of environmental stories, but this one is worth doing. Johnny Morris who is the founder of Bass Pro Shops is here to talk about it. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: If you hunt or fish or spend time outdoors regularly, you've probably heard of something called the Pebble Mine. It's been talked about for many years. It's an enormous mine, just proposed at this point, not in operation, a gold and copper mine that will be built on Southwest Alaska's Bristol Bay and the concern is, it could be devastating to the fisheries there and to the wildlife, many of the world's salmon spawn there. And so conservation groups have been fighting this proposed mine for quite some time. Now, it could potentially become a reality. Permitting is before the administration right now and will be decided soon. Interestingly, in most environmental controversies, there is a clean partisan split. Republicans are on one side, Democrats on the other. But this is not so clear, suddenly you are seeing a number of Republicans including some prominent ones, including some very conservative Republicans saying, \"hold on a moment,\" may be Pebble Mine is not a good idea, maybe you should do whatever you can not to despoil nature and maybe not all environmentalism is about climate. A lot of interesting questions. We are honored to have Johnny Morris, he is the founder of Bass Pro Shops, probably the greatest outdoor retailer in the history of the world, some of us think so, and we are happy to have him. Mr. Morris, thanks much for coming on. JOHNNY MORRIS, FOUNDER, BASS PRO SHOPS: Thank you, Tucker. Thank you for your enthusiasm for Bass Pro Shops. I am coming to you hear from our headquarters, Granddaddy Store. We started here about 50 years ago and I feel so blessed in my life to be introduced to the sport of fishing along with my sisters by my mom and dad, and I just want to say to you, I hear you like to fish and I just want to say as a fellow angler, thank you from all fellow anglers and everyone that loves the outdoors and nature and for future generations for spotlighting this issue that you are raising tonight, because it's extremely important. It's such an amazing, fragile, special resource, not just for here in America, but for the world. It's amazing. CARLSON: Well, I think that's right and the reason I'm so eager to talk to you is that I don't think of you as a political figure, I've never seen you weigh in one way or the other on a political issue. I don't think it is a political issue. Explain for us, to our viewers who aren't familiar with this. As crisply as you can, why are you concerned about the construction of a massive mine in Alaska? Why is this Pebble Mine a problem, do you think? MORRIS: You're right. Conservation should be a uniter of people, right? CARLSON: That's right. MORRIS: Of everybody. So, this mine is proposed really in the heart of the largest spawning grounds in the world, one of the most pristine areas, watersheds really in the world. Over 50 million salmon have already spawned there this year. Approximately half of all the wild salmon that's harvested for the world comes from this region. A lot of jobs. I hear this proposed mine maybe 2,000 jobs. There are 14,000 plus jobs currently serving recreational fishing, commercial fishing, ecotourism, so there's a lot of economics with this. But beyond that, you know, I was hearing you speak earlier, Tucker, about, you know, just we hear the news and not all that's happening. There's a lot of issues that are bad in the world and for people to have a pristine place to go and this is sought after by people really all over the world to come here. And so to me, it's worth fighting for, standing up to say this, this mine has some value. If I have a minute, I would like to share with you a quote that's very profound from President Roosevelt who is really the Father of Conservation. CARLSON: Amen. MORRIS: \"There can be no greater issue than that of conservation in this country. We must conserve the soil so that our children shall have land that is more and not less fertile than our fathers dwelt in. We must conserve the forests not by disuse, but by use, making them even more valuable at the same time that we use them.\" \"We must conserve the mines. Moreover, we must ensure so far as possible the use of certain types of great natural resources for the benefit of the people as a whole.\" And I do applaud our President, because I think he's helped us regain our energy independence and you know, the impact on our economy and also our safety and security, to be independent from some of our foreign enemies. It's very important. And I think these things can go together hand-in-hand. We can harvest in a healthy, responsible way and still have, you know, like Roosevelt said, enhance our resources. CARLSON: Anybody who doesn't spend a good part of his life outdoors is not a credible voice on conservation or the environment and you are the opposite. You spend an awful lot of your life outdoors. Johnny Morris, it's an honor to have you on the show tonight and I should say that Trout Unlimited and a lot of conservation groups with actual sportsmen in them, people who hunt and fish, and use the outdoors have the same position that you do and God bless them for that. Thanks a lot. MORRIS: One closing thing. CARLSON: Of course. MORRIS: My son and I. How do you put a price on that grin? It's not just me and my boy, but it's fathers, sons, daughters, grandparents. Go fishing, it's a happy thing. We appreciate you, Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Well, you've heard a lot recently about institutional racism. It is the cause of every one of America's problems -- that's not true. But it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It does exist. The Department of Justice just found a clear-cut case of institutional racism at an Ivy League University. But for some reason, the left isn't interested in hearing about it. We've got details just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are hardly deep thinkers, that's the whole point. It's the water bug campaign on the surface. But if you ask them, rouse them from a dead sleep, what is an existential threat that America faces? Russia? Iran? But number one on the list would be institutional racism. That's the biggest threat we face. Neither one of them can define that term, obviously. Joe Biden gave a speech about it this summer. He didn't even try to define it, he just declared that institutional racism is everywhere. And apparently it is, and they are telling institutional racism cost Kamala Harris to drop out of the presidential primary, just as she was about to lose her home state. It's what made that Minneapolis cop murder a man. When the crops failed in Ancient Rome, the authorities blamed the gods, but when Democrats don't like something, they blame institutional racism. You've seen a lot of this. But that does not mean that institutional racism doesn't exist. The Justice Department just made a pretty strong case that it does exist. The D.O.J. has concluded that Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut systematically discriminates against Asian and white applicants. There's not really any question about the evidence. It's overwhelming. The D.O.J. looked at Yale's admission practices over an 18-year period. What did they find? Quote: \"Asian-American and white applicants have only one- tenth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as African-American applicants with comparable academic credentials.\" They caught Yale cold. Yale hasn't even denied it, really. It's true. And by the way, everybody knows it's true. Ask any Chinese or Korean American parent you know. They are highly aware of hits. Their kid could have straight A's and an amazing SAT score, but he's not going to Princeton. He will be lucky to get into Boston College because he is the wrong color. Is there a single American who doesn't know this? Everybody knows it. Are we okay with that? Shut up, say Democrats. Stop talking about it. Is not a real problem. As one \"New York Times\" writer put it, quote: \"Justice Department working overtime for those marginalized, depressed upper-class white students able to go to Yale, looking after Main Street,\" as if that's what it's about. What would be funny would be to see what would happen if Ivy League schools stopped admitting these low IQ children of famous liberals. What will they think of that? Peoples like CNN's Chris Cuomo who went to Yale because his dad was the Governor of New York. Would \"The New York Times\" support that? Shutting down the pipeline for the kids of Democratic politicians to Brown, Yale, Princeton, Harvard? Oh no. That would hit them where they live. But discriminating against some Korean kids so we can feel virtuous, oh yes, we are for that. Another \"New York Times\" writer put it this way, quote: \"It is not discrimination to take into account systemic inequality.\" Right. So in other words, it's not discrimination to discriminate as long as I'm the beneficiary of the discrimination. Okay, so that's how it works, but isn't that how the Jim Crow South worked? Yes. But, the left doesn't care about details. According to \"The New York Times,\" if you're an African American student who got a Mercedes from your parents for your 18th birthday, you are the victim of systemic inequality. You need a 200-point bonus on the SAT. But if you're a kid from Appalachia who grew up in a trailer park without parents, had to work your way through high school at Crystal Burger, you are the beneficiary of systemic racism. Not one person believes that. It is absolutely ridiculous. It makes no sense. It's insulting to all of us. It's degrading to all of us -- because it's too unfair. But they don't care. The goal isn't to convince you, the goal is to make you as cynical as they are. They think they can accomplish that and maybe they can by rubbing their total lack of moral standards into your face. Just weeks ago, the media that doesn't care about Yale's overt discrimination against Asians was horrified about the term Wuhan coronavirus because it could hurt Chinese Americans, they said. They never explained how, but they said it. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The President referred to the coronavirus as a quote, \"foreign virus.\" And I think it's going to smack -- it is going to come across to a lot of Americans as a smacking of xenophobia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Xenophobic wartime Trump where he thinks the only path now is to basically declare the virus public enemy number one, painted in somewhat racist terms. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__MOVEON.ORG&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=J5180z5W1i7j-4ZVvg79MvzPevrI8vx1sdGS71BVz0M&s=ZG-Jgu7IVRBDyOUzTTPCHT6TAEZhiDZWIbjSCEMnTn4&e= CHIEF PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER: The xenophobia and racism in an outbreak is such a common thing and it is incredibly dangerous. It is problematic and it is scary, and I just really want to call that out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? Why do you keep using this? A lot of people say it is racist. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is not racist at all, no. Not at all. It comes from China. That's why. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: It is quote, \"problematic and scary\" to criticize the Chinese government but not to openly discriminate against Chinese American children. But you cannot criticize the government of China, anyone who does must be silenced. White House adviser, Peter Navarro was actually thrown off the air for the crime of telling CNN's viewers where the coronavirus came from. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: And I will say that this virus that is affecting the United States right now is -- PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: The China virus. The CCP virus BERMAN: You know what, we let you say that once, Peter, please don't say it again on this show. I know what you're saying it. NAVARRO: The China virus. BERMAN: All right, Peter Navarro, we appreciate you being with us, I know what you're trying to do there. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: \"I know why you're saying it,\" the anchor scolds. Right. You're not allowed to say certain things on the air on CNN or MSNBC or else you might start thinking for yourself. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Wuhan coronavirus has now surpassed the 2003 SARS outbreak. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: The first U.S. case of Chinese coronavirus was confirmed at one of her hospitals. KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Inside that building is the world's first lab grown copy of the Wuhan coronavirus outside Mainland China. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Chinese coronavirus death toll has jumped to at least 26 million people. ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: The death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus spiked today. FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: The Chinese virus, the coronavirus that is worrying the whole world. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: This comes as the Chinese coronavirus death toll has jumped to at least 26 people and sickened at least 835 people. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Oh, so it was okay to call it the Wuhan coronavirus, because it is from Wuhan, probably from a Chinese lab, actually, the evidence shows. But once that became a public relations problem for the Chinese government, you are racist for saying it. So what can we conclude? Actual racism means nothing to these people. What matters is whether they can use racial division to advance a partisan political agenda. Where is the ACLU in all of this? The ACLU spent, I don't know, about a hundred years worrying about racial discrimination. They were always leftwing. They did some pretty virtuous things, but they announced on Thursday that they have no problem with systemic racial discrimination in college admissions, quote: \"Calling for an end to consideration of race in college admissions threatens the future of campus diversity.\" Oh, in other words, says the ACLU, we need racism because it brings us diversity. This, it goes without saying, is totally grotesque, that's why almost nobody says it out loud. They don't want you to talk about it because they can't defend it. And in fact, once the words hit the air and people look at them, they realize, wow, this is disgusting. And yet, Kamala Harris supports it. Along with the ACLU, she is pushing to eliminate the core anti-discrimination law in California. We can't say this enough. That's how shocking this is. In the 1990s, Californians passed by popular vote, Proposition 209. That recognized that giving racial preference is wrong, it is morally wrong. But Democrats have changed their view. Now, they understand that discrimination is key to their goals. A caste system, a system in which Americans are rewarded or punished based on how they were born allows them to take and maintain power. So in some ways, the man who started this debate, at least in the modern era is a man called Ward Connerly. He is the President of Californians for Equal Rights. He is the author of the original Californians Discrimination Law that Kamala Harris and others are now trying to overturn, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Connerly, thanks so much for coming on. WARD CONNERLY, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIANS FOR EQUAL RIGHTS: I'm delighted to be with you. Thanks for calling attention to this problem. CARLSON: It is a little bit stunning. I mean, I can't -- I've thought of you many times because I'm old enough to remember when you got this ballot initiative through in California. How do you feel seeing the leaders of the modern Democratic Party work to overturn it? CONNERLY: I am saddened, disappointed. I long for the days of John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey and all of those who were champions of Civil Rights. But this whole business of \"diversity\" in quotes has taken over the country and the name of affirmative action, we are doing discriminatory acts against people who are largely who are white and of Asian descent, primarily Americans who are Chinese in descent, but Americans. We are doing it and nobody seems to care, and the entire political structure which is a monopoly of Democrats in California believes that they are doing God's work by discriminating against people. It's wrong. It is morally wrong and in the fullness of time, we will find if we keep on this path that it is going to lead to the economic destruction of our state. One of the things that we are faced with in California is a ballot initiative, Proposition 16, which would repeal the initiative that 55 percent of the people in my great State of California approved. And that initiative, Proposition 209 reads, quote: \"The state (that's a small S) shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting.\" Tucker, 37 words, hidden words, no secret to it. It is simple and it is direct, but they want to repeal it, and the ballot label that will guide the voters says that this is an effort to allow diversity. It is corrupt. It is morally corrupt. It is a plague on our democracy to mischaracterize it and we are worried, because we don't have the dollars that they have. They've had two people contribute a million dollars apiece. The founder of Netflix and another billionaire, they've kicked in $2.5 million to do this and I'll bet you they can tell you what they were doing if their life depended upon it. But that's where we are. CARLSON: It's the saddest thing I've seen in a long time, and as I've said, I've thought of you a lot, Ward Connerly, and I'm grateful that you came on tonight and put that as clearly as you just did. Thank you. CONNERLY: Thank you. CARLSON: So the question before us now is, \"Can coronavirus survive in frozen foods?\" Is it in your popsicle this August? Dr. Siegel joins us to separate fact from fiction. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: The island nation of New Zealand went 102 days without a single local coronavirus transmission, but now, they are panicked because a small number of new cases they believe might have come in frozen food. Meanwhile, Chinese cities say they found small traces of coronavirus in chicken wings they got from Brazil. So should we ban frozen food and what is the future of popsicles? Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox News medical contributor, we are happy to have him on tonight. Doctor, what is the truth? DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, this is politics of fear, the international edition tonight, and let's start with China, exporters of the coronavirus. Now, they are claiming, whoa, we are importing frozen food, as you said, chicken wings from Brazil and also Ecuador shrimp that they found traces of coronavirus on. Wouldn't that be international justice by the way if the exporters of the virus suddenly were reimporting it? Well, that's too good to be true because the truth is that having traces of this coronavirus doesn't lead to infection. We found in Nebraska when we were out there, it was found in all the surfaces. It doesn't mean that you are going to get sick from it. The World Health Organization, by the way agrees with me. I wish I could add that to the list except we know from covering it on this show how often they have been wrong. So I won't count that as a reason. But nevertheless, it's not the case. Now, secondly, New Zealand. Well, New Zealand is panicking tonight, Tucker, because of 30 people got COVID-19. They are tracing it to a ship, a freight ship, but they are saying, how do we know it's not in the frozen food that the ship brought ashore? Well, I'm going to tell you something in New Zealand, it's in one of the workers, I'm sure that came ashore illegally. That's got to be what it is. They broke the quarantine and you know what you're doing, New Zealand? You're reacting -- overreacting for 30 people by shutting down the City of Auckland. Tucker, 1.7 million people have to stay at home now. So, here's my prescription for the weekend, Tucker. Take that popsicle out of the freezer. Do not boil it. You can eat it as it is and the chicken wings in your freezer, I want you to cook them, but not because of coronavirus, because of E. coli -- Tucker. CARLSON: A greater threat than coronavirus in this case. Dr. Marc Siegel, happy to have you tonight, thanks so much. SIEGEL: Happy weekend. CARLSON: You, too. Well, as promised, an F.B.I. lawyer expected to plead guilty to falsifying evidence that was used to spy on a Trump campaign aide. Are more criminal convictions on the way? That's all next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Sources have confirmed to Fox News that a former F.B.I. lawyer called Kevin Clinesmith plans to plead guilty to falsifying evidence -- evidence that the F.B.I. use to get a surveillance warrant on Carter Page. Page, of course, the former Trump aide whose life was overturned in the Russia nonsense. According to the Inspector General of the Justice Department, Clinesmith deliberately altered a C.I.A. e-mail to make it seem that Page was hiding his communications with Russia. In fact, the C.I.A. said, Page was disclosing those communications and was acting as an informant to the U.S. government. Clinesmith reportedly showed the full e-mail to others at the F.B.I. and D.O.J., so where are they? Are more prosecutions coming? Nobody knows more about this topic or can explain it more clearly than Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at \"The Federalist\" and a frequent guest on this show. We are happy to have her tonight. Mollie, I am just going to throw it to you. What have we learned from this? And what is coming? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR OVER AT \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, we already knew that Kevin Clinesmith had doctored evidence to in order to illegally spy on Carter Page. Today, we actually have the guilty plea or we believe that that's coming, the guilty plea showing that that happened. This is the beginning of the possibility that people will be held accountable for the conspiracy to target the Trump campaign through an illegal campaign to spy on the Trump campaign and the Trump administration, to criminally leak about them, to doctor evidence. There is a lot of wrongdoing. Unfortunately, a lot of the wrongdoing might not meet the criminal threshold, but when it does, Attorney General Barr has said that people will be held accountable and when it doesn't, he says, we are still going to find out what happened and how it was that so many people within the government, the Democratic Party, the never Trump movement and their co-conspirators in the media were able to perpetrate this scheme against the Trump administration. CARLSON: So we find, apparently find, we haven't seen the guilty plea, but it looks like an F.B.I. lawyer has admitted corruption. Corrupt F.B.I. lawyers are a danger to every American no matter who they voted for, so you'd think the left would be celebrating this cleaning up operation. Are they? HEMINGWAY: Tucker, it is so rare for anyone affiliated with the F.B.I. to actually be held accountable for something like this, so it really speaks to how serious of a problem it was and how much they had the goods on him. And you know, when every little thing was dripped out by the media for years claiming that there was collusion between the Trump administration and Russia, now that we actually have our first example here of criminal wrongdoing, the media are kind of downplaying it and acting like it's not a big deal. And that's understandable because they were implicated in this as well. In fact, they were some of the worst offenders in perpetrating this collusion hoax on the American people. The last thing that they want is for anyone to be held accountable and they are trying to make sure this story goes away as quickly as possible. CARLSON: You don't want a corrupt F.B.I. In just one sentence, when a Democrat finally does get to the White House, do you think they're going to clean up the F.B.I.? Do you think they are going to be afraid of the F.B.I.? Will everyone be afraid of the F.B.I. forever now? HEMINGWAY: This should never happen to anyone, and you know, everyone is pointing out that today, we are talking about this one guy who actually doctored evidence, but in that court document today, it also showed that the F.B.I. actually knew the entire time that Carter Page was an operational contact of the C.I.A. They withheld that in all of their spy warrants and that is a really big problem. CARLSON: Former Naval Officer, Carter Page, destroyed. Mollie, thank you. It is great to see you. That's it for us. Conventions next week. We will be here every single night, eight Eastern. \"Hannity\" next. Have a great weekend. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Retired NYPD lieutenant Joe Cardinale weighs in. The City of Seattle\u00a0held a racially segregated employee training session aimed at White staffers and instructing them on \"undoing your own whiteness\" in order to be held accountable by people of color, according to documents obtained by a public records request. The session took place on June 12, as\u00a0protesters\u00a0took part in the so-called \"Capitol Hill Organized Protest\" in the Capitol Hill district. One handout distributed in the session\u00a0declared how \u201cracism is not our fault but we are responsible.\" Another said White staffers must give up \u201cthe land\u201d and their \u201cguaranteed physical safety\u201d in order to be an \u201caccomplice\u201d for racial justice. LATEST SEATTLE CHOP SHOOTING KILLS 16-YEAR-OLD BOY, CRITICALLY WOUNDS 14-YEAR-OLD BOY Christopher F. Rufo, an editor for City Journal and director of the Discovery Institute\u2019s Center on Wealth and Poverty, said he filed a public records request regarding the training session.\u00a0On Monday, he published copies of the materials distributed to employees in the session on his Twitter account. The Discovery Institute has since shared copies of the documents obtained from the City of Seattle with Fox News. According to the documents, the Office of Civil Rights hosted a two-and-a-half-hour \u201cTraining on Internalized Racial Superiority for White People.\u201d In the email invitation to the event, the office asked\u00a0\u201ccity employees who identify as white to join this training to learn, reflect, challenge ourselves, and build skills and relationships that help us show up more fully as allies and accomplices for racial justice.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll examine our complicity in the system of white supremacy \u2013 how we internalize and reinforce it \u2013 and begin to cultivate practices that enable us to interrupt racism in ways to be accountable to Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) folks within our community,\u201d the email invitation\u00a0said. The name of the initial sender was redacted. Rufo claimed, \u201cthe City of Seattle has refused to provide the names of the diversity trainers, the budget for the program, or the video of the session.\u201d \u201cI'm going to keep pushing\u2014because this is exactly the kind of thought-policing they want to implement everywhere,\u201d Rufo tweeted. \u201cThe new cultural revolution is being fought via corporate HR, city diversity training, and public school curriculums. When you find something like this in your community, expose it, criticize it, mock it, and reject it.\u201d \"It's a dark irony that the City of Seattle's Office of Civil Rights would host racially segregated training sessions and demand that its white employees give up their 'physical safety' and 'white normative behavior,\u2019\u201d Rufo added in a statement to Fox News. \u201cThis new racial orthodoxy is now sweeping through local government, schools, and corporate HR departments, and threatens to undermine the American idea of equality under the law. The City of Seattle should immediately launch an investigation into this practice, change its policy on race-segregated training sessions, and abandon the cult-like ideology of 'critical race theory.'\" Those who attended the session were shown handouts, including one that encouraged them to cultivate \u201cnetworks with other white people who are practicing antiracist accomplicehood so you can talk through your struggles in the work of undoing your own whiteness.\u201d Diversity trainers instructed White employees in \u201cpracticing self-talk that affirms our complicity in racism.\u201d \u201cRacism is not our fault but we are responsible,\u201d one bullet point declared. In order to be considered \u201caccomplices,\u201d White employees must\u00a0give up \u201ccomfort,\u201d \u201cguaranteed physical safety,\u201d \u201cexpectations or presumptions of emotional safety,\u201d \u201ccontrol over other people and over the land,\u201d and \u201crelationships with some other white people.\u201d White employees were also urged to give up \u201cniceties from neighbors and colleagues,\u201d \u201cthe certainty of your job,\u201d and \u201caccepting jobs and promotions when we are not qualified, including racial equity jobs.\u201d Employees were presented with a flowchart that demonstrated how \u201cwhite people keep the system going\u201d by being socialized \u201cto cause harm to POC,\u201d \u201cjustify why we are superior and have been wronged by POC,\u201d \u201cuse anger, self-righteousness and defensiveness [to] mask fear, shame, or guilt,\u201d \u201cshow up small and inauthentic,\u201d and finally are \u201cunable to imagine a way forward that comes from a place of humanity,\u201d thus reinforcing the status quo. Those who attended the session were also shown a datasheet titled \u201cAssimilation into Whiteness,\u201d which claimed to document how those of Arab, Jewish, Finnish, German, Italian, Armenian or Irish descent still classify as White. SEATTLE CHOP BARRIERS BEING CLEARED BY CITY CREWS, COPS AT SCENE A sign on a barricade reads \"United we stand divided we fall,\" as a truck and other heavy equipment from the Seattle Department of Transportation is staged at the CHOP (Capitol Hill Occupied Protest) zone in Seattle, Friday, June 26, 2020. (AP) Employees were taught how to \u201cinterrupt\u201d their whiteness by being \u201chonest and implicate yourself either in the moment or in past experiences in which you acted or thought similarly.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t blame others.

I'm\u00a0Martha\u00a0MacCallum\u00a0and this is\u00a0THE\u00a0STORY\u00a0on\u00a0October 26. We have 8 days until\u00a0the\u00a0election. Voting is well under way,\u00a0across this country, 62 million people have already voted and tonight\u00a0President Trump's support is just about\u00a0within four points of Joe Biden and\u00a0that is according to\u00a0the\u00a0battleground states average at Real Clear\u00a0Politics.\u00a0You've got 55.5 to 49.5 and that's a collection of\u00a0the\u00a0six states that are\u00a0most likely to swing this election; Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin,\u00a0Florida along\u00a0with\u00a0North Carolina and Michigan so today\u00a0the\u00a0incumbent\u00a0worked Pennsylvania very hard, barnstorming all day long from Allentown\u00a0this morning, mid-day rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania and\u00a0then this afternoon\u00a0a third rally of\u00a0the\u00a0day around 4:30 this afternoon, that one in\u00a0Martinsburg, Pennsylvania.\u00a0The\u00a0president\u00a0with\u00a0his packed schedule went after Joe Biden's schedule.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF\u00a0THE\u00a0UNITED STATES: Sleepy Joe is down\u00a0there\u00a0and\u00a0they said you got to get out of this basement so he traveled from\u00a0Delaware to a little tiny corner in Pennsylvania like right next to\u00a0Delaware and he made a speech and he said that he doesn't do\u00a0these kind of\u00a0rallies because of COVID, you know.\u00a0No, he doesn't do that because nobody shows up.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: So very different, right? So\u00a0the\u00a0Biden camp which was expected\u00a0to be quiet today did as\u00a0the\u00a0president mentioned, changed\u00a0their tune. Late\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0day Joe Biden came out, he went up to that corner of Pennsylvania\u00a0from Delaware, he spoke in Chester, disputing that whole basement\u00a0narrative, watch this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm going to be going to Iowa, I'm\u00a0going to Wisconsin, I'm going to Georgia, I'm going to Florida and maybe\u00a0other places as well.\u00a0There's a lot we've been doing today. I've met today\u00a0with\u00a0group of leaders in\u00a0the\u00a0Democratic Party laying out where we're going\u00a0to go, getting our input and so we're constantly -\u00a0there has not been a day\u00a0that hasn't been a12 hour day yet.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: Also tonight it's very big night. Half past\u00a0the\u00a0hour, we will\u00a0take you to\u00a0the\u00a0Senate floor where\u00a0the\u00a0full floor will vote on Judge Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett. That expected confirmation will put conservatives at a 6-3\u00a0margin on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court, haven't seen that since\u00a0the\u00a01930 so big big\u00a0changes afoot.\u00a0Judge Barrett is an originalist in\u00a0the\u00a0tradition of Justice Scalia, doesn't\u00a0believe on legislating from\u00a0the\u00a0bench. She would replace Justice Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg. I'm going to take you live\u00a0there as that gets under way because\u00a0it is a historic vote this evening that we will watch together as it\u00a0unfolds.\u00a0We also expect a ceremony will follow at\u00a0the\u00a0White House and controversy\u00a0over that. We're going to get to new details on how that's going to look\u00a0and feel at around. That'll be around 9:00 this evening but we begin\u00a0tonight\u00a0with\u00a0Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W.\u00a0Bush and a Fox News Contributor.\u00a0Karl, great to see you tonight. Thanks for being here.\u00a0KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You bet\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So let's start\u00a0with\u00a0that Real Clear Politics average poll that\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0tightening of\u00a0the\u00a0race about 4.5 points between\u00a0the\u00a0two,\u00a0the\u00a0incumbent and former Vice President Joe Biden in those really important\u00a0states. How indicative is that do you think?\u00a0ROVE: Well, I think it's important but probably natural thing what is\u00a0happening here and particularly after\u00a0the\u00a0first debate performance for\u00a0President Trump,\u00a0there was a little bit of softening among his base but now\u00a0it's firming up and as we get to\u00a0the\u00a0end of\u00a0the\u00a0campaign, people tend to\u00a0return to\u00a0their corners. Republicans becoming Republicans, Democrats go\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0Democratic corner but you're right, I mean think about it.\u00a0These are\u00a0the\u00a0six states that were in\u00a0the\u00a0Real Clear Politics study. I know\u00a0from polls that I'm looking at in Arizona, private polls in Arizona, North\u00a0Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin that\u00a0the\u00a0numbers are tightening. In fact\u00a0I just was briefed on a poll in Wisconsin that had a 5000 person sample\u00a0that showed significant close into low single digits dividing\u00a0the\u00a0two\u00a0candidates.\u00a0So if that happens, think about it this way, if\u00a0the\u00a0president wins every\u00a0state, let's take\u00a0the\u00a0three Great Lake states; Pennsylvania, Michigan,\u00a0Wisconsin, put\u00a0them to\u00a0the\u00a0side for a second. If\u00a0the\u00a0president wins every\u00a0one of\u00a0the\u00a0rest of\u00a0the\u00a0states he won in 2016 and carry's Pennsylvania, he's\u00a0got 280 electoral votes, 10 more than needed.\u00a0If he carries Wisconsin out of those three states, only Wisconsin he's got\u00a0270. If he carries Michigan out of those three states and loses\u00a0Pennsylvania, Wisconsin; he's got 276.\u00a0So\u00a0the\u00a0path to victory lies in\u00a0these states that\u00a0the\u00a0president carries all\u00a0of\u00a0these, carries Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and\u00a0then he just needs\u00a0one more of\u00a0these states and\u00a0the\u00a0most dangerous one is Wisconsin though\u00a0because if he's at 270, if he loses either Maine two or Nebraska two\u00a0then\u00a0we've either got a tie in\u00a0the\u00a0electoral college if he loses one or he's\u00a0down by two if he loses both of\u00a0them.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes gosh, I mean it's going to be a very interesting night.\u00a0Here's Joe Biden. He's obviously concerned, he's going out on\u00a0the\u00a0trail,\u00a0you heard him. Now he's going to visit a number of states including\u00a0Wisconsin and he's trying really hard to correct what I think was probably\u00a0the\u00a0most significant take away from\u00a0the\u00a0final debate. Here's what he said\u00a0today.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BIDEN: I'm not shutting down oil fields. I'm not eliminating fracking. I'm\u00a0investing in clean energy, we're going to make sure that we don't continue\u00a0to subsidize\u00a0the\u00a0oil companies.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: What do you think Karl?\u00a0ROVE: Look, first of all, he has said on a number of times that he wants to\u00a0get rid of fracking, no ifs or buts about it and now he's saying I don't\u00a0want to get rid of\u00a0the\u00a0oil industry but he said that again on\u00a0the\u00a0record\u00a0several times and his policies would be devastating.\u00a0Kamala Harris, Senator Harris is coming to Houston on Friday apparently.\u00a0Think about this.\u00a0They have both said on\u00a0the\u00a0record and not step back from\u00a0saying that on\u00a0the\u00a0first day in office,\u00a0the\u00a0Biden-Harris administration\u00a0will ban fracking on federal lands and in federal waters and\u00a0they will -\u00a0they will stop leasing - oil leasing on federal lands and in federal\u00a0waters.\u00a0Houston is\u00a0the\u00a0capital city if you will of\u00a0the\u00a0Gulf of Mexico exploration\u00a0and production and you go in and say we're having no more leases in\u00a0the\u00a0Gulf of Mexico and we're not going to have fracking in federal lands and\u00a0federal waters. Well,\u00a0the\u00a0Gulf of Mexico is federal waters so you're going\u00a0to end fracking and a major basin for oil and gas production and devastate\u00a0the\u00a0Houston economy.\u00a0It won't just simply be\u00a0the\u00a0people in oil production, it's going to be\u00a0the\u00a0people working in\u00a0the\u00a0refineries and\u00a0the\u00a0people who are working in\u00a0the\u00a0chemical plants who depend upon\u00a0the\u00a0raw material coming out of\u00a0the\u00a0Gulf of\u00a0Mexico and elsewhere.\u00a0Second of all let me just make a quick point on this, it's amazing to be.\u00a0In\u00a0their plan and\u00a0they've never get stepped away from it,\u00a0they're going to\u00a0end\u00a0the\u00a0electricity production that comes from fossil fuels by 2035.70 percent of our electricity comes from fossil fuels, primarily natural\u00a0gas so if you're going to take all\u00a0these brand new natural gas plants that\u00a0are helping keep\u00a0the\u00a0utility prices low and reduce greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0and literally say\u00a0within 15 years, we don't care whether those plants are\u00a0still capable of running for decades more, you're out of business.\u00a0And incidentally, we're also going to force people to buy electric cars,\u00a0you're driving up demand for electricity and removing a substantial part of\u00a0the\u00a0capacity to generate electricity. That's a recipe for disaster and\u00a0again natural gas is big in Texas whether it's in\u00a0the\u00a0Gulf of Mexico or are\u00a0in Texas and Texas - land in Texas and--MACCALLUM: Karl, I want to play this other soundbite from Kamala Harris on\u00a060 minutes last night and get your thoughts on it but before I do that,\u00a0she's going to be in Texas as you pointed out. That's a pretty bold move to\u00a0send\u00a0the\u00a0vice presidential candidate to Texas. I don't think it's happened\u00a0since Lloyd Bentsen went\u00a0there and he was from Texas.\u00a0So does it - isn't that a sign of confidence on\u00a0their side.\u00a0ROVE: I think - I think it's cuborous because what it means is she comes\u00a0here on Friday, she's going to be met by every Republican candidate in\u00a0the\u00a0Houston area, pointing out how this is going to hurt\u00a0the\u00a0Texas economy and\u00a0she's going to dismean (ph)\u00a0the\u00a0closing note in Texas who is going to be.\u00a0All\u00a0the\u00a0Biden-Harris team says that\u00a0they're going to do to hurt oil and gas\u00a0in Texas.\u00a0Our principal source of revenue for our universities and for our public\u00a0schools, one of\u00a0the\u00a0biggest if not\u00a0the\u00a0biggest source of energy - of\u00a0revenue for schools and universities is oil and gas revenues from royalty\u00a0payments on state land.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes.\u00a0ROVE: I mean, this is a disaster for Texas.\u00a0MACCALLUM: All right, this was what her response was when she was asked\u00a0about being progressive and even socialist as a label. Interesting moment I\u00a0thought and questioning by Norah O'Donnell at CBS. Watch this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS HOST: And is that a socialist or progressive\u00a0perspective?\u00a0SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: No. It is\u00a0the\u00a0perspective of a woman who grew up a black child in America, who was also a\u00a0prosecutor, who also has a mother who arrived here at\u00a0the\u00a0age of 19 from\u00a0India. Who also you know likes hip hop. What do you want to know?\u00a0O'DONNELL: I want to give you - I want to give you\u00a0the--(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: Hmm. It went on after that. What do you think about that\u00a0exchange?\u00a0ROVE: I think a weird answer and clearly she didn't like\u00a0the\u00a0question.\u00a0Remember,\u00a0the\u00a0National Journal, a respected nonpartisan publication, ranks\u00a0her, looked at all of her votes in\u00a0the\u00a0Senate and ranked her as\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0liberal member of\u00a0the\u00a0United States Senate.\u00a0Look at what you said during her fledgling campaign for president in 2019.\u00a0This woman is on\u00a0the\u00a0far left of American politics and supported for\u00a0example one of\u00a0the\u00a0- one of\u00a0the\u00a0co-sponsors of\u00a0the\u00a0Green New Deal, endorsed\u00a0Medicare for all. I mean this woman is on\u00a0the\u00a0left of American politics.\u00a0She doesn't like being asked that question so she dodges best as she could,\u00a0was one of\u00a0the\u00a0weirdest laughs I think I've ever heard of any politician\u00a0that I've seen in decades.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean it seems like\u00a0the\u00a0answer is pretty easy and it's\u00a0when she said before which is you know I would be\u00a0the\u00a0vice president so I'm\u00a0going to you know carry out\u00a0the\u00a0policies of\u00a0the\u00a0president but you're right,\u00a0it appears she didn't like\u00a0the\u00a0question at all and it was an interesting,\u00a0interesting answer. Karl, thank you very much. Great to have you\u00a0with\u00a0us\u00a0tonight. We'll see you soon.\u00a0ROVE: Thanks\u00a0Martha. You bet.\u00a0MACCALLUM: You bet. So as we mentioned, record shattering 62.6 million\u00a0votes have already been cast in\u00a0the\u00a02020 presidential election, although\u00a0all of\u00a0the\u00a0pundits say that we shouldn't take away too much from that in\u00a0terms of\u00a0the\u00a0outcome. 40 million of\u00a0them have been sent through\u00a0the\u00a0mail.\u00a0Correspondent David Spunt is live in Washington tonight tracking those\u00a0numbers and some of\u00a0the\u00a0irregularities that have happened as well. Hi\u00a0David.\u00a0DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi\u00a0Martha\u00a0good evening, that 62\u00a0million number you mentioned is interesting and significant because it\u00a0surpasses\u00a0the\u00a0number of total early voting in 2016 just four years ago.\u00a0So clearly a lot of people out voting, a lot of energy for this election\u00a0but still,\u00a0there are some problems and some irregularities. Let's go to\u00a0Boston, Massachusetts where authorities announced\u00a0the\u00a0arrest of a man\u00a0they\u00a0say, set a ballot box on fire.\u00a0This was in coordination\u00a0with\u00a0local authorities and\u00a0the\u00a0FBI, early Sunday\u00a0morning just after 4:00 AM, Eastern Time. Boston firefighters were called\u00a0to a scene\u00a0with\u00a0smoke coming from that ballot box. To stop\u00a0the\u00a0fire, crews\u00a0had to literally fill up\u00a0the\u00a0burning box\u00a0with\u00a0water.\u00a0The\u00a0ballots inside\u00a0were charred and wet but 87 of\u00a0the\u00a0approximately 122 ballots inside can be\u00a0processed.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a really scary time in democracy right\u00a0now. I hope that\u00a0there's a way to count\u00a0the\u00a0ballots that were lost.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we're going to be beefing up security in and\u00a0around ballot boxes. It's also a way so intimidate people not to vote.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0SPUNT:\u00a0The\u00a0suspect 39 year old Worldy Armand, he's in custody right now.\u00a0The\u00a0local district attorney said she believes\u00a0the\u00a0man is emotionally\u00a0disturbed and not part of a larger effort to disrupt voting, still chilling\u00a0to see\u00a0Martha. Now this comes as early voting number showed Democrats ahead\u00a0in several key states.\u00a0In Florida 2.5 million Democrats to 2.2 million Republicans have already\u00a0voted. Let's take a look at North Carolina where\u00a0the\u00a0Vice President is\u00a0spending quite a bit of time this week. Almost 1.3 million Americans have\u00a0voted - Democrats I should say have voted to 952,000 Republicans but look\u00a0not far behind\u00a0Martha, 924,000 independents.And finally in Pennsylvania where President Trump made three stops today,\u00a0former vice president Joe Biden also stopped as well, 1.2 million Democrats\u00a0have voted early while only 350,000 Republicans have voted early.\u00a0Of course we still have a week,\u00a0there is still time. Speaking of\u00a0Pennsylvania, President Trump is talking about having poll watchers in\u00a0the\u00a0city of Philadelphia. Meanwhile state officials have said no, city\u00a0officials have said no and a state judge said that's not going to happen.\u00a0The\u00a0Trump campaign continuing to fight that battle in court,\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM: David Spunt, thank you very much.\u00a0SPUNT: You bet.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So tonight Judge Amy Coney Barrett is about to become an\u00a0associate justice of\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court. Her process could not have been\u00a0more different really than\u00a0the\u00a0beleaguered path that we watched last time\u00a0around\u00a0with\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0The\u00a0criticism from Democrats were more on process than character and in\u00a0the\u00a0end,\u00a0the\u00a0process while rushed and some would say impolitic was\u00a0legislatively and constitutionally sound. We're told\u00a0the\u00a0Vice President\u00a0will not attend having been exposed to staffers\u00a0with\u00a0COVID-19, he was asked\u00a0not to attend by Senator Schumer.\u00a0It appears that no tie breaking vote will be needed. We do expect\u00a0the\u00a0swearing in ceremony to follow tonight at\u00a0the\u00a0White House. A senior White\u00a0House official telling Fox that Justice Clarence Thomas will administer\u00a0the\u00a0constitutional oath to Judge Barrett.\u00a0In moments Republican Senator Thom Tillis joins me but we begin\u00a0with\u00a0Democrat Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, both members of\u00a0the\u00a0Judiciary\u00a0Committee. Senator, good to have you\u00a0with\u00a0us tonight. Your thoughts as we\u00a0prepare for\u00a0the\u00a0final vote tonight on\u00a0the\u00a0Senate floor, Sir.\u00a0SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well\u00a0Martha, I'm glad to hear that Vice President\u00a0Pence will not be joining us, given that five members of his senior team\u00a0are infected\u00a0with\u00a0COVID-19 and I'm frankly still concerned and upset that\u00a0we are having this process where\u00a0the\u00a0Republican majority is rushing through\u00a0Judge Barrett.\u00a0Never in American history has\u00a0there been a confirmation vote for a Supreme\u00a0Court justice just eight days before presidential elections where a\u00a0majority of states are already voting. And I'll remind you and your viewers\u00a0that four years ago,\u00a0the\u00a0Republican majority insisted on not holding a\u00a0hearing or a vote on a highly qualified nominee by President Obama for 10\u00a0months.\u00a0I don't think we should be having this vote. I think we should be\u00a0delivering relief to American people.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0There was a difference. He didn't hold\u00a0the\u00a0Senate majority at\u00a0the\u00a0time and that's what\u00a0the\u00a0Republicans have said is\u00a0the\u00a0major reason for\u00a0the\u00a0different situation. Obviously,\u00a0there's a lot of bad feeling over\u00a0the\u00a0way that this was carried out but none\u00a0the\u00a0less as I mentioned, it is a\u00a0constitutionally and legislatively sound process in terms of moving\u00a0forward.\u00a0The\u00a0President has\u00a0the\u00a0right to nominate and tonight she will ultimately be\u00a0sworn in if\u00a0the\u00a0vote goes as expected. I know that you have a lot of\u00a0concerns about ACA and you know it struck me that all of\u00a0the\u00a0pictures of\u00a0the\u00a0faces that we have seen on those photos during this process of people\u00a0who are taking advantage of\u00a0the\u00a0pre-existing condition clause in\u00a0the\u00a0ACA,\u00a0really proves that\u00a0without disapproves -\u00a0there's a question for you - does\u00a0it prove that\u00a0without\u00a0the\u00a0-\u00a0without\u00a0the\u00a0mandatory buy-in that it does still\u00a0stand.\u00a0The\u00a0fact that people are using\u00a0the\u00a0program,\u00a0they're using ACA and\u00a0there's\u00a0no mandatory commitment to buy ACA proves that\u00a0without that, which has been\u00a0eliminated from\u00a0the\u00a0- from\u00a0the\u00a0program, it does stand and it does work,\u00a0correct?\u00a0COONS: Well\u00a0Martha, if I can be clear. First, just earlier today at\u00a0Westside Health in Wilmington, Delaware, I did a press conference\u00a0with\u00a0Kerry for Middle town who's been a part of my argument about\u00a0the\u00a0thousands\u00a0of Delawareans,\u00a0the\u00a0majority of Delawareans who rely on\u00a0the\u00a0Affordable Care\u00a0Act to protect\u00a0them from either pre-existing condition discrimination by\u00a0insurance companies or discrimination based on being women.\u00a0She's a small business owner, she has three pre-existing conditions and she\u00a0has been able to access more affordable health care because of\u00a0these\u00a0protections of\u00a0the\u00a0ACA.\u00a0MACCALLUM: That's exactly my point.\u00a0COONS:\u00a0The\u00a0second and most importantly as you well know\u00a0Martha,\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court will be hearing a constitutional challenge to\u00a0the\u00a0Affordable Care\u00a0Act, a week from\u00a0the\u00a0election, just two weeks from tomorrow and President\u00a0Trump himself last night on 60 Minutes said he hopes\u00a0the\u00a0Affordable Care\u00a0Act will be overturned and done away\u00a0with\u00a0and he still has no plan for how\u00a0to replace it in\u00a0the\u00a0middle of a pandemic.\u00a0MACCALLUM: But whatever he hopes is regardless - I'm only making\u00a0the\u00a0point\u00a0that when she talked about\u00a0the\u00a0Jenga Tower, right?\u00a0The\u00a0individual mandate's\u00a0already been pulled out and\u00a0the\u00a0ACA is still standing because people are\u00a0still using it. All those photographs that were shown so that would - that\u00a0would substantiate\u00a0the\u00a0perspective that she has based on what she told us\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0hearing that she would say that it could be severed and\u00a0(inaudible)\u00a0So I think it's going to be very interesting.\u00a0COONS: That's profoundly misleading\u00a0Martha. That's not what she said.\u00a0MACCALLUM: How so?COONS: She did not reach\u00a0the\u00a0question of severability so Judge Barrett did\u00a0not say--MACCALLUM: No, she said - she said--COONS: --in front of\u00a0the\u00a0judiciary hearing that she committed to upholding\u00a0the\u00a0Affordable Care Act.\u00a0MACCALLUM: No, of course not.\u00a0COONS: --even if\u00a0the\u00a0mandate is unconstitutional.\u00a0MACCALLUM: She would never do that. That wouldn't be part of\u00a0the\u00a0process.\u00a0COONS: Right.\u00a0MACCALLUM: However\u00a0the\u00a0example that she gave was that if for any law, if\u00a0you pull a piece out and it still stands\u00a0then it can be severed out and\u00a0the\u00a0laws can still stand, which is what we just demonstrated is right now\u00a0happening\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0ACA. I'm not saying that she said she would uphold it.\u00a0I'm saying that\u00a0the\u00a0example that she gave is exactly what we see playing\u00a0out right now\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0ACA so we'll all watch together--COONS: I agree\u00a0with\u00a0you\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM: --as she makes that decision on November 10.\u00a0COONS: Today\u00a0the\u00a0Affordable Care Act is working--MACCALLUM: We'll see what happens.\u00a0COONS: --but two weeks from now it is at risk for a majority of Americans.\u00a0That's exactly why.\u00a0MACCALLUM: But it would have to be proved and\u00a0the\u00a0severability cause will\u00a0fall apart. Let me ask you one more question before I let you go because\u00a0you're getting a lot of attention as someone who could become\u00a0the\u00a0next\u00a0Secretary of State if Joe Biden becomes\u00a0the\u00a0next president and you've made\u00a0it pretty clear that that is\u00a0the\u00a0job that you would want.\u00a0Have you had discussions\u00a0with\u00a0him about that?\u00a0COONS: Joe Biden's been clear that he is focused on winning this next\u00a0election on making his case to\u00a0the\u00a0American people about how he can bring\u00a0us together, get us through this pandemic and help us build back better.\u00a0Conversations about positions like that will begin if relevant more than\u00a0eight days from now.\u00a0So we have not had a conversation about that position and who he would or\u00a0wouldn't choose, he has some very talented people to choose from. I'd be\u00a0honored to be considered but we can't get ahead of ourselves.\u00a0There's still\u00a0a lot of campaigning to do in\u00a0the\u00a0remaining eight days\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0There sure is. OK, thank you very much Senator. Good to have you\u00a0here.\u00a0COONS: Thank you.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Thank you. So now joined by Republican Senator Thom Tillis of\u00a0North Carolina. He is also on\u00a0the\u00a0Judiciary Committee. Senator, good to\u00a0have you\u00a0with\u00a0us this evening. Your thoughts as we prepare for this vote\u00a0tonight.\u00a0SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): Well, I'm going to be taking a walk over to\u00a0the\u00a0chamber here as soon as we finish this interview. I'm going to proudly cast\u00a0my vote for an incredible nominee for\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court. Brilliant,\u00a0successful jurist, successful mom of seven children.It was very interesting in\u00a0the\u00a0hearings that we sat through, just how her\u00a0credentials and her capabilities came across. That's why\u00a0they started - my\u00a0colleagues on\u00a0the\u00a0other side of\u00a0the\u00a0aisle started this whole false\u00a0narrative that you just heard Chris lay out. Now Chris is a good friend of\u00a0mine but I completely disagree\u00a0with\u00a0him.I think that Judge Barrett's going to do a great job.\u00a0The\u00a0Supreme Court is\u00a0going to benefit greatly by having her on it.\u00a0MACCALLUM: When you take a look at\u00a0the\u00a0things that will come before her, we\u00a0were just talking about\u00a0the\u00a0ACA on November 10.\u00a0There are a lot of people\u00a0who think that she might be more open to overturning at least some of\u00a0the\u00a0building blocks that are included in Roe V. Wade, what do you think\u00a0the\u00a0court is going to look like in\u00a0the\u00a0future as a 6-3 conservative majority?TILLIS:\u00a0Martha,\u00a0the\u00a0first thing people need to understand is\u00a0the\u00a0ACA is not\u00a0going to go away in a matter of a couple of weeks.\u00a0They are taking a look\u00a0at some of\u00a0the\u00a0elements of\u00a0the\u00a0act that are arguably unconstitutional and\u00a0what\u00a0they're really going to tell us if Congress wants to pass a law that\u00a0stands constitutional muster, that's our job, it's not\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court.\u00a0So I think that we'll see\u00a0the\u00a0hearings as after Judge Barrett gets seated\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court but I think\u00a0the\u00a0American people need to understand\u00a0that Republicans have voted five times to protect pre-existing conditions.\u00a0There is a super majority of members who are going to protect\u00a0them\u00a0regardless of what\u00a0the\u00a0court does and\u00a0they need to stop\u00a0the\u00a0scare tactics\u00a0to try and win an election.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I want to play what\u00a0the\u00a0Mayor of Washington DC, Mayor Bowser\u00a0said about\u00a0the\u00a0possibility that\u00a0there might be another ceremony this\u00a0evening at\u00a0the\u00a0White House for Amy Coney Barrett and we all remember that\u00a0you and others became ill\u00a0with\u00a0COVID-19 after attending that. Here's what\u00a0she said.\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER (D) WASHINGTON DC: For all you know you could be packed\u00a0in a Rose Garden event\u00a0with\u00a0somebody sitting next to you hacking. Now ask\u00a0yourself, if that's happening are you going to get up and leave in\u00a0the\u00a0middle of\u00a0the\u00a0president's remarks? If you're not, you shouldn't go.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: What do you think about\u00a0the\u00a0fact that\u00a0they are discussing a\u00a0ceremony. Do you know what it's going to look like and where it's going to\u00a0be and how many people will be\u00a0there?\u00a0TILLIS: I don't have all\u00a0the\u00a0details, I'm not going to be attending\u00a0tonight. I have other commitments and I'm looking forward to\u00a0the\u00a0formal\u00a0investiture when Judge Barrett moves into session but\u00a0the\u00a0reality is\u00a0everything that\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats are saying now are shifting attention away\u00a0from policies that\u00a0they know would be difficult for\u00a0them to get elected if\u00a0you have informed ballot.\u00a0I heard Karl Rove talk about destroying\u00a0the\u00a0energy industry. We all want\u00a0renewable energy but in Pennsylvania and Texas, Ohio, that's a serious\u00a0issue and it's a real threat. You got Senator Harris laughing at\u00a0the\u00a0idea\u00a0of being a socialist but she's more liberal in this Congress than Bernie\u00a0Sanders who is a self-avowed Democrats socialist.\u00a0So I think that\u00a0they'll do anything to shift\u00a0their attention away from what\u00a0they really stand for. It's higher taxes more regulations and a lot of jobs\u00a0lost.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So we had a piece by reporter David Spunt a few minutes ago\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0voting process thus far and some irregularities that have been\u00a0seen so\u00a0there's a court decision\u00a0with\u00a0regard to North Carolina and I want\u00a0you to tell us where it is in\u00a0the\u00a0process right now because\u00a0the\u00a0discussion\u00a0is to extend\u00a0the\u00a0counting until November 12.\u00a0As I understand it, all\u00a0the\u00a0ballots would have to be postmarked by\u00a0the\u00a0third but could potentially be counted all\u00a0the\u00a0way out to\u00a0the\u00a012th. Where\u00a0does that stand?\u00a0TILLIS: Well,\u00a0there were elements of what\u00a0the\u00a0board of elections voted on\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0court have prevented from going into place but we've already\u00a0allowed those to be counted three days after\u00a0the\u00a0election so this is adding\u00a0six additional days.\u00a0I still feel confident in absentee ballot voting. I've got my absentee\u00a0ballot. I'm actually going to hand deliver it because I've been up here\u00a0unexpectedly and I decided that I'll hand deliver when my wife and I vote\u00a0but it's a process that I think works.\u00a0The\u00a0fact that it's going to be nine\u00a0days after\u00a0the\u00a0election before we get\u00a0the\u00a0total vote as close as this\u00a0election's going to be, it probably won't be called on Tuesday night.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Incredible. We'll be\u00a0there. Thank you very much Senator Tillis.\u00a0Good to speak\u00a0with\u00a0you tonight. We'll be watching your race of course in\u00a0North Carolina, such an important state in\u00a0the\u00a0presidential race as well.\u00a0Thank you Sir.\u00a0TILLIS: Thank you\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Bret Baier and Shannon Bream are here as we await\u00a0the\u00a0historic\u00a0Senate vote on\u00a0the\u00a0confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0United States, next.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0MACCALLUM: Exactly one month since President Trump announced Judge Amy\u00a0Coney Barett as his pick for\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court.\u00a0The\u00a0Senate is now just\u00a0moments away from a vote. A very, very quick process that we have watched\u00a0play out and that vote is expected to solidify her place on\u00a0the\u00a0High Court\u00a0and to fill\u00a0the\u00a0vacancy of\u00a0the\u00a0late liberal icon, Justice Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg.\u00a0Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram. Chad Pergram is live on Capitol\u00a0Hill tonight watching all of this is we anticipate this big moment. Hi\u00a0Chad, good evening.\u00a0CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey\u00a0there. Good\u00a0evening. Well, this is\u00a0the\u00a0last speech before\u00a0they actually go to\u00a0the\u00a0formal confirmation process. Mitch McConnell,\u00a0the\u00a0Senate Majority Leader is\u00a0talking on\u00a0the\u00a0floor right now. You know yesterday we kept saying that we\u00a0thought that this vote would start sometime around 7:26.\u00a0Now that's kind of an odd time.\u00a0The\u00a0reason is\u00a0the\u00a0end of\u00a0the\u00a0procedural\u00a0vote to end\u00a0the\u00a0filibuster yesterday afternoon at 1.26 p.m. Eastern Time.\u00a0By rule on a culture vote as it's called here on Capitol Hill, that's what\u00a0you vote on to actually end a filibuster, opponents of an issue get 30\u00a0extra hours so\u00a0they closed\u00a0the\u00a0vote yesterday at 1.26, that's why we are\u00a0about to go to this confirmation vote now.\u00a0Now timing in\u00a0the\u00a0United States Senate is not exactly swift and that's why\u00a0things are drifting a little bit later here and\u00a0they always give deference\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell and also\u00a0the\u00a0Minority\u00a0Leader, Chuck Schumer.\u00a0We might have a procedural vote here first just to take attendance. So,\u00a0they'll roll through that pretty quickly. Usually on a vote of this\u00a0magnitude senators would vote from\u00a0their desks. That might not be\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0this time due to\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic.\u00a0Now, Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said on\u00a0the\u00a0day that Ruth\u00a0Bader Ginsburg died that she opposed forging ahead\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0nomination so\u00a0close to an election. Ginsburg died a few hours later. Murkowski is\u00a0splitting\u00a0the\u00a0atom here. She voted twice in recent days against ending a\u00a0filibuster on\u00a0the\u00a0nomination but Murkowski says\u00a0the\u00a0Senate should confirm\u00a0Barrett on\u00a0the\u00a0merits she is a \"yes.\" One Republican told Fox that\u00a0Murkowski's maneuvers were, quote, \"too cute by half.\" Listen.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI, (R-AK):\u00a0 At\u00a0the\u00a0end of\u00a0the\u00a0process is\u00a0the\u00a0substantive\u00a0question of whether Judge Barrett should be categorically rejected as an\u00a0associate justice in order to underscore my procedural objection.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0PERGRAM:\u00a0 Now we are expecting 52 Republican ayes,\u00a0the\u00a0only no likely to be\u00a0Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, she faces a difficult reelection\u00a0bid in Maine this fall.\u00a0Now this is\u00a0the\u00a0latest that\u00a0they have ever considered a Supreme Court\u00a0nominee this close to a presidential election. You have to go back to Frank\u00a0Murphy, Justice Frank Murphy, who was confirmed in January of 1940, that\u00a0was a presidential election year. Benjamin Cardozo in February of 1932 also\u00a0a presidential election year and as for a lame duck congress, you had\u00a0William Woods confirmed December 21st, 1880. He was nominated by Rutherford\u00a0B. Hayes. Back to you.\u00a0MARTHA\u00a0MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0 I want to be your partner in jeopardy,\u00a0Chad. Thank you very much. Chad Pergram, always has all of\u00a0the\u00a0history for\u00a0us from Capitol Hill. Thank you very much, Chad.\u00a0PERGRAM:\u00a0 Thank you.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Bret Baier joins me now, chief political anchor and host of\u00a0Special Report\u00a0with\u00a0Bret Baier. Bret, good evening to you. Great to have\u00a0you\u00a0with\u00a0us tonight.\u00a0BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0 Good evening. What is a great jeopardy\u00a0partner?\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You know -- exactly. Chad Pergram. Ding, ding for all\u00a0the\u00a0money.\u00a0So, I'm watching Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell here on\u00a0the\u00a0floor\u00a0and I'm thinking about what he must be feeling tonight because he has\u00a0secured a legacy for himself in a huge number, over 200 federal court --\u00a0federal judges, three Supreme Court justices after tonight. So, this has\u00a0been really one of\u00a0the\u00a0most important parts I think of his legacy and it's\u00a0a big moment for him tonight.\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 A big moment and a big victory for\u00a0the\u00a0Republican majority in\u00a0the\u00a0Senate. Remember that it's not just\u00a0the\u00a0three Supreme Court justices. It's\u00a0really\u00a0the\u00a0dozens and dozens of other federal judges --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BAIER:\u00a0 -- that will affect\u00a0the\u00a0courts for decades to come and he talked\u00a0about that just\u00a0the\u00a0other day. But just to point out how partisan and how\u00a0upset Democrats are, Chuck Schumer just a few moments ago said this will be\u00a0one of\u00a0the\u00a0darkest days in\u00a0the\u00a0history of\u00a0the\u00a0231-year history of\u00a0the\u00a0United States Senate. He said Republicans are thwarting\u00a0the\u00a0will of\u00a0the\u00a0people,\u00a0the\u00a0American people and he went on to say that you will no longer -- when Democrats control this chamber, you will have forfeited your right\u00a0to tell us how to run that majority.\u00a0And that obviously,\u00a0Martha, is a hat tip to what may come if Democrats do\u00a0control\u00a0the\u00a0Senate and that is all of\u00a0the\u00a0talk about doing something --\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BAIER:\u00a0 -- to change\u00a0the\u00a0court system and possibly court pack\u00a0the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Absolutely. You know, that is a huge question here because\u00a0Democrats will have to decide what levers are at\u00a0their disposal and whether\u00a0or not\u00a0they think that that is a move too far or whether\u00a0they could be\u00a0justified, it's a six-three conservative majority and it is a young group\u00a0of justices who would likely be\u00a0there for very long time.\u00a0Let's take a look at this poll, New York Times/Siena poll. Fifty-eight\u00a0percent say\u00a0they are opposed to\u00a0the\u00a0idea of packing\u00a0the\u00a0court. Thirty-one\u00a0percent in favor of that. Do you think that politically Democrats will\u00a0ultimately decide that that's a good way to go, Bret?\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 If\u00a0they control\u00a0the\u00a0chamber\u00a0there's going to be a lot of pressure\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0progressive side not only on --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BAIER:\u00a0 -- Joe Biden if he wins\u00a0the\u00a0presidency, but on Chuck Schumer as\u00a0the\u00a0head of\u00a0the\u00a0Democratic Senate, if all of that happens. That's a big if\u00a0eight days from election but if it did, I think\u00a0there would be a lot of\u00a0pressure to change something, but\u00a0they'll be institutionalist on\u00a0the\u00a0Democratic side as well who fight this, just like\u00a0they did when FDR\u00a0proposed it years and years and years ago.\u00a0Speaking about polls,\u00a0Martha, quickly, when Chuck Schumer says thwart\u00a0the\u00a0will of\u00a0the\u00a0American people,\u00a0there are some polls in recent days that have\u00a0said do you approve of\u00a0the\u00a0confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\u00a0This is Huffington Post/YouGov. Not exactly a right leaning poll.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BAIER:\u00a0 Nine points, yes. twenty-three points in Morning Consul poll, yes,\u00a0we support that. That's a -- shows how well she did in that confirmation\u00a0hearing. And you know, it's a couple of polls, but it's interesting.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. I think it's very interesting. She definitely went a long\u00a0way to winning over people who may have not been inclined to support her\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0course of those hearings as we all watched\u00a0the\u00a0lessons play out\u00a0in those discussions.\u00a0ACA, you probably heard my conversation\u00a0with\u00a0Senators Tillis and Coons a\u00a0moment ago. This is a big issue that is before\u00a0the\u00a0court November 10th and\u00a0it's also a huge issue in\u00a0the\u00a0election of course, Bret.\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Obviously, and you know, Democrats say that this is all about\u00a0tearing down Obamacare. I think\u00a0the\u00a0president said that in\u00a0the\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0interview --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BAIER:\u00a0 -- pretty clearly, he'd like to see that done, but how it happens --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 That's right.BAIER:\u00a0 -- whether it would happen is a long shot\u00a0with, as you know, how\u00a0the\u00a0course -- court,\u00a0the\u00a0case is structured.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Absolutely. Let's bring in Shannon. Bret is going to stay\u00a0with\u00a0us as we see\u00a0the\u00a0live shot here on\u00a0the\u00a0Senate floor. Mitch McConnell giving\u00a0opening comments and some procedural issues as we get started here tonight.\u00a0Shannon, so great to have you\u00a0with\u00a0us to watch all of this play out.\u00a0Shannon Bream is\u00a0the\u00a0anchor of Fox News at Night and our chief legal\u00a0correspondent of course. Give me your big picture look as we prepare for\u00a0this, Shannon.\u00a0SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT & ANCHOR:\u00a0 Listen, she's going to be\u00a0able to get to work right away,\u00a0Martha.\u00a0There are two oaths that a new\u00a0justice takes. One of those we would see we expect tonight was Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas. And remember she clerked for Justice Scalia. Years ago,\u00a0Justice Thomas was already on\u00a0the\u00a0bench than so\u00a0they certainly have a\u00a0relationship and know each other so a former clerk now joining\u00a0the\u00a0bench,\u00a0as often happens in recent years. And so, he is\u00a0the\u00a0one chosen to swear her\u00a0in tonight.There's a second oath, though. So once those are both taken by her, she\u00a0literally will be an official justice and working.\u00a0They are getting\u00a0emergency appeals every day now and many of\u00a0them have to deal\u00a0with\u00a0voting\u00a0procedures in\u00a0the\u00a0states.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BREAM:\u00a0\u00a0They will have a conference\u00a0then on Friday where\u00a0they vote on\u00a0the\u00a0cases that\u00a0they'll eventually take up and that she has to go big cases, one\u00a0right out of\u00a0the\u00a0gate next week and\u00a0then that ACA case on\u00a0the\u00a0tenth. I\u00a0watched your fabulous interview\u00a0with\u00a0Senator coons and I thought it was a\u00a0bit disingenuous that he continues to try to represent that she hadn't\u00a0talked about severability.\u00a0You and I remember, all of us who watched, she talked about that Jenga game\u00a0and how you pull out that piece and try to keep\u00a0the\u00a0rest of\u00a0the\u00a0law\u00a0together. So, to say she didn't talk about it, anybody who watched her\u00a0confirmation hearings knows that she did,\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. And obviously we'll all be watching to see how she might\u00a0make that decision and whether her Jenga tower falls down on November 10th\u00a0when those conversations begin.\u00a0I want to just stay\u00a0with\u00a0you for a moment here, Shannon. It's interesting\u00a0to look at\u00a0the\u00a0composition of\u00a0the\u00a0court\u00a0with\u00a0Justice Barrett as\u00a0the\u00a0ninth\u00a0justice and from everything that I'm looking at,\u00a0they place her sort of\u00a0with\u00a0Thomas and Alito to\u00a0the\u00a0right of her and\u00a0then her and\u00a0then Gorsuch and\u00a0Kavanaugh, making him sort of\u00a0the\u00a0central person in that nine. Explain to\u00a0everybody what that means. What's\u00a0the\u00a0significance of that?\u00a0BREAM:\u00a0 I think it can mean a couple of big things.\u00a0There are whispers that\u00a0this now become\u00a0the\u00a0Thomas court, that Justice Clarence Thomas who has been\u00a0there for some 29 years would be\u00a0the\u00a0one who would be sort of\u00a0the\u00a0thought\u00a0leader on\u00a0the\u00a0conservative side. He is a prolific writer, whether he's in\u00a0the\u00a0majority or\u00a0the\u00a0dissent or concurrence. He has a lot to say. Maybe not\u00a0verbally, people will know that he doesn't say a lot from\u00a0the\u00a0bench but\u00a0he's had a lot to say on paper recently about things like\u00a0the\u00a0second\u00a0amendment, religious liberty and where that clashes\u00a0with\u00a0LGBTQ rights.\u00a0I mean, he's very vociferous in\u00a0the\u00a0things he thinks\u00a0the\u00a0court needs to be\u00a0taking on. And\u00a0with\u00a0her vote\u00a0they are probably going many times going to\u00a0align\u00a0with\u00a0him and Justice Alito that he may become more of\u00a0the\u00a0leader of\u00a0that conservative wing. It seems like it would make sense.\u00a0Also, her adding to\u00a0the\u00a0court will probably take away this idea that\u00a0the\u00a0chief justice has been\u00a0the\u00a0swing vote. In many key cases recently it much\u00a0more will be interesting to watch how he decides what to do\u00a0with\u00a0his vote.\u00a0He's not going to want to go\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0liberal minority if\u00a0they are often\u00a0the\u00a0minority, those three, he's not going to want to be\u00a0the\u00a0fourth. It\u00a0takes away his ability to write\u00a0the\u00a0majority opinion or to really be a\u00a0swing vote.\u00a0I would think it's going to mean that he more often will probably line up\u00a0with\u00a0five or six on\u00a0the\u00a0other side\u00a0then he will in\u00a0the\u00a0minority. So, a lot\u00a0of potential changes\u00a0with\u00a0her joining\u00a0the\u00a0court and we could see that\u00a0influence very quickly because of\u00a0these prominent cases.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. Bret, when you look at this from a political perspective,\u00a0it's obviously a win for President Trump. He claims that his promise to\u00a0appoint conservative justices and judges was a big winning point for him\u00a0back in 2016. How much weight may it or may it not hold this time around,\u00a0though?\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Well, I think it's a big win for Republicans, conservatives are\u00a0very happy about it. However, I don't see\u00a0them talking about it a lot on\u00a0the\u00a0trail. In part because I think it really fires up\u00a0the\u00a0left and it gets\u00a0the\u00a0left really fired up to get out\u00a0the\u00a0vote and to possibly influence what\u00a0could be court packing to come. So, I don't think it's a political issue.\u00a0It's a great thing, but as far as a victory that\u00a0the\u00a0president can list,\u00a0he's delivering on\u00a0the\u00a0promises that he started\u00a0with.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Standby, both of you. Bret and Shannon, great to have you\u00a0with\u00a0us tonight. It seems that\u00a0the\u00a0majority leader is sort of soaking up\u00a0the\u00a0moment here and he is holding court on\u00a0the\u00a0floor of\u00a0the\u00a0Senate so we are\u00a0waiting for\u00a0the\u00a0vote to get underway.And I want to bring in Jonathan Turley, George Washington law professor and\u00a0Fox News contributor. Always great to have you\u00a0with\u00a0us, Jonathan. Thanks\u00a0for being here tonight.\u00a0What are you thinking?\u00a0JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Thank you.MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You know, she will be\u00a0the\u00a0115th Supreme Court justice on\u00a0the\u00a0court. That's not a lot of people when you look at\u00a0the\u00a0size of our country.\u00a0It's an incredibly special moment for\u00a0the\u00a0country. So, talk to me about\u00a0what you see unfolding tonight before you.\u00a0TURLEY:\u00a0 What you're about to see is perhaps\u00a0the\u00a0most important moment in\u00a0the\u00a0modern court's history. Her addition to\u00a0the\u00a0court promises to be\u00a0transformative for\u00a0the\u00a0court. She's\u00a0the\u00a0ultimate deliverable for President\u00a0Trump. You know, Republican presidents have insisted that\u00a0they would put on\u00a0the\u00a0court conservatives and also pro-life nominees. She is\u00a0the\u00a0ultimate\u00a0deliverable for that constituency.\u00a0She is -- she is incredibly smart, a very good writer, and she is also\u00a0thought deeply about\u00a0these issues. In many ways,\u00a0the\u00a0person she looks most\u00a0like is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I mean,\u00a0their resumes are very similar. You\u00a0know,\u00a0they both started in law school, graduate top of\u00a0their class,\u00a0then\u00a0went into teaching.\u00a0Then wrote a lot about procreational rights.\u00a0They just\u00a0reach different conclusions.\u00a0But\u00a0they are both coming to\u00a0the\u00a0court -- that is Ruth Bader Ginsburg came\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0court and she will come to\u00a0the\u00a0court as fully formed intellects when\u00a0it comes to jurisprudence.\u00a0They are not a work in progress in that sense.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 I think that's fascinating. I think\u00a0the\u00a0comparisons between\u00a0these two women and I think\u00a0the\u00a0way that we have all watched Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg over\u00a0the\u00a0years, I think that attention will go to Amy Coney\u00a0Barrett because she is just an interesting person to listen to and to\u00a0watch, especially for women across\u00a0the\u00a0country, so I think you make a great\u00a0point.\u00a0Standby for a moment, we are going to go back to Chad Pergram, who is\u00a0standing by, who is going to bring us\u00a0the\u00a0latest on how everything is\u00a0expected to play out here tonight.\u00a0They are a little bit behind schedule,\u00a0Chad.\u00a0PERGRAM:\u00a0 That's right. It's typical that\u00a0they give both\u00a0the\u00a0minority\u00a0leader and\u00a0the\u00a0majority leader a little bit of time before a confirmation\u00a0vote. Certainly, something of this magnitude. You know a lot of times\u00a0they\u00a0allocate time in\u00a0the\u00a0Senate by 10-minute blocks, half hour blocks and\u00a0things like that. Technically\u00a0they have overrun\u00a0the\u00a0time period as to when\u00a0they were to start here, but because it's\u00a0the\u00a0Senate majority leader and\u00a0out of deference to him, Mitch McConnell,\u00a0they're going to give him more\u00a0time.\u00a0Now again, just to reset what we are expecting here, once Mitch McConnell\u00a0concludes his remarks, is we expect to have a procedural vote, probably, we\u00a0don't know that 100 percent but probably have a procedural vote, take\u00a0attendance, a quorum call, this is where\u00a0they actually make sure\u00a0they\u00a0actually have a quorum to do business here. That will take probably 10\u00a0minutes at\u00a0the\u00a0most and\u00a0then\u00a0they will go to\u00a0the\u00a0actual confirmation vote\u00a0itself.\u00a0And again, that would probably take less time because you have most\u00a0senators in\u00a0the\u00a0chamber. Now under conventional circumstances, two things\u00a0would happen. You would usually have senators vote from\u00a0their desks.\u00a0They\u00a0don't want people milling around\u00a0the\u00a0Senate chamber, coming in and out of\u00a0the\u00a0cloakroom.\u00a0They want everybody\u00a0there because of\u00a0the\u00a0solemnity and\u00a0importance of\u00a0the\u00a0moment.\u00a0The\u00a0other thing that we are not going to have tonight is Mike Pence,\u00a0the\u00a0vice president, and\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution as president of\u00a0the\u00a0Senate, presiding\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0vote. You know, it was thought a few days ago that maybe if\u00a0they\u00a0had issues\u00a0with\u00a0health or if you had other senators who were going to vote\u00a0no on\u00a0the\u00a0Republican side, you know,\u00a0they were right down to\u00a0the\u00a0margin of\u00a0error here in terms of confirming\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court nominee and you might\u00a0have need Mike Pence to cast a vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett.\u00a0You know,\u00a0there had never been a vote to confirm any executive branch\u00a0nomination. That was broken by\u00a0the\u00a0vice president until Betsy DeVos in\u00a0early 2017. Mike Pence has broken several other ties regarding executive\u00a0branch nominees since it had never happened\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court nominee,\u00a0but he is not even going to come just to preside over\u00a0the\u00a0vote. His vote\u00a0was not needed two years ago when\u00a0they confirmed Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0They did bring him in and he sat\u00a0there over\u00a0the\u00a0vote and announced\u00a0the\u00a0vote\u00a0total, but don't forget that he has had several aides test positive for\u00a0coronavirus and\u00a0there has been concern expressed certainly by Democrats\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0safety protocols.\u00a0They wrote a letter, Democratic leaders in\u00a0the\u00a0Senate, to Mike Pence,\u00a0discouraging him from coming. Saying look, we are worried about doing this\u00a0with\u00a0safety and health protocols anyway and we are really concerned if you\u00a0are going to come up here so he's not going to come to Capitol Hill.\u00a0They\u00a0will vote here soon.\u00a0So again, we are waiting for Mitch McConnell to wrap up and as I said last\u00a0time, you know, timing and\u00a0the\u00a0Senate, it never works out just\u00a0the\u00a0way you\u00a0think. So, we are thinking now, you know, we are pushing 8 o'clock.\u00a0They\u00a0might not actually start this confirmation vote until sometime after 9\u00a0o'clock, at 8 o'clock, and at\u00a0the\u00a0latest\u00a0they would probably close to vote\u00a0before 9.\u00a0Now keep in mind that we are only expecting one Republican no, Susan\u00a0Collins of Maine, so probably 52 Republican yes' and when\u00a0they get across\u00a0that vote threshold, 51 votes, when\u00a0they are at 51 ayes, we can say that\u00a0they have basically --\u00a0they have\u00a0the\u00a0votes to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as\u00a0the\u00a0115th justice of\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court, but\u00a0the\u00a0vote is never final until\u00a0they actually close\u00a0the\u00a0vote.\u00a0Also, on hand today, she was not here yesterday, you have Senator Kamala\u00a0Harris,\u00a0the\u00a0Democratic vice-presidential nominee. She was not here for\u00a0the\u00a0procedural vote yesterday. She is here and she will cast a vote against Amy\u00a0Coney Barrett -- Amy Coney Barrett later tonight,\u00a0Martha.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Chad, thank you very much. We know that Kamala Harris has said\u00a0many times that she thinks this process is illegitimate and I'm sure she\u00a0wants to be\u00a0there to cast her no vote. I also would venture a guess that if\u00a0this was coming down to\u00a0the\u00a0wire that\u00a0the\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence would\u00a0find some way to get in\u00a0there to place that vote.\u00a0Ron Johnson said he would go in in a moon suit if needed be -- if need be\u00a0when he had\u00a0the\u00a0virus a week or so ago. I don't know, time is -- time just\u00a0seems to be going so fast.\u00a0Bret Baier and Shannon Bream back\u00a0with\u00a0us now. Bret, you heard Chad\u00a0speaking by\u00a0the\u00a0fact that Susan Collins is expected to be\u00a0the\u00a0only no vote\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Republican side. She has distinguished herself in that way\u00a0throughout\u00a0these Supreme Court procedures\u00a0with\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh, she was\u00a0the\u00a0one on\u00a0the\u00a0fence. She's in a tough Senate race right now.\u00a0BAIER:\u00a0 Very tough. Trying to hang on to her political life in Maine --MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes.BAIER:\u00a0 -- and trailing in\u00a0the\u00a0latest polls\u00a0there. This is a tough spot for\u00a0her, but she is doing what was expected that she would do. It's interesting\u00a0that, you know,\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats are\u00a0there in person. Obviously,\u00a0they\u00a0boycotted\u00a0the\u00a0Senate judiciary committee hearing\u00a0with\u00a0no votes against\u00a0Judge Barrett, but because\u00a0there's only one Republican vote against her\u00a0suggests how well she did in that confirmation hearing.\u00a0Her, you know, credentials, her ability to answer questions\u00a0straightforwardly, to talk about what originalism is, to be a qualified\u00a0judge or justice seemed to convince even those that were on\u00a0the\u00a0fence. Mitt\u00a0Romney talked a lot in his speech today about how qualified she was, as did\u00a0Lisa Murkowski.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. Mitt Romney obviously was one of those\u00a0the\u00a0people on\u00a0the\u00a0Republican side of\u00a0the\u00a0fence were concerned about. He's a yes. Lisa\u00a0Murkowski also a yes against\u00a0the\u00a0process, but for\u00a0the\u00a0person essentially.\u00a0Shannon, Justice Thomas is going to swear her in. Tell us a little bit\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0significance of that moment and who is chosen for that moment and\u00a0also, if I could ask two questions at once here, a little bit about\u00a0the\u00a0clerks and how that gets set up during that process for her.\u00a0BREAM:\u00a0 Yes. Certainly,\u00a0there are, as I mentioned earlier,\u00a0there are two\u00a0different swearing ins.\u00a0There is a constitutional oath, a judicial oath, so\u00a0very meaningful for her I'm sure that she has Justice Thomas\u00a0there. As I\u00a0mentioned earlier, she clerked for Justice Scalia.\u00a0They were very close\u00a0friends. Often in alignment on judicial philosophy and on critical\u00a0decisions, so it's very plausible that she would have had a relationship\u00a0with\u00a0Justice Thomas while she was clerking for Justice Scalia.\u00a0So, for him to be\u00a0there tonight for her big moment is certainly a statement\u00a0and a welcome to her from somebody who was exceptionally close to\u00a0the\u00a0man\u00a0she calls a mentor and a guiding force in her judicial philosophy, which\u00a0was Justice Scalia.\u00a0So, you look forward to where\u00a0they will go next. Many of\u00a0these judges, when\u00a0they're getting prepared to go to\u00a0the\u00a0circuit level or here now to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court will have some clerks in place. Usually\u00a0they dip back into\u00a0the\u00a0clerk pool of people that have served\u00a0with\u00a0them before as clerks. She's\u00a0had, you know, two or three years now on\u00a0the\u00a0seventh circuit. It's very\u00a0likely that she has talked\u00a0with\u00a0some of those clerks about, listen, if I am\u00a0confirmed to\u00a0the\u00a0court tonight, we are going to have to hit\u00a0the\u00a0ground\u00a0running.\u00a0So, she probably -- you can have up to four clerks\u00a0there on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court. She probably has made some arrangements, had some conversations, you\u00a0know, you don't want to get ahead of yourself but she is going to jump\u00a0right into\u00a0the\u00a0workload\u00a0the\u00a0minute that she is confirmed and sworn in, so\u00a0it is very smart. It's not really like measuring\u00a0the\u00a0drapes ahead of time.\u00a0You do have to have your clerks ready because she will jump into a term\u00a0that started a month ago and\u00a0there's a lot of work to do. And as I said\u00a0earlier, a lot of\u00a0these emergency appeals that are coming in on ballot\u00a0measures and mail-in ballots and all kinds of things, so\u00a0they are merely\u00a0every day for\u00a0the\u00a0last few weeks we'd seen some type of emergency filing,\u00a0so she's going to have that to jump into as well as\u00a0the\u00a0cases that\u00a0they're\u00a0going to start hearing in\u00a0their next round of arguments on Monday.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Just more -- she's got a busy life and it's going to get even\u00a0busier.\u00a0Let's bring in Jonathan Turley. Joining me once again now, George\u00a0Washington law professor and Fox News contributor. You know,\u00a0with\u00a0regard to\u00a0what Shannon just spoke about, some of\u00a0these voting issues that are before\u00a0the\u00a0court,\u00a0there has been some discussion about her appointment by\u00a0President Trump and\u00a0the\u00a0election going on and whether or not she should\u00a0have to recuse herself and I heard you speak about this this afternoon as\u00a0an insult and I'd love for you to explain to everybody at home why you see\u00a0it that way.\u00a0TURLEY:\u00a0 It's utterly absurd, what is being suggested by some of\u00a0these\u00a0members.\u00a0There is no basis why she should recuse herself from voting on\u00a0these pending cases or on election cases.\u00a0There is a standard for recusal\u00a0that is codified. Some justices have recused\u00a0themselves, relatively few\u00a0cases.\u00a0It's a matter left largely after\u00a0the\u00a0justices\u00a0themselves.\u00a0They are not\u00a0subject to\u00a0the\u00a0decision,\u00a0the\u00a0review of lower court judges, so this is left\u00a0to\u00a0their discretion. When\u00a0they have recused\u00a0themselves, it is because\u00a0they've had a personal interest, financial or professional, on a case.\u00a0Justice Kagan recused herself because she was involved in some of\u00a0the\u00a0cases\u00a0that came before\u00a0the\u00a0court.\u00a0There is no case in\u00a0the\u00a0history of\u00a0the\u00a0court\u00a0that would support a demand for recusal from his election cases.\u00a0Moreover, if we are going to make another decision like Bush v. Gore, we\u00a0don't want to be based on a tie. We want a full panoply of justices to\u00a0decide. To suggest that she should recuse herself has got to be some kind\u00a0of judicial shale, and she's not. She's a very serious intellectual and\u00a0jurist.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You know, by that measure, it would seem to me that anyone who\u00a0was appointed by any president, if any decision came before\u00a0them that might\u00a0benefit\u00a0them in some way,\u00a0they would have to recuse\u00a0themselves. I mean, it\u00a0makes no sense.\u00a0TURLEY:\u00a0 That's right. And you know --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:\u00a0 We are listening in,\u00a0the\u00a0vote is underway. Jonathan, stand by\u00a0with\u00a0me.

And 52 votes for Amy Coney Barrett to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court.\u00a0Shannon Bream, your thoughts on some of\u00a0the\u00a0political showmanship here\u00a0with\u00a0some, you know, vote and walk out essentially by all\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats?\u00a0BREAM:\u00a0\u00a0There has been a lot of drama around this particular nomination,\u00a0confirmation process. It is something that's a lifetime appointment. It is\u00a0critically important to both sides. And so not surprisingly we would have a\u00a0little bit of drama tonight.\u00a0We talked a little bit earlier about Senator Collins, Republican running\u00a0for reelection in Maine voting no. I have to think that\u00a0there was an\u00a0understanding\u00a0with\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP\u00a0leadership that she would vote no because\u00a0they knew\u00a0they were covered\u00a0otherwise. She's in a tough race. That no vote may actually help her\u00a0there.\u00a0And\u00a0there's a lot of conversation about whether\u00a0the\u00a0swiftness of this\u00a0confirmation may cost\u00a0the\u00a0GOP and those Senate races in\u00a0the\u00a0fall. So, I got\u00a0to think\u00a0there was a deal in place for her to vote no because\u00a0they felt\u00a0they have\u00a0the\u00a0other boats to go forward.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. Shannon, thank you. Also joining me Mike Davis. Former law\u00a0clerk to Justice Neil Gorsuch who now works to confirm President Trump's\u00a0judicial nominees as\u00a0the\u00a0Article III Project. Mike, your thoughts as this\u00a0vote has now passed for Amy Coney Barrett.\u00a0MIKE DAVIS, FORMER LAW CLERK TO JUSTICE GORSUCH:\u00a0 This is a historic\u00a0victory for President Trump.\u00a0Then candidate Donald Trump in 2016 campaigned\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0promise that he would transform\u00a0the\u00a0federal judiciary\u00a0with\u00a0judges\u00a0who understood that\u00a0there are modest but critical role is to follow\u00a0the\u00a0law\u00a0and President Trump has done that\u00a0with\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, justice Kavanaugh.\u00a0A near old time record 53 judges to\u00a0the\u00a0critically important federal\u00a0important federal courts of appeals. And now Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 You know, your thoughts on Amy Coney Barrett and what kind of\u00a0justice she will be.\u00a0DAVIS:\u00a0 She is a phenomenal Supreme Court justice. We saw this during her\u00a0hearing. She's exceptionally well-qualified. She's going to bring a very\u00a0unique perspective to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court, as a mother of seven kids, two\u00a0adopted from Haiti. One\u00a0with\u00a0down syndrome. She is number one in her class\u00a0at Notre Dame Law School. Clerked on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court for Justice Scalia.\u00a0She's going to bring a nine Ivy League perspective to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0which is desperately needed.\u00a0MACCALLUM:\u00a0 She says she's going to teach\u00a0them something about football.\u00a0And we know that it's very collegial on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court so we expect that\u00a0will happen. Thank you, Mike. Good to see you tonight.That is\u00a0THE\u00a0STORY\u00a0of Monday, October 26, 2020. But as always,\u00a0THE\u00a0STORY\u00a0continues.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We do have a busy night for you folks. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is THE STORY. As we sit 20 days before this presidential election of 2020, President Trump has been crossing the country this week. In moments, he will touch down in Iowa. And we are told by our own reporter John Roberts that the president on the plane has been reworking a huge chunk of his speech tonight. He will be as you might expect focusing on this news story, a bombshell report published by The New York Post reported by them earlier today. So that report reveals alleged emails between Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and a Ukrainian businessman that discussed a meeting with the former vice president. The Biden campaign pushing back on this report tonight. Otherwise though they were not on the campaign trail throughout the course of today. We're going to have much more on this story, including the president's speech as soon as he takes the stage there in Des Moines, Iowa tonight, so we can hear his response. It'll be the first time he's really reacting to any of this. So, stay tuned for that newsworthy event in just a little while. So, tomorrow, both Joe Biden and the president will have town halls on the night that was supposed to be the second presidential debate. So that leaves just one more matchup between these two individuals and that will be next week in Nashville, Tennessee. So, let's swing our attention for a moment here back to Capitol Hill today. Judge Amy Coney Barrett now done with the question and answer, two very long days throughout which she was very composed and answered those questions in a very solid manner. I think both sides would say over the course of this process, we're going to kick off with an observation that was made at the beginning of today by the chairman of the committee Senator Lindsey Graham. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): This hearing to me is an opportunity to not punch through a glass ceiling, but a reinforced concrete barrier around conservative women, you're going to shatter that barrier. And this is history being made folks. This is the first time in American history that we've nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology. And she's going to the court. Seat at the table is waiting on you. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Lindsey Graham says she is going to the court. The vote has not happened yet, as you know and is expected to wrap up at the end of the month. So, the talk will shift to how the court will change in this new composition. Barrett's approval rating did tick higher, as Americans watched her over the course of the last two days. Senator Durbin bookended Lindsey Graham's comments about making history, but his take on how that history was being made went this way. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): You're making history. You were the first nominee for a vacancy on the Supreme Court to be considered after July 1st of the election year. In fact, you're the first nominee to ever be considered in the midst of an election. There is a political agenda here. And whether you are privy to it, part of it, notwithstanding it has to do with the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, that is the cloud. The orange cloud over your nomination (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That from Senator Durbin. Joining me now is Chairman Chuck Grassley. He sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And of course, he was the chair of that committee during previous nominations for Kavanaugh and Gorsuch now justices, and he joins us now. Senator Grassley, thank you. It's always good to have you with us on the program. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): Thank you. MACCALLUM: I'd like to start if I may because we saw Senator Durbin suggesting that she might be privy to some plan to change the Obamacare ACA as it is known. And here she is expressing her complete independence as a judge. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY CONEY BARRETT, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I hope that you aren't suggesting that I don't have my own mind or that I couldn't think independently or that I would just decide like, let me see what Justice Scalia has said about this in the past because I assure you I have my own mind. But everything that he said is not necessarily what I would agree with or what I would do if I were Justice Barrett. That was Justice Scalia. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, I think the Justice Kavanaugh hearings a scarred a lot of people's memories. And you were right in the center of that, it was really raucous from the very beginning. Everybody remembers Kamala Harris jumped in, I think within seconds of you gaveling down to start opposing even the proceedings going forward. How do you feel about how this process has reflected on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator? GRASSLEY: Well, for everybody on the committee, the fact that it was more peaceful than Kavanaugh, I think it's going to really satisfy people from that standpoint. I think from the standpoint of people not being able to find, particularly Democrats on the committee, not being able to find any fault wrong with her qualifications because they're impeccable. They tried to make a pretty much a political campaign out of this, reflecting things that they think will help them between now and November the 3rd. But overall, I think that this is much better a public image of this committee in this process than Kavanaugh was. And without a doubt, the difference between night and day. MACCALLUM: So, as we all remember, when you look back at the beginning of the Kavanaugh process was very smooth and the overall impression was that he was going to be approved without any major speed bumps. And the speed bumps came after the part that we all just finished in this process. Do you have any indication because the vote isn't until the end of the month that Democrats are sitting on any information that they have anything up their sleeve? Or do you think it goes smoothly this time all the way through? GRASSLEY: The only - I can't really answer your question except referring back to what Senator Schumer said over the weekend, that they might not even show up to make a quorum on the day that we vote on this. And if he would go through with that, then things would be different. But you're absolutely right. Everything up until about the first week of September on Kavanaugh was very peaceful. And then just soon as they couldn't get - lay a hand on him, they came up with all the things with Dr. Ford, et cetera, et cetera. And we haven't seen any of that this time, but we aren't going to know until tomorrow. MACCALLUM: Do you anticipate that politically they would assess that not producing enough senators for the quorum and the full Senate vote would be advantageous to them? GRASSLEY: I think everybody goes to work for their job. We get paid about $175,000 a year. They expect us to work. I have - I've got the best record of any senator in the 240 years history of our country of not missing a vote. I'm going to be there. I think every senator should be there. I think the taxpayers expect and be there. But for reasons that they might think that they would at least satisfy their very progressive base, which if you look at their Twitter, some of that progressive base isn't very happy with the way Feinstein and other people in the Senate handled this. In other words, they weren't tough enough. You don't know what they might do to satisfy their progressive base. MACCALLUM: In fact, Dianne Feinstein really complimented her on her explanation of severability. She said, wow, that was pretty great. It was a very honest, I think, answer in the moment. This is Kamala Harris, who was, I believe, just down the hall in her office. You know, and after I play this, I'd like to hear about why you believe she was there instead on the floor, which was basically empty by that point. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I just want to understand, are you saying that you refuse to dispute a known fact or that you refuse to agree with a known fact? BARRETT: Senator, I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at with asking me to endorse the fact or whether any particular practice constitutes voter discrimination. I'm very happy to say that I think racial discrimination still exists in the United States, and I think we've seen evidence of that this summer. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What was your thought on that exchange, sir? GRASSLEY: Well, first of all, I think she would look better if she had been in the committee room with us. Secondly, the reason she wasn't there, I'm told, is because of protection from the virus, which is legitimate. But I also heard that some people are getting in the elevator with a massive number of people. So, I don't know whether the distancing was a very important factor. There was some other reason, she wasn't there. MACCALLUM: Interesting. All right. Speaking of Twitter, this story that came out, The New York Post reported that they got their hands-on emails between Hunter Biden and a Ukrainian businessman that don't look very good. The first one that came out was from April 17th, 2015, and it says Dear Hunter, and this is from Vadim Pozharskyi, an adviser to Verismo. He says, Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together. It's really an honor and a pleasure. And then a previous email that sets this up is back in May of 2014 asking Hunter for advice on how you could use your influence on our company's behalf. Now, Twitter restricted this story. They shut down the story in some way, shape or form. And even people's accounts who were tweeting this story got a block on them. And now, Senate Republicans have put out a response to Jack Dorsey of Twitter. And there's a look at that showing the block of this story on Twitter and saying, see you soon, Jack, referring to the chairman and founder of Twitter. What do you think about all that, sir? GRASSLEY: Well, this this censorship by these platforms is a bigger thing, but this is a perfect example of where there's some evidence of things that I and my investigation and Johnson's investigation has been suspicious of, for a long time and it kind of backs up our suspicion. All I personally know about it is what I read in the post, but it does give some credence to things we believe for a long time, like we know for instance, money from the mayor's wife of Moscow paying some millions of dollars to some firm connected with Hunter Biden. I don't want to say for sure that we've got absolute proof that this is going on, but it sure goes down the same direction that we had been suspicious of for a long period of time. Well, I have not received this material. Senator Johnson has received it. And I'm going to wait until Senator Johnson gets some review of it. MACCALLUM: All right. Fair enough. We will speak, I believe we're going to speak to Rudy Giuliani tomorrow about this, and we will be speaking with him tomorrow night. And we'll reach out to Senator Johnson as well to get the facts. And we do hope that there will be questions asked about it obviously, at this town hall, tomorrow night would be the first opportunity to ask the former vice president about it. So, Senator Grassley, thank you very much, sir. Always good to see you. GRASSLEY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here. GRASSLEY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, we do expect President Trump is going to take the stage, a big crowd in Des Moines, Iowa this evening. We're told that he has reworked a large portion of his speech tonight and he's going to focus it on this New York Post story, which is now also become a story about Facebook and Twitter, who don't want you to see this story because they say that it's not substantiated. So that back and forth is also a big part of this. We will take you there when that gets underway. And also, one of the biggest unanswered questions raised by this New York Post story is the man who turned over these emails which were on a laptop. Where did he get them? That man speaks out to our own reporter at Fox News after this. Stay with us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who specifically are we talking about when you say you're fearful? JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC, OWNER OF COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP: I mean, you read the article, there is compromising material on the drive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, the Biden's? You're afraid of? ISAAC: That's, that's the fear. Sure. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So, The New York Post dropped a bombshell report today. The reporting lays out purported emails between Hunter Biden and Ukrainian businessmen. In the emails, they're discussing with then a meeting with the then Vice President Joe Biden and how Hunter could use his influence in those business dealings. Now, the Post reports that the emails came from a laptop that was dropped off at a computer repair shop in Delaware back in April of 2019. And now the focus has turned to the owner of that shop and his connection to Rudy Giuliani, who ended up with one of the hard drives. So, correspondent Jacqui Heinrich spoke with the owner of this computer shop today and she joins us with that report from Wilmington. Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. Well, the owner of this shop is legally blind. He uses a monocle to repair computers from a working distance of about eight inches. So, he cannot confirm that it was Hunter Biden who, in fact, dropped off the laptop here, he says, back in April. But he says while he was in the process of transferring data from that computer, he found some disturbing items, including pornography. By June and July, impeachment was in the headlines. And after 90 days passed and Hunter Biden still had not paid for or picked up his laptop. The owner, John Paul Isaac, who is a registered Republican keywords, searched through the emails and found what appeared to be an email from Burisma board member asking Hunter Biden for advice on how he could use his influence on the company's behalf. Another purported email asks Hunter to set up a meeting with Vice President Biden. Isaac said with the impeachment ongoing, he used an intermediary to inform the FBI who took the computer. He says he saw no substantial follow- up. So, the intermediary reached out to three lawmakers who he says also did nothing. Later, they went to politicians, including Rudy Giuliani's lawyer. He says this intermediary is an American citizen and a longtime friend. And in light of Burisma being hacked by the Russians and concerns those emails could have been planted, Isaac said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there any thought in your mind that this could not - that this might not have been Hunter's, that might have been somebody trying to set Hunter up? ISAAC: No. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: Isaac believes the FBI covered up the investigation, claiming at one point they said nothing happens to people who don't talk. He was frustrated by the impeachment over President Trump's alleged efforts to discover such information as he had in his shop and said he was in fear of his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISAAC: There's a lot of players in this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Ukrainians? Is that who you're talking about? ISAAC: I mean, don't put that in there. The guy's got a hit squad. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's who you're afraid of, you're afraid of the Ukrainians? ISAAC: I'm afraid of somebody wanting to not make sure that I don't extort them for money or that I don't do, you know, things with the computer. They would silence people, too. So, I was afraid for the owner. I was afraid for the people that are involved, the contents of it. And I just wanted it out of my shop. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, you're afraid for Hunter Biden? Not of the Biden family. ISAAC: No. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEINRICH: And the owner clearly stated that he took action because he was frustrated by the impeachment. But he says it wasn't about getting people to vote one way or another, Martha. MACCALLUM: Very interesting. Jacqui, thank you very much. Jacqui Heinrich. So, here now, Deroy Murdock, contributing editor for National Review Online, and Katie Pavlich, news editor and Richard Fowler, Senior Fellow at the New Leaders Council. All are Fox News Contributors. Deroy, let me start with you. What's your reaction to Jacqui's story and to the New York Post story? DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Amazing. The whole thing sounds like a spy novel with this gentleman who only can see eight inches in front of him and dropped off laptops, all this other stuff. I think this really goes to the questions that we heard during the whole Ukraine great situation. That Hunter Biden was often his own thing. He never - I think Vice President Biden said he never talked with his son about his business dealings. And this is all his own son's separate world. And now we learn that his son is bringing this Ukrainian businessman to meet with none other than Vice President Biden. So, it seems like there's that connection. And I think the most mysterious thing about this is this trip to Moscow that Hunter Biden took. I was in Moscow some years ago. I came home with some matryoshka dolls and some postcards. Hunter Biden came home with $3.5 million from not just from some investment, but from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. I'd like to get more information on that. That sounds like Russian collusion to me and certainly a very unusual situation to go to Moscow and come back with $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Very unusual. We need to know a lot more about that. MACCALLUM: So, I want to go to Richard, but let's pull up these emails that were printed in The New York Post today that are purported to be between Hunter Biden and a Burisma adviser named Vadim Pozharskyi. I'm probably mispronouncing his name. So, this was the first one. This is May 12th, 2014. And this is from the Burisma adviser to Hunter Biden. We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence to convey a message, signal, et cetera, to stop what we consider to be politically motivated actions, he writes. And remember, he was making $50,000 a month to be an adviser to Burisma with no former experience in the energy industry business. So, then let's go forward a year to April 17th, 2015. And this is another email to Hunter Biden, purportedly from this Burisma adviser, Pozharskyi saying that it was nice to meet Biden's father. He says, Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together. It's really an honor and a pleasure. So, let me - now I also want to point out the Biden campaign response to this. The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of the story. They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani, who's discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported, claim to have such materials. Moreover, we have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting has alleged by The New York Post ever took place. Richard, your thoughts? RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, thanks for having me, Martha. A couple of points on this, I think this is just another attempt by Senator Ron Johnson, who two weeks ago, his committee came out with a 70 some odd page report indicating that both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden had no wrongdoing here. So, let's be very clear. Did Hunter Biden make some mistakes in his career? Absolutely. Are those mistakes worthy of another Homeland Security Senate investigation? Absolutely not. Ron Johnson should be more concerned about ensuring that the American people are kept safe during this global pandemic in which 36 states are seeing an uptick in COVID cases, instead of this witch hunt of a story, as the president would call it, because that's what it is here. There's misinformation. The chain of custody of this particular hard drive seems to be a little bit murky. And once again, I think this is just a Hail Mary by Republicans who are losing. The president's having a rally tonight in Iowa. You know why? He won that state handily in 2016, but now he's behind. MACCALLUM: Yes, he won Iowa by 10 points, that's a valid point, and it looks like it's neck and neck right now. Just on that Twitter story, because this is the other element here. And Katie, I just want you to weigh in on everything, but they've also locked down Kayleigh McEnany's account at the moment because she also tweeted this story out, which is just extraordinary, the coordination between these social media companies that have decided that this thing is so hot and that they have to make sure that they block it. Katie, decent questions raised about the validity of this story, but what's your take? KATIE PAVLICH , EDITOR: Sure. Well, the bottom line is that questions about Hunter Biden's Burisma ties and whether Joe Biden was involved and he repeatedly says that he knew nothing about his son's foreign business dealings, his investments, especially when he was overseeing the Ukrainian profile and portfolio for the Obama administration. Now, if these emails turn out to be valid, well, that was a lie. And the issue is what people are saying, you're going after Hunter Biden. It's a distraction. This is about Joe Biden. This is about Washington, D.C. politicians selling out the American taxpayer and using their government position to gain financial or other benefits for their own family members. That is what this is about. And the question is for Hunter Biden, did he register as a foreign agent, as a number of people have been required to do? Why is it that he was allegedly taking members of the Burisma board, who by the way, witnesses during the impeachment trial said there was a major conflict of interest and questions from the State Department about the conflict of interest because Burisma was so corrupt. Did that meeting take place? And the Biden campaign's response to say, well, it wasn't on the official calendar is not really a denial that it happened. And the bottom line is that today Joe Biden called let around 10:30 AM, because he doesn't want to answer questions about this topic and he should answer questions because it's about the American people being sold out in favor of Hunter Biden's $83,000 a year or a month rather, from a very corrupt entity while the vice president is now running for president. What would he do in the Oval Office when it comes to corrupt companies like Burisma that his son may be on the board of? MACCALLUM: It's a good question, and I certainly hope that he gets asked that question at the town hall tomorrow night, because there are answers to these questions Deroy. One is a question that Hunter Biden could definitely answer. Did you drop off your laptop at this place? And did you have emails between you and this individual on that laptop? That is a question that he should definitely know the answer to. And one of the issues that comes up here, Deroy, is the lack of hard questions that Joe Biden has faced. And he hasn't because of COVID-19, he hasn't faced that many questions at all over the course of the last several months. MURDOCK: No, that's absolutely right, and one question I'd ask is, Mr. Vice President, what did you know and when did you know it? And ask him very specifically, what did he know about his son's dealings with these people? Did they, in fact, have a meeting in the White House or elsewhere where this Ukrainian businessman who apparently sent a thank you note for that meeting, did they in fact, meet together with the vice president? Another question I'd ask is, I believe this came out a bit during the impeachment hearings back late last year, I believe it was George Kent of the State Department said that there was some effort to meet with the vice president's staff regarding Hunter Biden, who they believed was a distraction and an embarrassment, and it was hindering American diplomacy in Ukraine, in Eastern Europe. Did that get up to the vice president's attention? Did he learn about this? If he did, did he do anything about it? If he didn't hear anything about it, that may say something about his management of his own office. And if he had heard about it and didn't, it was not forthcoming with the American public, then he's dishonest. If it never got to him because his staff was not sharing the sort of thing then perhaps, he's incompetent. So, either one is not very encouraging for a man who is running for President of the United Status. MACCALLUM: I think about the Amy Coney Barrett hearing today and her talking about the fact that no one is above the law and that the rule of law has to apply equally. And I think about General Michael Flynn. I think about others who were caught up in the Russian collusion scandal and that turned out to be to go nowhere, according to Mueller report, after two years of investigation. But registering yourself as a foreign agent, doing work in a foreign country is one of the things that they were charged with and went to jail for, Richard. So, is that a question that you would, given that situation, that it is quite fair to ask and press Hunter Biden on at this point? FOWLER: Look, I think we all had troubled family members. And what you have here is Hunter Biden, who seems to be a troubled member of the Biden family. But remember, just two weeks ago, like I said earlier, there was a Senate report that investigated all of these things, that asked all those questions, that got all those answers. And when that report came out, almost 80 pages of it which I had the chance to read, it shows that there is no wrongdoing by either Vice President Biden or Hunter Biden. That's where the story should begin, and that should be where the story should end. These e-mails were probably already asked and answered. And not to mention the fact that the chain of custody on those e-mails are problematic. Why didn't the shop director call the FBI? MACCALLUM:\u00a0 He did. FOWLER:\u00a0 Or why didn't he call the FBI directly. Why he didn't get to Rudy Giuliani? Why didn't Rudy Giuliani had it before the -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 He did. He extended to -- no, he said he went -- well his story, and I -- you know, I'm with you. I mean, there's -- there is a lot of digging that needs to happen on this, and I do hope that Vice President Biden at least during a portion of tomorrow night is going to be asked to some of these questions because they are very valid questions than he has said in the past that he had no knowledge of these things. So, at the very least, he must be pressed on the knowledge that he had and whether or not his memory has changed on any of this. But that is -- that is completely fair game in the questions for the vice president. And he has, you know, really gotten off it very lightly on all of this. Here comes the president down the staircase. Katie, your thoughts -- your thoughts on this before we -- KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Well, to say that these questions about Hunter Biden's behavior and the connection to Joe Biden when he was vice president that they all have been asked and answered is completely dishonest. Hunter Biden hasn't testified in front on any committee about this issue, he hasn't talked to the FBI about this. There are still a number of questions that have never been asked. And this were to happen to any former vice president who is -- (CROSSTALK) FOWLER:\u00a0 Well, Katie, there was an 80-page report. PAVLICH:\u00a0 Excuse me, Richard, do not talk to me -- talk over me. I am speaking, I didn't interrupt you. If this were a Republican vice president -- (CROSSTALK) FOWLER:\u00a0 I'm just saying there was an 80-page report that you're not acknowledging. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Hold on. Don't talk over each other. PAVLICH:\u00a0 If this were a former -- if this were a former vice president who happened to be a Republican, there would be another special counsel investigation launched to get to the bottom of what happened. And the bottom line, too, Martha, you asked earlier about Twitter and Facebook censoring this type of information, the idea of the double standard of their promoting a number of Russia conspiracy theories for years that ended up not being true shows that there is a double standard, that they are a publisher not a platform as they continue to claim. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. Richard, quickly what were -- what were you trying to say? FOWLER:\u00a0 I'm just saying that there no -- there's been no acknowledgment of this 80-page report that was produced by Ron Johnson as the committee of the chair. PAVLICH:\u00a0 When did Hunter testified? FOWLER:\u00a0 So the fact that now he is -- it doesn't -- the report who had Senate investigators it was produced and signed by Ron Johnson, so for him now to go back and say, I want to look at more information seems to be incredible to me especially when the chain of custody of this data -- (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH:\u00a0 It was an initial report -- MACCALLUM:\u00a0 OK. FOWLER:\u00a0 -- that are being in question. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Katie, hold on. All right. Deroy, you know, with regard to Twitter and Facebook and Katie's point about this, it feels just wrong. I mean, I know that some members of the Senate, Senate Republicans have said that they want Jack Dorsey to explain what's going on over there. But to put a block on the story which was printed in the New York Post this morning, anybody can get their hands on it, and their fact-checkers are making a judgment on freezing these accounts that are passing along the story which, you know, you can bring issue with it and Twitter is full of both sides of the story, as it should be. DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 The American people should be allowed to look at the story, judge it a pro or con as they wish. And it's yet another example of these companies that are behaving this way and basically censoring things -- MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. MURDOCK:\u00a0 -- while at the same time enjoying the protection of the Communications Decency Act section 230. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. MURDOCK:\u00a0 So basically, they can protect themselves from lawsuits. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 I want -- MURDOCK:\u00a0 They behave like this. They should lose that protection. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. I want to squeeze in very quickly while we're waiting for the president to come up here. This moment with Nancy Pelosi and Wolf Blitzer yesterday, because, Richard, I know you wanted to talk about the COVID stimulus bill -- this moment got a lot of attention. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:\u00a0 I don't know why you are always an apologist and many of your colleagues, apologists for the Republican position. You really don't know what you're talking about. WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN:\u00a0 It's not about me, it's about millions of Americans who can't put food on the table, who can't pay the rent and -- (CROSSTALK) PELOSI:\u00a0 And we represent them. BLITZER:\u00a0 We're having trouble -- PELOSI:\u00a0 And we represent them. BLITZER:\u00a0 Who are troubled getting by -- PELOSI:\u00a0 And we represent them. BLITZER:\u00a0 -- these long food lines that we see PELOSI:\u00a0 We know them. BLITZER:\u00a0 I know you are. I am sensitive to them because I see them on the street begging for food, begging for money. Now Speaker, thank you so much. PELOSI:\u00a0 Have you fed them? We feed them. We feed them. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 She feeds them, Richard. You know, this -- the White House is at, I believe 1.9 trillion, she is at 2.2 trillion. So, you've got at least 1.8 trillion, 1.9 trillion that is agreed upon. So why not get it out there? FOWLER:\u00a0 Look, I want to deal just like the next person. And I think it's - - I think what you have to remember here is for Speaker Pelosi, she's had a deal in place since May. And since May, Republicans have dragged their feet while 30 million Americans were unemployed, they drag their feet while small businesses close their doors. They dragged their feet while school have been totally reopened and -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 There been already trillions of dollars that have gone out, Ricahrd. In fact, 500 billion of it hasn't even been spent yet. That's the first thing that Congress needs to do -- (CROSSTALK) FOWLER:\u00a0 Well, this is -- MACCALLUM:\u00a0 -- just authorize the spending on that money that's already there. FOWLER:\u00a0 Absolutely. Absolutely. But this goes back to administrative mismanagement. Remember, two weeks ago, Donald Trump called off negotiations altogether. The president's strategy on this has been terrible. And when it comes to Speaker Pelosi, since May she has had a bill in place and Republicans refused, they refused to take it up. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. We're going to dip in here. He's talking about this Hunter Biden situation. Let's see what the president is saying in Iowa, Des Moines, Iowa tonight. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\u00a0 -- his son's corrupt business dealing. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And this is a big smoking gun, the newly uncovered e-mails revealed that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it's an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month, but it's now looking like it could be $183,000 a month, that's a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I'll take it. We'll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience, knew nothing about energy -- wrote to Hunter arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I've been saying this for a long time with that family, the same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an e-mail saying, quote, \"we urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence.\" In other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his vice president father who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 How about the Russia hoax? It turns out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion. No collusion. These e-mails show that Biden's repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he's trying to cover up a massive pay- for-play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it. We've known it for a long time. The fact is, there was never an administration more corrupt than Obama- Biden administration. There was never. Never. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Just weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims have been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn't even be allowed to run for the presidency. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt mainstream media, right back there, all of those cameras right back there - - (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 They are corrupt. And they refused to write the story. There wasn't one time in almost four years during my presidency -- during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, a witch hunt, a horrible, horrible, disgusting witch hunt that should never, ever happen to another presidency again. And people should pay for the crimes they committed. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Which turns out to be a totally illegal hoax that false and libelous stories every day. False and libelous stories, and they knew they were false, too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by a Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media, never once. Yet, with Biden today they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They're trying to protect them. They are trying to protect Biden. They take him down. And I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us, Air Force One. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:\u00a0 And I had heard and I just don't know this for a fact, but they say Kayleigh McEnany -- you know Kayleigh, right? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Kayleigh McEnany. Good Kayleigh. She is so great. She is incredible. They close down her account. She is the White House press secretary. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Because she is reporting the truth. They close down her account. So, let's see what's going to happen. And did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Bruce Ohr, him and his wonderful wife Molly. She wrote all of this stuff and then he goes and he works the Department of Justice, and he took -- didn't he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes it, she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That's good, a couple of years too late that's all. He should be not only in the Department of Justice outbox. He should be someplace else. OK? Eight months after his alleged meeting with the Burisma executives. So, these Burisma, Burisma, they say pronounce it Burisma, a real beautiful company. Vice President Joe Biden went to the Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That's Burisma. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 The documents also show that before one of Joe's trips to Ukraine, Hunter e-mailed his business partner saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that. Should begin now. Right now. It's got to begin. It's -- the whole thing is so incredible. He's -- look, let's just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military, that's unfortunate. He didn't have a job for a long time. His father becomes vice president and he is making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No, think of it. Think of it. It's like the Hillary stuff, the crooked Hillary, and it's the crooked Joe. You know when a Democrat voted here in Iowa, asked Joe last year, you remember his son raked in money in exchange for providing access. Joe called that man a damn liar. You're a damn liar. The kid is making millions of dollars. He had nothing. He didn't have a job. Thrown out of the military, sadly, but thrown out of the military. And he knew nothing about energy, he knew nothing about investments, knew nothing about China. How about he walked away a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. They don't do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street. Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America an apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. OK? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Joe Biden must immediately release all e-mails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts and records related to his involvement to his family's business dealings. Influence patent around the worlds including China and including Russia. Including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China while Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs. They came -- you know where they came from, Iowa and plenty of other places, but they came from Iowa. He was giving them. They were taking our jobs, they were taking our factories, they were taking everything. They were taking her wealth. And I gave you $28 billion. You say, thank you very much, President Xi. It came right out of China. Because of that, everybody is happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 I hope you remember. Nobody else would've done it. Nobody else would have done it. The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact, the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia including Crimea. Remember Crimea? The Biden's got rich while America got robbed. By contrast, and this is so true and so easily true, and I'm so proud of it in so many ways. I have given up billions of dollars to serve as your president. It is my greatest honor of a lifetime. So true. (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHANTING) TRUMP:\u00a0 I ran for president because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people. And it's true. And by the way, before the China plague came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now it's going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401K ready? Because it's going through the roof. We are going to have the best year we've ever had. And we're going to have tax cuts not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 They want to increase your taxes so they can spend it on the Green New Deal. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 So, I know that beauty. I cannot sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry. And that's what it is. You know, you can say whatever you want, you can say whatever you want but when you have a kid that follows with his father -- and by the way take a look at his brother, his brother all of a sudden is building a big housing development in Iraq. Have you ever built a development before? No, I haven't. Take a look at the whole family, it's a corrupt family. Joe Biden personifies the selfless and corrupt globalist who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign. People assume that they'd be funding my campaign. I don't want them. We don't want them. We never needed them. We don't want them. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 But they betrayed American workers, disparage American values and crushed our middle-class. For decades, Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries, and countries that you've never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration, deadly drugs, MS-13 savages that assault, rape, and murder innocent Americans. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 They force our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spent trillions of dollars on never ending foreign wars. They just never end ended. But you know, we are bringing all our soldiers back home. You know that. We've been doing it for a long time. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And it's not easy. Not easy. The military industrial complex, not the easiest thing. But we are bringing them back home. We're almost finished in Afghanistan, coming in, we are dealing, we're down to a small number coming home by the end of the year, hopefully, by the end of the year, shortly thereafter. In Syria, we're out, totally out. And by the way, we crushed. Before I did this, we crushed 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 One hundred percent. We crushed a 100 percent. We have the greatest military in the world, and by the way, we have built the greatest military in the world. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 So, I just tell you from Iowa, you know, you are very powerful state politically, you're a big state to me, big in your heart. But you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you've never let me down. You just came in and we won by so much. You know, they say if a Republican win by one point, I think I won by 11, right? Eleven. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:\u00a0 That was early in the night, remember that? They said, Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa. Then they said, man, he won by 11 points, what's going on? That was just the beginning. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Then we won Ohio, we won Ohio by eight points. They said, what's going on? You know, that's one thing you want to say. But when you win by a lot -- and that was the beginning of something. And I'll tell you what, we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago. There really is. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And we have great poll numbers. Although, you know, you see a lot of the fake poll numbers. They're doing -- they'll do anything they can, they're called suppression polls. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes, there they go. Look. Look at the red lights, they start to go off as I start to point. You know, in one way they want the ratings, in another way, they don't want the ratings. And you're telling CNN that they are fraud and they're broadcasting. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 That was one of the greatest -- that was one of the greatest evenings ever. There were those who would say it was a most exciting evening in the history of television, highest rated evening in the history of television. And you know what? The election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important. It's actually more important. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:\u00a0 In 2016, you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your president, and I finally put America first. It's called make America great again. (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHANTING) TRUMP:\u00a0 It's windy out here. If you can wear the hat, I can wear the hat. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Should I take off the tie or not? What do you think? I don't know. Maybe, yes? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 That feels so much better. That feels better. That feels good. Now we can just relax and have a good time. No, but it's a -- it's great to be with you. Seriously, we've had a great history here together. What we've done for you and what we've done for the farmers and what we've done for everything. You know, two weeks ago, you have the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Right? (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country and the largest order of beef. But you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy. That's why. It was from China because they know what they've done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it. They didn't stop it. They should've stopped it. The only reason I'm your president is because the previous administration did a poor job. So poor in fact that I said, I'm going to run for president. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And you know what, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run. And if they did a good job, I guess I wouldn't have won. What you think. I wouldn't have run and I wouldn't have won. But they were so bad and it turns out they were so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved Washington swamp. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 You know, when I would say drain the swamp. I used to say it, you know, drain the swamp and people like it. I hated the expression. I hated it. I hated it. I said, this is a hokey expression. And I put it in one speech the place went crazy. I said, I'm starting to like that expression. Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy. I said, you know, I really like it. I really like it. But you know, when I say drain the swamp, I had no idea the swamp was that dirty, that disgusting and that deep. It's true. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. Thank God. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And I don't want to insult our great politicians, because you had some great ones with us tonight. But I don't always played by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment it's because I was elected to fight for you harder than -- and I'll tell you what. I fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for anyone. It's not easy. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 But I love it because we are making tremendous progress. We are making tremendous progress. And the fact is that no administration in their first three and a half years have ever done as much as this administration has done. You take a look at the list. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP:\u00a0 And you know, it's amazing because they always challenge you, they challenge you and everything. They never even challenged me on that statement. I make that statement all the time, they just stand and they think, they say he's right. We might hate him but they say he's right. Right now, I'm fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that's exactly what we're doing. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP:\u00a0 As a candidate, Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's domination. He handed control to the socialist and Marxists and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party. He is not running it. Let's face it. Joe is shot. Whether you like it or not, we can all be nice, it's going to be my turn someday, it's even going to be your turn someday, my friends, someday. But you know when it is your turn, you can't be president. One thing I've learned, President Xi of China he's a 100 percent. Putin of Russia, 100 percent. Kim Jong-un, by the way, whatever happened to that war we're supposed to have? Kim Jong-un of North Korea, 100 hundred percent. These people are sharp and they are smart. Joe has lost it. And his best day, he wasn't a smart man. Everybody knows that. But Joe is gone. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country, they are addicted to power. And God help us if they get it. We'll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover and we are -- MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. The president is touching a pretty heavily in the beginning part of the speech on this Hunter Biden, Joe Biden story that was reported by the New York Post today. And we have gone through those e-mails between the Ukrainian businessman and the origins of the e-mail or purportedly according to the New York Post from a laptop that was found in Wilmington, Delaware. So obviously there's a lot that needs to be dug into. On that story I want to be -- I want to bring back in our guest tonight. Our panel Deroy Murdock, contributing editor for National Review online, Katie Pavlich, news editor at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Townhall.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=66NL-BOo471AGSm_KnwRE_qfHEjM19jJhbDYidH1S1U&m=7g9wYo0tBbCvcoDL3Q6U5oS6m-G-CcUAChPq3gLmFlk&s=OVNf15OcffhctaAQa5GF3m-wLvXo4iiBBBOyoGssvS4&e= , and Richard Fowler, senior fellow at the New York -- at the New Leader's Council. All are Fox News contributors. I actually would like to start by playing by getting back to the meat of this race and playing a sound bite. Earlier this week, there was a very interesting poll from Gallup asking people are you better off now than you were four years ago. And 56 percent according to the Gallup poll said they were. And obviously, that's the argument that Trump is making out there in Iowa tonight. And then Joe Biden was asked about it, and here's what he said. Here's his response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 So why should people who feel that they are better off today under the Trump administration vote for you? JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 Well if they think that they probably shouldn't. They think 54 percent of the American people are better off economically today than they were on our administration. Well their memories are not very good quite frankly. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Richard, what do you think about that? FOWLER:\u00a0 Listen, I'm not sure if I would've answered the same way the vice president did. But I think this is just a -- it's just one poll. I think if you look across what's actually happening in the economy, you will see that there are many people that are suffering tonight. Right? There are many business owners that have had to close their doors and they might not reopen them again. There are many families that are trying to figure out how to make ends meet because mom or dad might be unemployed because they were a service worker they might not be returning to work. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. FOWLER:\u00a0 And while Donald Trump says he's trying to eradicate COVID-19, what you see here is a mass gathering where some people are wearing masks and some people aren't where nobody is socially distanced. And this is happening when there are 36 states that are moving in the wrong direction when it comes to this virus. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 All right. Katie, what do you say? PAVLICH:\u00a0 Well, this is going to be an election about whether people want to go back to an Obama-Biden presidency. Much of Joe Biden's platform has been about citing what he worked on with President Obama. Whether people want to go back to anemic GDP growth from quarter to quarter or the slowest economic recovery since World War II, or whether they want to go back to the beginning of the Trump administration and what the administration was able to do in the first three years in office. The president has used the line off and on the campaign trail that he has done more in his first term than Joe Biden did in 47 years in Washington, D.C. And so that's going to be the economic choice that people have moving forward. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Yes. PAVLICH:\u00a0 And for Joe Biden to stand in front of two vote signs and tell people not to vote for him doesn't -- really is a reflection of the enthusiasm that people have for his campaign. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Final thought, Deroy Murdock, on where this election stands with 20 days to go. MURDOCK:\u00a0 I think that the census bureau came up with some very interesting information a couple weeks ago, which is under President Trump and his policies we achieve the highest level of median national -- median household income and the lowest poverty level in U.S. history. All of that unfortunately was interrupted by the China virus. And now we are bouncing back. The economy is returning. And the question is, do we want to go back to the policies we have that made this country so effective and so prosperous before the coronavirus, or do we want to go to back to policies of Obama and Biden where we basically struggled around and barely move forward for eight years. I hope the American people vote for the policies that had us in excellent shape until COVID-19 arrived and created such total havoc. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Well, the polls are definitely not looking in the president's favor right now. Today, Politico talked about three races at the Cook Politico report moved a little bit further to the left in Alaska, in Texas, and in Georgia for the Senate races. So we will see where thing goes. It's going to be an intense 20 days. Thank you very much to all of you. Good to have you with us, Deroy, Katie, and Richard. (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH:\u00a0 Thanks, Martha. FOWLER:\u00a0 Good to see you, Martha. MACCALLUM:\u00a0 Always great to have you with us tonight. Thank you very much. So that is THE STORY of this Wednesday, October the 14th, 2020. THE STORY continues tomorrow night so I'll see you right back here tomorrow. We are going to dig in to this Biden story that we have been discussing. We've got Mayor Rudy Giuliani with us. We've got Senator Ron Johnson to answer some questions about his previous report. And we will see you back here tomorrow night. Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you then.

Three Black women in Arizona say they were racially profiled by a Cheesecake Factory manager after paying for their meal with a touchless QR code. On Saturday, Salisha Rigsbee,\u00a0Chelsey Richardson and Marquelle Blassingame\u00a0visited the cheesecake-centric chain in Peoria to celebrate Blassingame\u2019s birthday, The Arizona Republic reports. The women spent $52 on an appetizer and drinks\u00a0and paid the bill with a touchless QR code, a no-contact option that the restaurant adopted in May in the fight against COVID-19. Three Black women in Arizona say they were racially profiled by a Cheesecake Factory manager after paying for their meal with a touchless QR code. (iStock) Soon after, the women exited the restaurant and walked to Blassingame\u2019s car, when a man they identified as a restaurant manager allegedly followed them to the vehicle, and wrote down the license plate number. When the customers asked him what he was doing, the man said, \u201cI know what's going on here, it's not a problem. It's cool. I know what's going on here,\u201d and returned inside the restaurant. WAFFLE HOUSE INVESTIGATING WILD BRAWL THAT ALLEGEDLY BROKE OUT OVER UNPAID TICKETS AND CUSTOMER'S PHONE Richardson wrote on Twitter that the employee went back inside to call the police, and shared a screenshot of the mobile receipt for the meal. The women also returned into the Cheesecake Factory to ask what was happening and confirm that their payment was successful, even though the credit card had already been charged. According to the outlet, Rigsbee, Richardson and Blassingame spoke with a waitress and two other managers about what transpired, but were \u201cnot allowed\u201d to speak with the employee who jotted down the license plate information. \"You're not writing down a license plate number to send me a Christmas card. And you can't racially profile people and assume that because they use your system and paid via your QR code that they're automatically stealing,\u201d Rigsbee said she told a manager, per the outlet. Beyond an apology and a business card, the restaurant\u2019s general manager told the trio that he could \"not allow\" the other employee\u00a0\"to come out and\u00a0publicly humiliate himself,\" Richardson said, the Republic reports. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS From there, Rigsbee and Richardson say they tried to explain that they were afraid the police were going to be called unnecessarily, but the general manager didn\u2019t understand their concerns. \"Why do we continue to have to go through these things? And why was your first thought that we stole from you and not to say, 'We'll just go check the system?'\" Rigsbee recalled. \"Black Americans are being killed for doing nothing wrong on a daily basis,\u201d Richardson argued. \u201cAnd this is another instance where we could have lost our lives\u00a0if he would have finished that call with the police and have them come out for something we did not do. We had proof of our payments.\u201d Moving forward, the three customers planned to contact the restaurant\u2019s corporate office regarding the incident, the Republic reports, and they will surely not mince their words; the women all work at Rigsbee's law firm, where Rigsbee and Blassingame are attorneys.

We believe this was a very unfortunate mistake\u00a0on our part and we will further investigate internally to learn what went wrong and take appropriate steps to prevent it from happening in the future,\u201d said Spero G. Alex, Senior Vice President of Operations at the Cheesecake Factory Inc. \u201cWe had the opportunity to speak with one of the guests today and expressed our sincere apology.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0Good evening and welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, history on Capitol Hill, uncertainty on Wall Street and enthusiasm in Pennsylvania. There are eight days to go before Election Day and President Trump is out hosting several events in Pennsylvania while the former vice president also popped into the keystone state late today. Investors on Wall Street showing their concerns over the coronavirus spike and lack of new government help in the form of a stalled stimulus so far. The Dow finishing in the red, 650 after being off by almost a thousand points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 lost 64, the NASDAQ fell 189. Meantime, the U.S. Senate is poised to confirm President Trump's third U.S. Supreme Court nominee. The process after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just before the election has caused huge controversy and prompted Democrat vows of retribution. What that would look like, we don't yet know. The vote on the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett is expected in about an hour and a half. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram is live on Capitol Hill tonight with the very latest. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Justice Clarence Thomas will swear in Barrett tonight. This confirmation will long be known for speed cast against the specter of coronavirus just before an election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised just hours after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died that the Senate would muscle through a nominee despite the looming election. The Senate hasn't confirmed a nominee this late in a presidential election year ever. Democrats have tried to delay a vote on President Trump's nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett at every turn. This weekend, Democrats even expressed concerns about Vice President Mike Pence in his role of president of the Senate potentially presiding over the confirmation vote after multiple Pence's aids tested positive for the coronavirus. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The Republican Party is willing to ignore the pandemic to rush this Supreme Court nomination forward. God save us. PERGRAM: The Senate did kill a filibuster of the nomination with Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski arguing, it was too close to the election to fill a seat. But on Saturday, Murkowski threaded the needle. SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): Well, I oppose the process that has led us to this point. I do not hold it against her as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility. PERGRAM: The only Republican opposing Barrett is Maine Susan Collins, locked in a difficult reelection fight. There was always worry about the coronavirus as Republicans tried to confirm Barrett. Three GOP senators tested positive including Judiciary Committee members Mike Lee and Thom Tillis who attended Barrett's introduction at the White House in what turned out to be a super spreading event. Now, a few GOP senators are undecided about attending an evening swearing in ceremony for Barrett at the White House, others are cautiously on board. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I would anticipate that everybody will practice could so -- hygiene, social distancing or whatever is appropriate. I'm certainly not concern for myself and you know, I'll do -- I'll do my part. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: Clarence Thomas will swear in Barrett and with this vote, Republicans will have reshaped the Supreme Court for decades, Bret. BAIER: Big story, we'll see it live here on Fox. Chad, thank you. Also breaking tonight, we're now in the final full week before the presidential election and President Trump has just completed a third rally in this day through Pennsylvania. A three-rally swing. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins us tonight from Martinsburg where the present just wrapped up, that third stop of the day. A lot of people out there. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: A lot of very enthusiastic people and the Marine One will be spooling up to take the president back up to the airport that he landed at and back to D.C. tonight. You know, the old adage, Bret, is that in the last week of the campaign, you want to run as if you're 10 points down. For the president nationally and in some states, he's actually close to that mark but counting on enthusiasm like the three rallies he had today in Pennsylvania to turn around that equation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, everybody. Thank you. ROBERTS: President Trump with the Pennsylvania triple play today, three stops in Martinsburg, Lititz and Allentown. In the fracking capital of America, the president hammering Joe Biden's pledge to get rid of fossil fuels. TRUMP: Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry. I said, you mean no more oil, Joe? Well, that's what I mean. That means no fracking, no natural gas, no jobs, no energy for Pennsylvania families. He will eradicate your energy and send Pennsylvania into a crippling depression. ROBERTS: Down five points to Biden in the RealClearPolitics average, President Trump hoping lightning will strike twice and again hand him the keystone state's 20 electoral votes. TRUMP: I am running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. I am. I really believe that. Can you even imagine losing to a guy like this? ROBERTS: Joe Biden aiming to make the president eat those words by keeping up criticism of the White House's coronavirus response. After five of the vice president's staff tested positive, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows saying the drive is now focused on treatment over containment. MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: So, here's what we have to do, we're not going to control the pandemic, we are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation. There is -- JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Why aren't we going to get control of the pandemic? MEADOWS: Because it is a contagious virus just like the -- ROBERTS: The president firing back at Biden that his plan to deal with coronavirus would bankrupt the country. TRUMP: He wants to shutdown the whole country and we're rounding the turn. You know, all they want to talk about is COVID. By the way, on November 4th, you will be hearing so much about it. COVID, COVID, COVID. ROBERTS: The president today expanding on a tactic he first used Friday in Florida. Video vignettes of Biden over history. First on fracking, now on China and trade. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The rising China is a positive, positive development. ROBERTS: In the closing days of the campaign, the president trying to make Biden's own words one of his strongest assets. TRUMP: Pennsylvania lost almost 50 percent of its manufacturing jobs after Biden's NAFTA and China disaster. Sleepy Joe has betrayed Pennsylvania. How the hell can you vote for him? (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: The White House already indicating possible changes ahead and some of them definite if the president wins reelection. The senior administration official telling Fox News that if the president prevails on November third or whenever we know the results of the election, he will replace the FBI Director Christopher Wray, as well the Pentagon Chief Mark Esper will likely be out, Bret. BAIER: John Roberts traveling with the president in Pennsylvania. John, thanks. Joe Biden is once again trying to clarify his positions on issues such as energy policy and free college. The Democratic nominee spoke with voters and reporters this afternoon in Chester, Pennsylvania. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight from Wilmington, Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The closing days of the Biden campaign look a lot different than the closing days of the Trump campaign. BIDEN: We're going to be traveling, continue to travel, but the big difference between us and the reason why it looks like we're not traveling, we're not putting on super spreaders. DOOCY: In Pennsylvania, Biden continues trying to calm the nerves of energy concern voters. BIDEN: I'm not shutting down oil fields. I'm not eliminating fracking. I'm invested in clean energy. We're going to make sure that we don't continue to subsidize the oil companies. DOOCY: But that's not what he promised during the primaries. BIDEN: I guarantee you -- I guarantee you, we're going to end fossil fuel. DOOCY: The Democratic nominee is also putting a price tag on free tuition. BIDEN: I can send every single qualified person to a four-year college interstate for a 150 billion. DOOCY: But there's a catch. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: After our interview, Mr. Biden staff told us he misspoke and that the cost of free public college could be twice as much as he said. DOOCY: This week, Biden says he'll visit Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin and Florida. BIDEN: There has not been a day that hadn't been a 12-hour day yet. DOOCY: His V.P. nominee Kamala Harris is on the trail too but still hasn't hosted a formal press conference since joining the ticket. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And I promised Joe that I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And is that a socialist or progressive perspective? HARRIS: No. DOOCY: Foreign policy experience is part of what made Biden attractive as a running mate for Barack Obama, but it doesn't get a ton of attention on the trail. BIDEN: Well, I think the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our security, our alliances is Russia. DOOCY: That's an answer Obama dismissed when Mitt Romney made it. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And you said Russia, not Hokkaido, he said Russia. In the 1980s they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back. DOOCY: Obama is pitching Biden in swing states as more polite than the president. OBAMA: We're not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who he doesn't think is nice enough to him. DOOCY: But he did that to a group of noisy Trump supporters Saturday. BIDEN: I'll work as hard for those who don't support me as though should do including those chumps in the microphone out there. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Nobody crashed at the event this afternoon just inside the Pennsylvania, Delaware border as it wasn't on Biden's public schedule. It was more of a drop by a voter mobilization center. But curious voters who showed up after Biden had already arrived, couldn't get anywhere close, Bret. BAIER: You know, the president Peter was making that point out a couple of stops. When did the decision from covering the Biden campaign -- when did the decision come down that he was going to Pennsylvania? DOOCY: It was just this afternoon and we were sitting here doing a live shot and we watched as the traveling press pool had their temperatures taken and they were put on a bus. They did not know where they were going. We didn't know where they were going until they actually got there. And so, it is not something that if you want to go see Joe Biden and you live in Southeastern, Pennsylvania you can go and do. It kind of just have to be in the right place at the right time or invited by the campaign if you want to catch him. BAIER: All right, Peter Doocy with the campaign in Wilmington, Delaware. Peter, thanks. The global infection count for the coronavirus pandemic is now above 43 million tonight. The U.S. leads the way with that with an official count of about 8.7 million cases. New records are being set in a number of states every day on cases and also hospitalizations. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie has tonight's wrap up from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. is averaging 70,000 new coronavirus cases each day and broke records with more than 83,000 on Friday and Saturday. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm amenable to do anything that will stop the spread at this juncture. SERRIE: El Paso, Texas is open to temporary hospital at the Civic Center to handle an influx of patients. The county judge has imposed a 10:00 p.m. curfew that carries a $500 fine for violations. Cases are rising from the Texas border to the farms of Minnesota. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: The viruses in these rural communities. It's in your farmland. It's among all of you. SERRIE: But according to news reports in Utah, some mothers are taking to social media urging parents against testing their children in an effort to keep COVID numbers artificially low so that schools can remain open. Europe is seeing new surges in places that had suppressed previous outbreaks. Out of caution, this week's World Health Summit in Berlin is being held online. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest crisis of our age. SERRIE: AstraZeneca has announced the vaccine it's developing with the University of Oxford produces a similar immune response in young and older adults. This raises hopes the world will have a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci says the first doses will be limited and likely prioritize for frontline health care workers and high-risk individuals. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: When you talk about vaccinating a substantial proportion of the population, so that you can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak that very likely will not be until the second or third quarter of the year. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And just in the last hour of the governor of Idaho announced that he will be re-imposing some coronavirus restrictions after hospitals in his state report an influx of COVID patience. And starting Wednesday, Illinois health officials will be requiring bars and restaurants in suburban Cook County outside Chicago to close at 11:00 p.m. nightly, Bret. BAIER: Jonathan Serrie live in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you. That news spooked the markets. Let's get some analysis of what happened today on Wall Street and where the markets may be heading. Connell McShane of Fox Business Network joins us from New York. Good evening, Connell. CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, good evening to you, Bret. You know, it was a sharp selloff as you said at the top of the broadcast tonight, even though we came back at the end, it was still the worst day for the Dow since the third of September, down 650 points. And investors, they really pointed to two catalysts. One is the fear of more economic lockdown, due to an uptick in the virus what Jonathan was just reporting on. And two is the fading hope of more stimulus coming out of Washington. Now, in terms of stocks, the obvious place to look really these travel and leisure names: Royal Caribbean, United Airlines, Marriott, they've all been pressured for months. But on a day like this, they're going to fall by even more than on another day. World Caribbean down 9-1/2 percent. Technology as well, huge week for that sector. Amazon, Alphabet Google's parent and Apple, they all report earnings later in the week. They all were lower today. But in the midst of all this, any hope for market might be helped out by some sort of pre-election stimulus bill seems to be fading away even though White House officials are still pressing for some kind of action on items where there's mutual agreement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: We don't need a gigantic bill with a lot of areas, and this is the issue, they have nothing to do with COVID or the economy you see. We can fight that out over the election in a week or afterwards. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCSHANE: Well, late afternoon, conversation between the Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did last we're told almost an hour. No agreement though was reached, even though the Speaker's Office says she remains optimistic about a deal before the election. You heard Larry Kudlow, mentioning the stimulus fight continuing after the election. Well, some polls now showing key races that could decide control of the Senate are tighter than ever. And last week, Wall Street investors were actually pointing to the possibility of a democratic sweep. White House Senate in the House as making a more aggressive stimulus package more likely after November 3rd. And now, some rethinking that scenario. Bret? BAIER: OK, Connell, we'll track it. Thank you. Up next, the already shaky ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan brokered by the U.S. We'll explain. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 6 in Milwaukee as an effort to recall Wisconsin Democratic Governor Tony Evers fails. The drives organizer told supporters today their Facebook page did not collect enough signatures. Fox 2 in Detroit as city leaders and industry advocates unveil a new proposal that allows for the sale of cannabis in Detroit it also aims to guarantee some of that commerce goes to small businesses in the city. This occurs almost a year after marijuana's legalization in Michigan. And this is a live look at Daytona Beach from Fox 35. One of the big stories there tonight. A baby boy white rhino born at Disney's Animal Kingdom -- obviously in Orlando. Rhino Kendi gave birth to the baby Sunday morning. Within the first hour of being born, the rhino calf was nursing standing, and walking around near mom. There you go. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: A fast-moving wildfire has forced evacuations for 70,000 people in Southern California. Two firefighters have been seriously injured. Powerful winds across California have prompted power cuts for hundreds of thousands to try to prevent utility equipment from sparking new blazes. The fire in Orange County broke out just before 7:00 local time this morning. It quickly threatened neighborhoods in Irvine, that sprawling city of about 280,000 people nearby. What was Tropical Storm Zeta has now strengthened to a hurricane. It's on track from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula resorts, and then, likely will move on for a possible landfall on the central U.S. Gulf Coast at midweek. Zeta is the earliest ever 27th named storm of the Atlantic season. Scientists say water on the moon is more widespread than previously known. A research team is reporting the first unambiguous detection of water molecules on the lunar surface. Another team says the moon possesses about 15,000 square miles of permanent shadows that could potentially harbor hidden pockets of water in the form of ice. International news now. The U.S. is threatening to destroy Iranian-made missiles, should they be successfully shipped to Venezuela. State Department correspondent Rich Edson live tonight with what led to this extraordinary threat. Good evening, Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good evening, Bret. And senior U.S. official say they're deterring potential arms and missile shipments from Iran to Venezuela, even threatening to intercept or destroy them. Elliott Abrams is the State Department special representative for Iran and Venezuela. He tells Fox News, \"The transfer of long-range missiles from Iran to Venezuela is not acceptable to the United States and will not be tolerated or permitted. Iran has announced its intention to engage in arms sales, and Venezuela is an obvious target because those two pariah regimes already have a relationship.\" A senior administration official adds that the United States will make every effort to stop shipments of long-range missiles from Iran. And if they do arrive in Venezuela, the U.S. will, \"eliminate them\". The officials provided no information that Iranian armed shipments to Venezuela are happening now or are imminent when it comes to missiles, they only claim that Iran and Venezuela are a likely pair for this type of deal. Now, last week, this is part of the Iran nuclear agreement. A United Nations arms embargo against Iran, buying or selling conventional weapons expired. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, says that means his country can now purchase or sell arms from and to anyone they desire. On Venezuelan state television in August, disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro floated the idea of buying missiles from Iran. This afternoon, the U.S. Treasury Department announced more sanctions on Iran's oil sector, including four people that officials say are involved in selling Iranian gasoline to the Venezuelan government. And the U.S. has repeatedly layered on sanctions in the regimes in Caracas and in Tehran. Bret? EDSON: Rich Edson, live at the State Department. Rich, thank you. The Trump administration is announcing another round of potential arms sales to Taiwan. This comes on the same day, China slapped sanctions on U.S. defense firms. The latest package from the U.S. to Taiwan includes 400 Harpoon anti-ship missiles at an estimated cost of more than $2.3 billion. Last week, the State Department approved an arms deal to Taiwan for $1.8 billion worth of missiles, artillery, and sensors. Armenia and Azerbaijan are accusing each other of violating the new U.S. brokered ceasefire that was supposed to begin this morning. Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot is watching the situation tonight from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia continued today just minutes after a brokered ceasefire was set to take place. Each side blaming the other for violations. The pause brokered by Secretary of State Pompeo and foreign ministers of both countries was the third attempt to settle a dispute over the breakaway territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. President Trump had tweeted positively about it last night. \"Congratulations to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who just agreed to adhere to a ceasefire effective at midnight. Many lies will be saved. Proud of my team.\" When Fox News spoke exclusively last Friday with Azeri President Aliyev, he was optimistic too. Do you think there can be a peaceful resolution of this conflict? Do you think you can find that diplomatic answer? ILHAM ALIYEV, PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN: Yes. I am absolutely confident. But it depends on the will from Armenian side. PALKOT: Most telling, perhaps, a recent comment from the Armenian prime minister. NIKOL PASHINYAN, PRIME MINISTER OR ARMENIA (through translator): There is no way to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh issue through diplomacy for a long time. PALKOT: Hundreds have died including civilians and four weeks of fighting. The biggest flare-up since the 90s when tens of thousands were killed. A fear, local battles could spread regionally. Russia is an ally of Armenia, Turkey of Azerbaijan. Neighbor Iran is looking on. ALIYEV: We are completely against any form of internationalization of the conflict. PALKOT: Still, the international community including the U.S. is trying to find peace, and maybe some political gains. President Trump touts his administration's diplomacy. Armenian-Americans are part of the electorate in some swing states. Azerbaijan's leader says, he'll accept help how ever it comes. ALIYEV: Any motivation in order to put an end to hostility is supported by us. (END VIDEOTAPE) PALKOT: All sides are set to meet again in Geneva on Thursday, as efforts continue to stop the bloodshed for many reasons. Bret. BAIER: Greg Palkot in London. Greg, thanks. Up next, race, one of the top issues in this campaign. Tonight, an in-depth look at how that might affect the vote. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:\u00a0 This evening we continue our in-depth look at major issues for voters in the election. Tonight's focus, race and how it factors in this year. Here's correspondent Kevin Corke. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 A house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. Possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Two messages with competing visions of what racial reconciliation looks like. While former Vice President Joe Biden says his campaign will restore the soul of America, President Trump is promising economic renewal as a key to healing the wounds of racial injustice. And after a summer of unrest, it is an issue that carries particular political heft in 2020. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 I think we have a serious problem with racism, and I think it's more endemic than we really want to believe it is. And it's generational. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Our society was built on racism and systematic discrimination, and a lot of people are living into that without even knowing it. CORKE:\u00a0 Though he won just eight percent of the black vote in 2016, the president's primary pitch to African-American voters this time centers around economic issues -- pre-COVID record low unemployment, criminal justice reform, record funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Enterprise Zones designed to drive jobs into the community. The former vice president, meanwhile, is promising a collaborative community effort, bringing together stakeholders from across the spectrum to address inequality in the community. Still, for many voters, race is far from the most pressing issue facing the country right now, a possible reflection of the progress we've made, say researchers, on a still-very long road. DAVID BARKER, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY:\u00a0 Things are better, at least if you're at a certain age. Younger people who have not lived through those experiences that we have just come into things with a different set of expectations. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE:\u00a0 But the real battleground, Bret, in 2020, may be how to get more Hispanic support. Of course, the former vice president is doing well in early voting, but you may recall back in 2016, President Trump got about 30 percent of Hispanic support, and that's a figure that campaign officials tell me tonight that they are confident they will best in 2020. Bret? BAIER:\u00a0 We'll see. Kevin, thank you. Minnesota Republican Senate candidate Jason Lewis underwent emergency surgery for a severe internal hernia today. The Lewis campaign says the procedure was a success. It's believed he will be released from hospital in the next couple of days. Lewis is challenging incumbent Democrat Senator Tina Smith in what has become a very tight race, a major challenge to the incumbent there. Up next, we conduct a test to see just how reliable voting by mail really is. The results when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:\u00a0 If you're planning to vote early this week, you may see some long lines. Wait times vary from place to place. Early voting began in New York Saturday. Today was the first day in Maryland. Some cities, such as Los Angeles, are using sports arenas to handle large volume. Ohio is one of just five states with Sunday voting yesterday and again on November 1st. There are new developments tonight in the ongoing fight over the role of mail-in ballots in next week's election. There are worries about whether the U.S. Postal Service is capable of dealing with that volume. Senior correspondent Eric Shawn takes a look tonight from New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 For months, Americans have been worried about the reliability of mail-in ballots, that after the Trump administration changed postal service procedures. The agency says those moves have been put on hold until after the election, but concerns continue. A recent FOX News poll shows 34 percent of voters plan to mail in their ballots early, so we decided to test the dependability of the mail with our own experiment. Starting on September 14th, FOX News mailed 500 replica ballot envelopes from and within Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York. We mailed 100 envelopes from each city, 20 addressed to this P.O. Box we rented in New York City. The other 80, locally within each city, mailed for more than 50 mailboxes across the country. This is the first envelope that I'm going to mail. As you can see, we replicated the size and weight of a typical ballot. We are not only going to see how long it takes for these ballots to get to our Post Office box in Manhattan, but we're also going to see if some cities are slower. Our New York team and I mailed our simulated ballots from more than a dozen mailboxes within 67 miles of our Manhattan P.O. box. All of those envelopes arrived within two to five days. In fact, New York and Los Angeles batted 100 percent. Every envelope from those cities arrived. The longest took eight days. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Sir, could you please mail these for me? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Yes, no problem. SHAWN:\u00a0 But a chunk from Miami is still missing, and one envelope mailed from Chicago never showed up. As of today, out of the 500 envelopes we mailed, 11 did not reach their destination. Of those, nine are MIA, two are returned mailed from Dallas. In all, a little more than two percent of the total mailing never made it. It's worth noting that our mail test occurred before the recent crush of tens of millions of real mail-in ballots, which the postal service, by law, does identify as election mail and expedite, unlike our samples. A Postal Service spokesperson told us in part, quote, \"The Postal Service's number one priority between now and the November election is the secure and timely delivery of the nation's election mail,\" and that it, quote, \"cannot substantiate that our test represents a reasonable approximation of election mail.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) SHAWN:\u00a0 A report from the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General found mail delivery has slowed, citing in part the Trump administration's operational changes. Bret? BAIER:\u00a0 Fascinating. Eric, thank you. Up next, the confirmation vote for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, and the start of the final full week of the presidential campaign. We'll talk about all of it with an expanded panel when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 At last week's debate, Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry. Would you close down the oil industry? JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 I would transition from the oil industry, yes. TRUMP:\u00a0 Oh, that's a big statement. BIDEN:\u00a0 I will transition. That is a big statement. TRUMP:\u00a0 Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma? BIDEN:\u00a0 I'm not shutting down oil fields. I'm not eliminating fracking. I'm investing in clean energy, and we're going to make sure that we don't continue to subsidize the oil companies. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 Former Vice President Biden popping into Pennsylvania about 45 minutes from his house today as the president made three stops in Pennsylvania with big, big crowds at these events. There is one from Allentown earlier today. He made two more stops through the day, all outside, and the president sometimes going on for a long time. Now he's on his way driving back to the airport. Marine One had some weather issues. He'll be back for an event this evening for the swearing in of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Let's bring in our expanded panel, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, there you go, and Chris Stirewalt, politics editor here at FOX News. Brit, you look at these rallies, and people, we look back to 2016 and they say remember all the big rallies you had for President Trump, then- candidate Trump, at this time. Do you read anything into these rallies? BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:\u00a0 Well, I would size it up this way, Bret. We didn't think four years ago that rally size were a really good indicator and it turned out that they were. But at this stage I think it looks like this. Trump is behind in the polls, he is well behind in money, but he's ahead, and probably way ahead, on voter enthusiasm. The problem for him is that an unenthusiastic vote cast counts just as much as an enthusiastic one. So the question again comes down to, are the polls wrong, are they off? They were in a number of key states last time. Are they this time? I don't rule it out, but I don't think it's what I'd bet on. BAIER:\u00a0 Yes. Mara, you had the former vice president pop in to Pennsylvania late in the day. It was not scheduled. If you take a look at the calendar, today the president had those three stops, as I mentioned, in Pennsylvania. Tomorrow Vice President Biden is in Georgia, Warm Springs and Atlanta. The president is in Lansing, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nebraska. They don't have a schedule for the vice president on Wednesday. The president is in Arizona, two stops on Wednesday. Thursday Biden is in Florida, two stops. Friday, Iowa and Wisconsin, and the president has pledged to do more stops, obviously, later in the week. He's clearly going after the barnstorming effort. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Right. There's no doubt that he -- the big rallies, the packed schedule, that's part of his brand. And I think he's trying to make the argument, look, Joe Biden isn't as strong as me, as energetic as me, he keeps a very mild schedule. But if you look at that calendar that you just recited, Donald Trump, by definition, he was the winner last time, is playing a lot of defense. But Joe Biden is going to places like Georgia and Iowa. That shows you how confident the campaign is, the Biden campaign is, at the same time as they are not taking his birth state for granted. He was in Pennsylvania today, and doing a little cleanup about the comments about the oil industry, although Biden people tell me they haven't seen any evidence in their polling that that gaffe, you could call it, that statement, has moved any votes. BAIER:\u00a0 Well, they consider it a gaffe, Ben, because they spent all day kind of trying to dial it back. LIASSON:\u00a0 They spent a lot of time cleaning up, but they are not seeing any evidence yet that it's moving things in any way. BAIER:\u00a0 Got it, I understand what you're saying. Ben, what about -- so the debate performance for Joe Biden, then you have a lot of the focus on the \"60 Minutes\" piece was about President Trump and Leslie Stahl and the president walking out. But the interview with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that Norah O'Donnell did, take a listen to one little clip here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 So are you going bring the policies, those progressive policies that you supported as senator, into a Biden administration? SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 And is that a socialist or progressive perspective? HARRIS:\u00a0 No. (LAUGHTER) HARRIS:\u00a0 No, it is the perspective of a woman who grew up a black child in America who was also a prosecutor, who also has a mother who arrived here at the age of 19 from India, who also likes hip-hop. (LAUGHTER) HARRIS:\u00a0 What you want to know? (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 What did you make of that interview? I thought Norah O'Donnell did a nice job pressing on substance, but it's really some of the more pointed questions that Senator Harris has received since becoming the nominee. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\":\u00a0 It was kind of a demonstration of how few questions she's gotten since being a nominee in any capacity that really challenged her. She seemed to be genuinely surprised when Norah O'Donnell put in front of for the fact that the independent GovTrack declares that Kamala Harris is the most liberal member of the Senate in terms of her voting history. She seemed genuinely surprised to learn that, which I thought was kind of interesting. If you look at this situation right now, Bret, the last time around in 2016, my experience was the pollsters were urging humility on the part of the lot of the news reporters. When I was covering it for a different network at that time four years ago, the attitude really was let's be more humble. Let's have a little humility here about the numbers that we are seeing. Let's not be eager to call it for Hillary Clinton. This time around it seems like things have flipped a bit. The pollsters seem very confident in their numbers. They seem to be ready to say they've seen enough, especially at the congressional district level, while there are a lot of reporters out there who have paid a lot of attention closely to this race who see it more as a situation that could come down to Pennsylvania, who believe that President Trump might overperform when it comes to the Hispanic community that we see across the sun belt and in states like Florida and Arizona. It's just interesting to me how the dynamic has shifted, and I think a lot of people feel a little snake-bit by what they expected to happen in 2016. They worry that that might happen all over again. BAIER:\u00a0 Chris, do you sense that Democrats are feeling a little anxious about being this confident at this point? CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL EDITOR:\u00a0 They're a wreck. There's nothing like a good hand to make a Democrat a nervous wreck. And they are reliving -- when I talked to people I know in Biden world, when I talk to members of Congress, stuff like that, they are beside themselves because -- and I can tell them anything I want about margins of error and data and all of that stuff. They don't care, because they remember, as Ben describes it, that horrible feeling of snake-bit. They were too confident in 2016. One of the reasons Biden has been so successful this time around is that they have played as safe as they possibly could on all fronts, and they have been very careful not to act braggadocious or overconfident, and that has frankly been good for them and kept their voters motivated. BAIER:\u00a0 Let me play this soundbite from the White House chief of staff over the weekend getting a lot of attention, Brit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:\u00a0 We are not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get a vaccines, therapeutics, and other mitigation -- JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR:\u00a0 Why aren't we going to get control of the pandemic? MEADOWS:\u00a0 Because it is a contagious virus, just like the flu. TAPPER:\u00a0 Yes, but why not make efforts to contain it? MEADOWS:\u00a0 We are making efforts to contain it. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 And obviously the Biden campaign quick to say that this was a white flag-waving. Your thoughts, Brit? HUME:\u00a0 Well, if you look at what's happening in much of Europe now, when they are having new cases -- of course you don't always know when you are about cases how sick anybody is and, more important than that, how likely they are to die. Nonetheless, there's a lot of alarm in Europe now, a place where experts in America were saying they did it right over there and we didn't, and therefore we are having the spikes and they're not. And now they are, which suggests what I think Mark Meadows was getting at, which is this is a highly contagious disease. We are in the middle of it, of a pandemic. People get sick. But outside of elderly people or people with certain preexisting conditions, the recovery rate is 99 percent or more. So that's the good news. So to say that we can't control it in the sense that we can't prevent their being more cases may just be common sense based on experience. BAIER:\u00a0 Yes. I want to end with the soundbite just because I found it interesting going back to 2012 and something the former vice president said on \"60 Minutes,\" asked about the biggest national security risk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaeda is a threat because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not Al Qaeda. You said Russia. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because the Cold War has been over for 20 years. SEN. MITT ROMNEY, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 First of all, Russia, I indicated, is a geopolitical foe. OBAMA:\u00a0 Not number one -- ROMNEY:\u00a0 Excuse me, it's a geopolitical flow. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 I think the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our security and our alliances is Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 The staff took time to dig that up, so I wanted to play it. Panel, thanks for the time, appreciate it. When we come back, the big finish. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER:\u00a0 Finally tonight, crossing the finish line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER:\u00a0 That's Washington football team head coach Ron Rivera receiving an outpouring of support just a day after he coached his team to a victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Rivera left the hospital in Virginia following his final chemotherapy treatment for cancer, a much bigger win, even more than the Cowboys. Congrats, coach. And on the 75th anniversary of the battle of Iwo Jima, 96-years-old World War II para-Marine Fred Harvey became the oldest to complete the Marine Corps Marathon, which he did virtually in Texas. Harvey, who fought in Iwo Jima, was pushed for 26 miles, then stood and crossed the finish line. That's awesome. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now. Hey, Martha. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Mike Pence is expected to accept the nomination for a potential second term as vice president in the Trump administration on Wednesday, when he speaks on the third night of the 2020 Republican National Convention (RNC). Trump announced Pence as his running mate in July 2016. The pick erased all lingering doubts among conservatives about Trump\u2019s political leanings. Before becoming VP, Pence was the governor of Indiana between 2013 and 2017. Prior to that, Pence served in Congress as a U.S. representative for more than a decade. Pence was born and raised in Indiana. Initially a Roman Catholic and a Democrat, he became an Evangelical Christian and a Republican while in college, a shift he has attributed to the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Throughout his political career, Pence has consistently implemented conservative policies. As governor, he signed off on one of the largest tax cuts in the state\u2019s history -- a move later credited with boosting Indiana\u2019s GDP above the national average. Vice President Mike Pence speaks during the first day of the Republican National Convention, Monday, Aug. 24, 2020, in Charlotte, N.C.\u00a0 (AP) His administration later came under fire over the passage of a religious freedom law that critics said could allow businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Amid backlash, the law was later amended to ensure that it did not permit discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgender people,\u00a0and others. Before entering politics, Pence hosted a radio talk show in the 1990s called\u00a0\u201cThe Mike Pence Show.\u201d He described himself as \u201cRush Limbaugh on decaf.\u201d A common quip he uses --\u00a0\u201ca Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order\u201d -- he first used on his radio program.

His published speeches have been more deliberate and scripted in sharp contrast with Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff style.",

A black community activist who trained\u00a0San Jose police recruits on implicit bias for three years was shot in a\u00a0testicle by a rubber bullet\u00a0during a recent protest, prompting the city's mayor to say that more needs to be done to confront police brutality \u2014\u00a0but that\u00a0defunding police will only undermine those efforts. Derrick Sanderlin, a 27-year-old community organizer, suffered potentially permanent injuries by a rubber bullet at a May 29 protest demonstration, the mayor\u2019s office said in a press release Monday. Sanderlin, who knows San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia personally, said he was disheartened to see how officers were treating protesters. Video captured by KABC-TV\u2019s news helicopter overhead purportedly showed the moments an officer fired a riot gun at Sanderlin, who had approached with his hands up. NEW YORK VOTES TO MAKE LONG-SECRET POLICE CONDUCT RECORDS PUBLIC IN WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS \"I really just couldn't watch it anymore,\" Sanderlin said. \"And just kind of made like a parallel walkover, put my hands up, and just stood in the line of the fire and asked them to please not do this.\" \"I pause for a moment like maybe this isn't, maybe this doesn't hurt and falling afterwards is like the most painful experience,\" he said. Sanderlin, who required emergency surgery on his testicle, said doctors told him they wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if the injury rendered him unable to father children until he and his wife tried to conceive. \"And I just started weeping at the thought of that,\u201d his wife, Cayla, whom he married four years ago, said. \u201cYou know, we, we do want kids and we're very close to having kids.\" In response to the incident, Garcia called Sanderlin personally and issued a statement, saying: \"Derrick has been a real leader in our communities' efforts to reduce bias and discrimination through dialogue. I assured him we will be investigating this incident.\" \u201cThe way they've treated people out there has ... been really heartbreaking because the chief is like a good person, who's really trying to do the right thing,\" Sanderlin told KABC. CHARLOTTE DEFUNDS PORTION OF POLICE BUDGET FOR TEAR GAS, CHEMICAL AGENTS A protester confronts San Jose police as they advance on Friday, May 29, 2020, in San Jose, Calif., as people demonstrate nationwide in response to George Floyd dying while in police custody on Memorial Day, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) His attorney, Sarah Marinho, who is filing Sanderlin\u2019s lawsuit against the city and police department, argued officers \u201cwere aiming for a body part that is prohibited when using those type of riot guns. You're not meant to aim at the groin or the head ever.\u201d Garcia has defended his officers\u2019 use of force during demonstrations and Capt. Jason Dwyer, the department\u2019s special operations commander, has likened the situation in the streets to a \u201cwar zone,\u201d Fox 23 reported. One officer, Jared Yuen, 33, has been placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation into his behavior after he was seen shouting expletives at a female protester and firing rubber bullets at another man in two separate viral videos. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo \u2013\u00ad\u00a0who has since proposed a ban on police use of rubber bullets \u2013\u00ad\u00a0responded to the incident involving Sanderlin on Monday, rolling out a series of police reforms to be adopted in the city's budget next fiscal year to\u00a0further hold officers accountable. In\u00a0the same breath, Liccardo said defunding the police \u2013 the latest demand advocated by Black Lives Matter after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis \u2013 would undermine those reforms and only hurt black communities.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) \"We have much work to do to confront our long and terrible history of police brutality against black and brown Americans,\u201d Liccardo said Monday. \"Defunding urban police departments won\u2019t help us do it.\u00a0 It is the wrong idea at the worst possible time and the budget released tomorrow will reflect that.\" The mayor noted that all new initiatives require funding, especially to backfill the thousands of police hours that are spent in training classes instead of on patrol. He\u00a0argued that though the San Jose Police Department has \u201cmade recent progress in eliminating the longstanding disparity between officers' use of force rates and arrest rates against persons of color,\u201d the police reforms started in San Jose in previous years need to go farther. Liccardo said additional changes should include altered union contracts and repealing laws that create obstacles to ensuring officer accountability \u2014 particularly the firing of bad cops. \u201cDefunding police undermines progress on these and other tools to improve accountability, training and recruiting,\u201d Liccardo said. Citing U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data, the mayor's office said, \u201ccommunities of color are disproportionate victims of serious and violent crimes, and that any cuts in police staffing will disproportionately harm the very communities that need to see progress.\u201d \"Defunding police will hurt the very people who have suffered the most from systemic racism in this nation,\" Liccardo continued. \"Rich, white communities and businesses in suburban malls will just accelerate the hiring of private security guards.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP His new police reforms include\u00a0collecting data to track every patdown, stop, arrest or use of force by race, and publishing that data; hiring external experts to analyze data and make recommendations; investing millions of dollars in body-worn cameras and video data storage; imposing mandatory training for officers in violence de-escalation and implicit racial bias; utilizing data tools to detect misconduct-prone officers earlier; enhancing psychological testing and screening in the city's police academies; and intentional investment in recruiting officers to better reflect the community's diversity.",

Hanlon Jr. wrote in a statement Monday. \u201cIn addition, measures will be put in place by our athletic director to review any planned pre-game displays for possible connections to any form of discrimination or particular political views.\u201d After the game last Friday, members of the community stirred up a debate over whether the display was an innocent move in support of local first responders or of it had racial connotations, prompting some residents to reach out to\u00a0district administrators directly, according to Hanlon. He said that running out onto the field with the flag \u201ccould be interpreted as a racially motivated action\u201d and he also noted that district policy \u201cdoes not permit engagement in political activity.\u201d OHIO DEPUTIES RAISE 'THIN BLUE LINE' FLAG OUTSIDE JUSTICE CENTER AFTER US FLAG STOLEN BY PROTESTERS, SHERIFF SAYS Hanlon also\u00a0acknowledged the schools\u2019 close ties with first responders after a shooting at Chardon High School eight years ago left three students dead and injured two, including one who became paralyzed.

(iStock) \u201cIt does not appear that this action was motivated by racism, rather a show of support for one of our coaches who serves as a police officer, as well as for the first responders in our community who have developed a special relationship with our school and students in the wake of our school tragedy of February 27, 2012,\u201d Hanlon wrote. Frank Hall, a former assistant football coach and teacher at the school, received national praise after he charged at the gunman and later prayed with the victims. Days after the shooting, he pushed back at the attention and said the real heroes were the emergency responders who rushed to the scene. \u201cI only wish I could have done more,\u201d he said in 2012. \u201cI'm not a hero.

Sign up\u00a0here.**On the roster: Top House Republican sounds alarm - Biden says he would make masks mandatory - Trump way back in Florida as seniors bolt for Biden - White House weighs new mass-testing effort - Hot copyTOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN SOUNDS ALARMWaPo: \u201cHouse Minority Leader\u00a0Kevin McCarthy\u00a0(R-Calif.) acknowledged concerns Friday that President Trump\u2019s sagging popularity could possibly hurt Republican chances in races key to maintaining the party\u2019s majority in the Senate. McCarthy, speaking during a television interview, was quick to add that he thinks Trump will ultimately prevail against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and that prospects would brighten for Republicans once the campaign comes into fuller view. \u2018If the election was today, yes, you\u2019re concerned,\u2019 McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News. \u2018Can we do better? Yes, we can.\u2019 Still, the candid public admission from the top-ranking House Republican was notable at a time when the party is increasingly worried about the prospect of not only losing the White House but also having Democrats gain control of both chambers of Congress.\u201dTrump fumbles on goals for second term -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cFor the second time in two weeks, President Trump joined his friend\u00a0Sean Hannity\u00a0for a televised conversation on Thursday. Near the end of the discussion, the Fox News host offered Trump a chance to summarize his reelection pitch. \u2018What\u2019s at stake in this election as you compare and contrast?\u2019 Hannity asked. \u2018And what is \u2014 what are your top priority items for a second term?\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Well, one of the things that will be really great,\u2019 Trump replied. \u2018You know, the word \u2018experience\u2019 is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I\u2019ve always said that. But the word \u2018experience\u2019 is a very important word. It\u2019s an \u2014 a very important meaning. I never did this before,\u201d he continued. \u2026 \u2018Now I know everybody,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I have great people in the administration\u2026.\u2019\u201dAdministration backs nixing ObamaCare coverage for millions -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cThe Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act in a legal brief filed Thursday\u2026 The administration\u2019s continued support for toppling the ACA is a political gamble as jobless claims stabilize around a historic high of about 20 million because of the pandemic. Democrats, including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, are seeking to portray President Trump as endangering health coverage at a time when more than 120,000 people have died from coronavirus. \u2026 A decision invalidating the ACA would be a shock to the U.S. health system. It wouldn\u2019t only end coverage for the 11.4 million people who signed up for insurance for this year, but also halt the expansion of Medicaid that covers more than 12 million people. Insurers would again be able to deny people health coverage or charge higher premiums to consumers with pre-existing conditions \u2026 Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to release a new, better health plan but hasn\u2019t done so.\u201dHalf of voters strongly disapprove -\u00a0NPR: \u201cAfter weeks of protests against police brutality and racism, and amid a renewed spike in coronavirus cases, the number of voters disapproving of the job President Trump is doing is at an all-time high, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Trump's approval rating sits at just 40% overall, while a record 58% disapprove. What's more, a whopping 49% of voters \u2018strongly disapprove\u2019 of the job Trump is doing. That kind of intensity of disapproval is a record never before seen for this president or any past one. In the general election matchup, former Vice President Joe Biden leads Trump by 8 percentage points, 52% to 44%. That's a considerable margin, and it's especially important that Biden is above \u2014 not just reaching \u2014 50%. But it's not as wide a lead for Biden as other surveys have found recently.\u201dCancels weekend trip to New Jersey country club -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cPresident Trump canceled his weekend trip to Bedminster, N.J. on Friday after the state imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for individuals traveling into the region from states seeing a surge in positive cases of COVID-19. The president was scheduled to leave Washington D.C. for Trump National Gold Club in Bedminster Friday afternoon, but the White House made an announcement that the trip had been canceled. It is unclear, at this point, exactly why the president\u2019s plans changed. Trump is deemed \u2018essential\u2019 and is not subject to the quarantine recommendations. When asked whether the cancellation was related to New Jersey's new travel restrictions, White House spokesman\u00a0Judd Deere\u00a0told Fox News, \u2018It has nothing to do with that.\u2019\u201dNoonan: \u2018The week it went south for Trump\u2019 -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cSomething shifted this month. Donald Trump\u2019s hold on history loosened, and may be breaking. In some new way his limitations are being seen and acknowledged, and at a moment when people are worried about the continuance of their country and their own ability to continue within it. He hasn\u2019t been equal to the multiple crises. Good news or bad, he rarely makes any situation better. And everyone kind of knows. \u2026 His long-term political malpractice has been his failure\u2014with a rising economy, no unemployment and no hot wars\u2014to build his support beyond roughly 40% of the country. He failed because he obsesses on his base and thinks it has to be fed and greased with the entertainments that alienate everyone else. But his base, which always understood he was a showman, wanted steadiness and seriousness in these crises, because they have a sense of the implications of things. He doesn\u2019t understand his own base. I\u2019ve never seen that in national politics.\u201dTHE RULEBOOK: ONCE UPON A TIME\u2026\u00a0\u201cIn the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.\u201d \u2013\u00a0John Jay,\u00a0Federalist No. 2TIME OUT: E.T.

Biden made the comments in an interview with CBS affiliate KDKA, in which he spoke about what he thinks should be done to reopen the country from the coronavirus shutdown. He said that he wants to see greater use of masks. \u2018The one thing we do know, these masks make a gigantic difference. I would insist that everybody in public be wearing that mask,\u2019 he said. \u2018Anyone to reopen, it would have to make sure that they walked into a business that had masks.\u2019 The interviewer asked if he would use \u2018federal leverage\u2019 to mandate mask-wearing, \u2018Yes, I would from an executive standpoint, yes I would,\u2019 he said, to which the interviewer asked if he would then be mandating mask-wearing.\u201dVoters not wound up about Biden veepstakes, race not a factor -\u00a0NYT: \u201cJoseph R. Biden Jr. appears to face limited political pressure from voters about whom to choose as his running mate, with no contender emerging as a clear favorite and the great majority of people saying that race should not be a factor in his decision, according to polling conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. \u2026 In the Times poll, four in five registered voters said that race shouldn\u2019t be a factor in Mr. Biden\u2019s selection of a running mate. That group included three-quarters of the black voters polled, and more than 8 in 10 white and Hispanic voters. About a fifth of black voters said they would like to see Mr. Biden choose a black running mate. The largest group with that preference was very liberal voters, at 37 percent; 27 percent of voters with postgraduate degrees said the same. The poll asked respondents if they thought Mr. Biden should chose a black running mate or a white running mate or if race shouldn\u2019t be a factor.\u201dTRUMP WAY BACK IN FLORIDA AS SENIORS BOLT FOR BIDENFox News: \u201cVoters think Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is better suited to handle the issues of the day, expanding his lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground state of Florida. Biden tops Trump by 9 points, 49-40 percent, in a Fox News survey of Florida registered voters. That\u2019s up from a 3-point edge in April (46-43 percent). Among those \u2018extremely\u2019 motivated to vote, Biden\u2019s lead grows to 11 points (53-42 percent). In 2016, Trump received 49 percent of the vote, winning the Sunshine State by one point. The former vice president owes his advantage to the backing of Hispanics (+17 points), women (+18 points), and Millennials born between 1981 and 1996 (+30).\u201dTexas undecideds sour on Trump -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cTexas is a tossup, as Democrat Joe Biden tops President Donald Trump by a percentage point, 45-44 percent, in a new Fox News survey of Texas registered voters. Ten percent are up for grabs, and this small subgroup of voters is more likely to disapprove than approve of Trump\u2019s job performance by 52-34 percent. The good news for Trump: he bests Biden by 51-45 percent among those \u2018extremely\u2019 motivated to vote in the election. Trump corralled the Lone Star State by 9 points in 2016 (52 percent vs. Hillary Clinton\u2019s 43 percent), and it has been in the Republican column in every presidential election since 1980.\u201dTrump, Tillis in tough reelection bids in Tar Heel state -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cPresident Donald Trump trails Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by a 47-45 percent margin, according to a Fox News survey of North Carolina registered voters. That 2-point edge is within the survey\u2019s margin of sampling error. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by nearly four points in North Carolina in 2016. If the election ultimately is about the economy, that should help Trump.\u00a0By a 9-point margin, Tar Heel voters think he would do a better job than Biden at managing it. If it turns on race relations, Biden has a 13-point advantage over the president. \u2026\u00a0Currently, [Sen. Thom Tillis] is 2 points behind Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, 39-37 percent.\u00a0Six percent of voters back a third-party candidate and another 15 percent are undecided.\u201dNot so peachy for Trump: Georgia a dead heat -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cDemocrat Joe Biden is narrowly preferred over President Donald Trump in a new Fox News survey of Georgia registered voters. Neither candidate receives majority support in the head-to-head presidential matchup, as Biden garners 47 percent to Trump\u2019s 45 percent.\u00a0 Biden\u2019s 2-point edge is within the poll\u2019s margin of error and nearly one out of ten voters is up for grabs. More Republicans (71 percent) than Democrats (65 percent) feel \u2018extremely\u2019 motivated about voting this fall.\u00a0 That puts Trump (49 percent) over Biden (47 percent) by 2 points when the race is narrowed to just\u00a0\u2018extremely\u2019 motivated voters. Trump won Georgia by 5 points in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by a 51-46 percent margin.\u201dWHITE HOUSE WEIGHS NEW MASS-TESTING EFFORT\u00a0WaPo: \u201cThe Trump administration is weighing a new testing strategy as coronavirus cases mount: testing groups of people together. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [said] that health officials are having \u2018intense discussions\u2019 about what\u2019s known as \u2018pool testing.\u2019 The idea is that by testing samples from many people all together, officials could test more people with fewer resources. And those who are infected could be more quickly found and isolated. Pool testing would allow officials to cast a much broader net to find cases faster. It would represent a dramatic shift from how coronavirus testing is currently being carried out in the United States \u2013 but one that may be sorely needed as virus hot spots worsen and new ones appear. \u2018Something\u2019s not working,\u2019 Fauci said of the current approach. \u2018I mean, you can do all the diagramming you want, but something is not working.\u2019\u201dAbbott slams shut partial reopening -\u00a0Texas Tribune: \u201cGov. Greg Abbott on Friday took his most drastic action yet to respond to the post-reopening coronavirus surge in Texas, shutting bars back down and scaling back restaurant capacity to 50%. He also shut down river-rafting trips and banned outdoor gatherings of over 100 people unless local officials approve. \u2018At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars,\u2019 Abbott said in a news release. \u2018The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and protect public health.\u2019 Bars must close at noon Friday, and the reduction in restaurant capacity takes effect Monday. Before Abbott's announcement Friday, bars were able to operate at 50% capacity and restaurants at 75% capacity.\u201dSenate GOP getting antsy despise Pence efforts to placate -\u00a0Politico: \u201cAs coronavirus cases spike across the country, President Donald Trump and his top officials say everything is mostly under control. But Senate Republicans are pressing them to show a little urgency. The latest outbreaks are also reshaping the GOP\u2019s political and legislative strategy, with Republicans planning to focus more on health care in the next coronavirus relief bill. And they\u2019re flashing rare frustration at the Trump administration for its decision to wind down federally supported testing sites. \u2026 Meanwhile Trump is still downplaying the virus\u2019 impact, questioning the value of testing and ridiculing the idea of wearing a mask despite holding large-scale campaign rallies. But mask-wearing has become virtually ubiquitous among GOP senators and some are now urging Trump to set an example by wearing a face covering, which medical experts say helps slow the spread of the virus.\u201dBarr intensifies warnings about mass fraud in mail-in ballots -\u00a0NBC News: \u201cAttorney General William Barr on Thursday raised concerns that expanding mail-in voting could lead to widespread fraud \u2014 but admitted he had no evidence to support his claims. In an interview with NPR, Barr was asked if he believes an election conducted mainly by mail can be secure. \u2018Personally, no. I mean, we just mailed out checks under this program. And what is it? I heard something like 20 percent or something were misdirected,\u2019 Barr said, referring to stimulus checks sent out by the federal government as part of a coronavirus relief package. Barr said that he thinks the same thing can happen with mail-in ballots. \u2018I know things can happen like that,\u2019 he said. \u2018Because I know people move, a very high percentage in the United States, people move all the time. And I also know that you can easily take things out of mailboxes.\u2019\u201dPARTISANSHIP-CHOKED CONGRESS SET TO FLOP ON POLICING\u00a0Politico: \u201cAs the United States faces its biggest crisis over civil rights in decades, Congress is poised to do nothing. Again. What could have been a searing, soul-searching moment where America\u2019s political leaders helped establish a new national accord on race and the role of police in society has instead devolved into a frenzy of political posturing, campaign sloganeering and ugly partisan fights. The House on Thursday passed a sweeping police reform bill that would ban chokeholds, end the use of \u2018no-knock\u2019 warrants, create a national registry for officers accused of misconduct, and make it easier to prosecute officers. Yet Democrats picked up only a few GOP votes, guaranteeing the proposal has no chance of moving in the Senate. And the Senate can\u2019t even agree to begin debate on a police reform bill, with Democrats blocking efforts to take up a proposal drafted by Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), one of two Black Republicans on Capitol Hill.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYHow restaurant habits foretell surges in corona -\u00a0BloombergStatehouse candidate\u2019s daughter takes to Twitter begging followers to vote against her dad\u00a0- NY PostHouse approves DC statehood bill, GOP calls move Dem \u2018power grab\u2019 - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: FROM THE BAYOU TO THE GLACIERS\u00a0\u201c[Joe Biden\u2019s] not a very gimmicky kind of person, and I don\u2019t think people are looking for a gimmicky president.

If this is our country\u2019s future, then I think we should not single out the police. Qualified immunity should then be stripped from all local, state and federal government employees. Included in this list should be politicians, teachers and professors of all public and private schools and universities.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.[Ed. note: We should first be clear in what we\u2019re talking about when we say, \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d It is a legal doctrine that, under a 1982 Supreme Court decision, protects officers from lawsuits unless they knowingly violate the legal and constitutional rights of a suspect. As time has gone by, courts have made it harder and harder to sue police officers for misconduct on the job. There\u2019s evidence that the doctrine is changing, though. The high court this month rejected an appeal from an innocent Idaho woman whose home police destroyed with tear gas grenades, but the number of cases that address police misconduct is mounting. After almost 40 years, there\u2019s increasing pressure to revisit the doctrine. The original intent of the doctrine as it took form in the middle of the last century was to prevent harassing plaintiffs from basically bankrupting jurisdictions with frivolous lawsuits. Those kinds of protections are likely to remain for police and all public officials, but what is likely to change are the ways in which courts broadly apply the protections as it relates to police misconduct.]\u201cYour lead analysis of 25 June is what I have been saying for months! Thank you for putting it so much more lucidly than I ever could. Beware of who the DNC picks to run as VP candidate. (S)he could very well be the next President!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tom Scherer, Udonthani, Thailand[Ed. note: I note that the president has scrapped his plans for a weekend at his New Jersey country club. Is this a sign of the ship turning or just another zigzag? And if he is trying to get a hold of himself and his campaign, can he stick with it? The answers to those questions may decide whether this is a campaign or a boat race and whether Republicans get wiped out up and down the ballot like they did in 1958.]\u201cI appreciate and value your commentary and insight every day. I also appreciate your links to Judge Napolitano, specifically the link on Thursday which nominally addressed \u2018Statues Protest\u2019 but which was powerful and perspective changing, in his blunt assessment of what he referred to as the \u2018slavery afterlife.\u2019\u00a0Can we ever muster the political and social will to address and redress the economic punishment inflicted upon African Americans for the last four centuries? I would argue that an aggressive and reformed inheritance tax (one with reasonable and modest exemptions to protect the inheritors) could be put to use...to transfer wealth from a small number of citizens to a far larger number of citizens. I recognize this defeats the expectancy interests of a small number of \u2018innocents.\u2019 I believe this might however, remove a major objection from the majority of citizens (and the argument that they should not be taxed/punished for the sins of their ancestors to favor a disadvantaged group of contemporaries).\u00a0I make no pretense to understand how the funds would be fairly or effectively applied to redress economic wrongs. I do however believe that a dedicated source of funds, collected over a few generations might be sufficient to provide some equitable relief and balance the economic scales.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Dennis Cline,\u00a0Purcellville, Va.[Ed. note: Many others share your view, Mr. Cline, about ways to address the injustices of the past without acting unjustly now. On a practical basis, I would caution you that those families in possession of great fortunes have long ago figured out creative ways of avoiding inheritance taxes through foundations, trusts, etc. The taking would have to be pretty blunt and pretty aggressive. Then come the questions about qualifications for benefits. Should someone who emigrated from Africa recently get the same share as an American descendant of slaves? Should the percentage of enslaved ancestors be determinative in the awarding of benefits? Or should we go back to the Jim Crow standards and base it on an individual\u2019s complexion? It gets pretty ugly pretty fast. Leaving aside the scheme that would be used for implementing reparations, though, I worry about the focus on this as a matter of relief. Slavery and then Jim Crow used the force of law to deny human beings not just the chance to amass wealth but also to receive quality educations and enjoy other public goods -- from advancement in the military to little league to summer job\u00a0programs to swimming lessons. Race-based legal discrimination was followed with an attempted remedy under presidents\u00a0Lyndon Johnson\u00a0and\u00a0Richard Nixon\u00a0that sought to remedy the questions of wealth accumulation and the denial of public goods through massive new federal spending and public welfare programs. The results have been, at best, mixed.\u00a0The numbers\u00a0on America\u2019s black middle class are grim. A stable place in the middle class means not just money but durable families and institutions that can perpetuate generational advantages. Sadly, the same problems are badly afflicting working-class white communities. While an affluent elite -- an increasingly diverse one, at that -- pulls away from the pack thanks to the advantages of stable communities, strong institutions and an achievement-oriented culture, poorer Americans are left behind in places with weak institutions, high crime, rampant addiction and mass despair. That is then made worse by policing that all too often becomes a revenue source in poor places. Fines, asset forfeiture and general hassling become a de facto tax on poor people, especially poor black people. The two Americas are different in wealth, yes, but more damagingly, they are different in access to the things that make advantages sustainable. We have, as\u00a0Charles Murray\u00a0put it, come apart. Dumping money on those problems will not fix them. I\u2019m not saying that the descendants of slaves aren\u2019t owed for their ancestors\u2019 bondage, but I am saying that the issues facing America today are far more cultural and institutional than they are about money. Money can be a tool for addressing these issues, but only a tool.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.HOT COPYDetroit Free Press: \u201cPeople are getting creative when it comes to staying safe from COVID-19 and it has prompted at least one Michigan library to issue a public warning: Stop microwaving books.

Library books have metal in the security radio frequency identification (RFID) tags,\u00a0 which are located inside of the book.

            "article_content": "Rev. Eugene Rivers III previews Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing on 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' The very first question of the debate between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden concerned the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. If there\u2019s one thing the already-pitched political battle establishes, it\u2019s the\u00a0imperial\u00a0nature of our judiciary. Today\u2019s Supreme Court ultimately decides nearly every political, social\u00a0and economic issue of consequence. It shouldn\u2019t. The court\u2019s decades-long power grab threatens the very fabric of our democracy. Even before Justice Ginsburg had been laid to rest, and prior to knowing the identity of the nominee, the Women\u2019s March pledged vehemently to oppose any woman \u2013\u00a0no matter how qualified and regardless of her views. And the speaker of the House proposed all sorts of shenanigans to prevent the president from fulfilling his constitutional role of nominating Supreme Court justices \u2013\u00a0from packing the court to holding sham impeachment proceedings. REP. MARK GREEN: LEFT WRONGLY ATTACKS BARRETT FOR HER RELIGIOUS FAITH\u00a0\u2013 I WAS VICTIM OF SAME PREJUDICE Meanwhile, those on the left have leveled vicious personal attacks on Judge Barrett for everything from the sincerity of her religious beliefs, to her family\u2019s adoption of two children from Haiti, to (of all things) her ability to be both a successful working woman and loving mother. Confirmation hearings were not always so contentious. Indeed, the Senate approved all of President George Washington\u2019s nominees by voice vote just two days after their nominations.\u00a0And one of those nominees turned down the job. But the Supreme Court held a much more boring place in American democracy at the time of our founding. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton commended the judiciary as the \u201cleast dangerous branch.\u201d Responding to concerns that the Supreme Court might usurp powers that properly belong with the legislature or the people, Hamilton argued that there was zero danger of the court becoming\u00a0imperial, and that the judiciary was destined to become the \u201cweakest\u201d of the three branches. How times have changed. Just last term, the Supreme Court issued major decisions on everything from abortion and immigration to religious liberty and the validity of presidential subpoenas.\u00a0A majority of the nine justices decided that the executive branch may not ask a citizenship question on the census, can exempt religious organizations from the contraceptive mandate, and failed lawfully to revoke DACA\u2019s protection for Dreamers. It rewrote the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. And it held that a state may not require abortion doctors to hold admitting privileges at a hospital. On all of these questions, it was five elite, unelected members of the judiciary \u2013 not the people\u2019s elected representatives \u2013 who had the power to decide how to handle such policy questions. Given this reality, it\u2019s no surprise that Hamilton\u2019s description of the court as the \u201cleast dangerous\u201d branch is now cited only ironically. Given the current power of the federal judiciary, American voters are right to focus on nominations to the Supreme Court. The American public knows how powerful today\u2019s Supreme Court is. Indeed, for the first time, a large number of 2016 presidential voters identified Supreme Court nominations as the deciding factor in their vote. According to Pew Research, 65% of those polled before the election stated that Supreme Court appointments would be \u201ca very important factor\u201d in determining their vote. Exit polling showed\u00a0that the Supreme Court swayed the election \u2013 a majority of voters who believed the court to be the most important consideration voted for Trump. And according to the Washington Post, a full quarter of Trump voters told pollsters that the president\u2019s ability to nominate Supreme Court justices motivated their vote. The Biden campaign has fully bought into the idea of an\u00a0imperial\u00a0Supreme Court. During the\u00a0debate, Biden refused to condemn court-packing sending a clear message: if the Democrats get power, they would consider packing the Supreme Court to get the results they want. Further, many of the\u00a0issues\u00a0facing our country, everything from the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, to preexisting conditions coverage, climate change, environmental regulation, the COVID-19 response, and racial justice,\u00a0will end up being decided by the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court. The problem with this view of the Supreme Court is obvious: it turns the idea of self-government on its head. Our forefathers fought for the right of ordinary citizens to participate in government, to have a voice in the direction of the country. These rights are illusory if each and every one of the \u201cexistential issues\u201d facing our country ultimately is decided by unelected and unaccountable judges. The threat to American democracy posed by the Supreme Court is exacerbated by the ever-expanding influence of the administrative state. Expert administrators \u2013\u00a0and not elected officials \u2013\u00a0increasingly make decisions about every aspect of American life. From dictating when a farmer may plow her field, to what sort of insurance an employer must offer, to what kind of car we are allowed to drive, it is administrative experts and not elected officials who decide. The progressives who championed the creation of administrative agencies believed that bureaucratic experts were best suited to solve the problems of the day and purposefully sought to insulate government administrators from electoral accountability. Couple rule by an administrative agency with judicial supremacy and you get a form of government that is less and less responsive to the will of the people. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Given the current power of the federal judiciary, American voters are right to focus on nominations to the Supreme Court. They are also right to insist that their elected representatives make good on their promises to appoint pro-Constitution judges who will respect the rule of law. But as the political battle looms over Justice Ginsburg\u2019s replacement, we also need to remind our elected representatives of a forgotten line from Federalist 78 \u2013\u00a0that \u201cthe power of the people\u201d is supposed to be \u201csuperior\u201d to the judicial power.

            "article_content": "Fedida denies reports of racist slurs. A top ABC News executive has been fired after being placed on administrative leave over racist remarks she reportedly made about Black employees. Last month,\u00a0Huffington Post's Yashar Ali laid\u00a0out damning accusations against Barbara Fedida, head of ABC News talent, and her treatment of Black journalists at the network including \"Good Morning America\" anchor Robin Roberts. On Monday,\u00a0Fedida's termination was announced in a memo to ABC News employees from\u00a0Walt Disney Television chairman and Disney Media Networks co-chairman Peter Rice. \"The investigation substantiated that Ms. Fedida did make some of the unacceptable racially insensitive comments attributed to her. It also substantiated that Ms. Fedida managed in a rough manner and, on occasion, used crass and inappropriate language.\" Rice told employees, according to the memo obtained by Fox News. \"Lastly, the investigation found no basis for the claims that Ms. Fedida was the subject of dozens of HR complaints and that ABC News spent millions of dollars in confidential settlements related to Ms. Fedida, as alleged in some press accounts.\u201d ABC NEWS ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE OVER RACIST REMARKS ABOUT BLACK ANCHORS: REPORT \"Although Ms. Fedida made contributions to the organization over the 20-year span of her career, in light of the overall findings, we have determined that she can no longer serve in a leadership role and will not be returning to ABC News,\" Rice\u00a0said in the memo. According to the memo, Fedida's now-vacant role will be restructured by the network because of the manner in which she \"wielded the power\" in that position. ABC News nor representatives of\u00a0Fedida immediately responded to Fox News' requests for comment. \"The View\" on Monday addressed the controversy that rocked ABC News over the weekend, resulting in the administrative leave of its top executive Barbara Fedida. In 2018, during a contentious meeting about renewing\u00a0Robin Roberts'\u00a0contract,\u00a0Fedida reportedly\u00a0\"asked what more Roberts could want and said it wasn\u2019t as if the network was asking Roberts to 'pick cotton.'\" Fedida also reportedly referred to \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin as \"low rent.\" Another source told Ali about a comment Fedida said about then-ABC News journalist\u00a0Kendis Gibson, a black anchor, that ABC \u201cspends more on toilet paper than we ever would on him.\" 'GMA' ANCHORS SIDE WITH ROBIN ROBERTS WHILE ADDRESSING ABC EXEC CONTROVERSY According to the\u00a0report, Fedida would also refer to women as \"c---s\" openly in the office. Ali wrote that he had spoken with \"34 sources\u00a0over the course of six months\" comprised of current and former ABC News staff. \"To say that she\u2019s an abusive figure is an understatement,\u201d a former ABC News staffer told the Huffington Post. In a statement to Fox News, ABC News said at the time:\u00a0\"There are deeply disturbing allegations in this story that we need to investigate, and we have placed Barbara Fedida on administrative leave while we conduct a thorough and complete investigation. These allegations do not represent the values and culture of ABC News, where we strive to make everyone feel respected in a thriving, diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d Fedida began working at ABC News back in 1989 as a staffer for anchor Peter Jennings and had risen in the ranks among executives. After leaving the Disney-owned network in 2005 for an executive position at CBS News, Fedida returned to ABC News in 2011. \"Normally, a talent executive in a network news division is responsible for finding new talent, and developing and working with the network\u2019s current talent. Fedida does all that at ABC News, but her role and influence go far beyond that. She is essentially a deputy to Goldston and has been tasked with being an enforcer and dealing with all of the difficult issues he doesn\u2019t want to handle,\" Ali wrote, referring to ABC News president James Goldston. EX-CNN ANCHOR SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: NETWORK EXEC TOLD HER TO ONLY HAVE THE 'RIGHT KIND' OF BLACK GUESTS Fedida was reportedly dismissive of the\u00a0National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) despite her role of elevating diversity at the network. Unlike most network executives, she would skip the organization's annual convention. A letter from NABJ was reportedly sent to Goldston laying out ambitions\u00a0to increase diversity, including having one senior Black producer on every program and interviewing Black candidates for all job openings. However, Fedida, along with other executives,\u00a0reportedly referred to the letter as a \"Black manifesto.\" The NABJ issued a statement on June 13 calling for \"ABC News/Disney to\u00a0immediately launch a transparent, external investigation led by a diverse law firm to examine all of the allegations detailed in [Yashar Ali's] report, while conducting a thorough review of ABC News Exec Barbara Fedida and the talent dept [sic].\" The NABJ also called on ABC News to \"waive its confidentiality agreements with any Black employees and other employees of color, and permit prior and current employees to speak on the record absent of reprisals if they choose to do so.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP According to Ali, at least a \"dozen\" HR complaints were made against Fedida over the years and\u00a0her conduct \"has led to millions in confidential settlements including at least one settlement involving allegations of racial discrimination.\" \"For years, Fedida's conduct, not just when it comes to race & racism, has been widely discussed in the media business. People have wondered how she has managed to keep her job. She and others have managed to kill stories about her conduct in the past,\" Ali noted.",

            "article_content": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies at age 87. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the enigmatic, longtime Supreme Court justice who attained near cult-like status among progressive circles, died\u00a0Friday at the age of 87 from complications surrounding metastatic pancreatic\u00a0cancer. The late Supreme Court justice, who spent more than two decades on the bench in the highest court of the land, is survived by her two children, Jane Carol and James Steven Ginsburg. \u201cOur Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature,\"\u00a0Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. said in a Friday evening statement. \"We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her -- a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\u201d Ginsburg, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, was known for her soft-spoken demeanor that masked an analytical mind, a deep concern for the rights of every American and a commitment to upholding the Constitution. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, right, administers the oath to defend the Constitution to Ruth Bader Ginsburg as President Bill Clinton looks on in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, Aug. 10, 1993. (Associated Press) \"She changed the way the Supreme Court views the issue, and she changed millions of people's lives in the process,\" said David\u00a0Schizer, who served as a law clerk during Ginsburg's first year on the high court bench in 1993. \"She did it with her soft-spoken, quiet manner. She understood if you're trying to do something momentous, you should present it as quite ordinary.\" READ: SUPREME COURT'S STATEMENT ON RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S DEATH She had battled back from two forms of cancer in the past but her health began to take a downturn in December 2018 when she underwent a pulmonary lobectomy after two malignant nodules were discovered in the lower lobe of her left lung. On Jan. 7, 2019, the Court announced she would miss oral arguments that day for the first time since she joined as she continued to recuperate from that surgery. Born in 1933 in Brooklyn, N.Y., young Ruth's early influence was her mother, Celia, who instilled in her daughter the value of education and dignity. \"She taught me,\" Ginsburg said, \"be someone who holds fast to her convictions and her self-respect, someone who is a good teacher, but doesn't snap back in anger.\u00a0Recriminations do no good.\" To her lifelong sadness, Ruth Bader's mother died of cancer the day before her high school graduation in 1948. RUTH BADER GINSBURG UNDERGOES PROCEDURE AT NYC HOSPITAL, EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED BY END OF WEEK \"I had the good fortune to be a Jew born in the U.S.A. My father left Odessa bound for the New World in 1909, at age 13,\" Ginsburg reminisced in 2004 at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony. \"My mother was first in her large family to be born here, in 1903... What is the difference between a bookkeeper in New York's Garment District and a Supreme Court justice? Just one generation, my mother's\u00a0life\u00a0and mine bear witness.\" \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAssociate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sits with fellow Supreme Court justices for a group portrait at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, Nov. 30, 2018. (Associated Press) As a child,\u00a0Ginsburg\u00a0wanted\u00a0to be an opera star, but soon found her brain would carry her farther than her voice, which remained tinged with a thick New York accent. She finished first in her class as a Cornell undergrad. She completed her first two years of law school at Harvard Law School and transferred to Columbia Law School for her final year.\u00a0Harvard awarded her an honorary degree in 2011. While in law school,\u00a0she juggled raising a daughter, helping her husband Martin recover from cancer, and finishing her own studies. As one of nine women at Columbia Law, her initial reception was chilly, with one professor telling her and the eight other women of the Class of 1959 how it felt to take the spots that should have gone to more \"qualified\" men. She made the law review, and finished as the top student at Columbia, where she had transferred in her third year. Those impeccable academic credentials evidently were not good enough for Ginsburg to get a job in a New York law firm or a top judicial clerkship. So she went into teaching, and found a new calling. \"Those experiences along with others really galvanized her interest in women's rights litigation,\" said Margo\u00a0Schlanger, a Washington University law professor and former Ginsburg law clerk. RUTH BADER GINSBURG HAS BEEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY TO TREAT RECURRENCE OF CANCER Her personal experiences collided with monumental social changes in the 1960s. While teaching at Rutgers, Ginsburg feared losing her non-tenured position when she became pregnant, so she wore large clothing to hide it. One of the first cases she helped litigate involved teachers forced to give up their jobs when they became pregnant. U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participates in a discussion at Georgetown University Law Center July 2, 2019 in Washington. (Getty Images) \u201cI had the great fortune to be alive and a lawyer in the late 1960s,\" said Ginsburg, \"when for the very first time in the history of this country it became possible to\u00a0urge before courts successfully that society would benefit enormously if women were regarded as people equal in stature to men.\" With the help of her students, Ginsburg argued six cases before the Supreme Court in the 1970s, winning five of them before an all-male group that included her future\u00a0benchmates\u00a0William Rehnquist, Harry Blackmun, and John Paul Stevens. Her strategy was to take a measured approach, carefully choosing cases that would promote equality but not appear radical to often skeptical federal courts. \"It was very much with the model of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall,\"\u00a0Schlanger\u00a0said. \"She had this idea that you have to build precedence step-by-step.\" GINSBURG EVISCERATES 9TH CIRCUIT'S HANDLING OF IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT'S CASE Ginsburg also tried to expand the 14th Amendment's traditional ban on racial discrimination to gender, and to show the effect stereotyping had on limiting opportunities for women. \u201cRace discrimination was immediately perceived as evil, odious, and intolerable,\" Ginsburg said during her 1993 confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. \"But the response I got when I talked about sex discrimination was, 'What are you talking about? Women are treated ever so much better than men.' I was talking to an audience that thought... I was somehow critical about the way they treated their wives and their daughters.\" Among the cases she argued:\u00a0Weinberger v.\u00a0Wisenfeld\u00a0(1975), in which a father wanted to stay home and take care of his young son after his wife had died suddenly in childbirth. Social Security would not pay benefits for the man, even though had the situation been reversed, the woman would receive money, based on the man' salary. The thinking was: husbands earned the money, the wife took care of the house and family. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously for the father. President Bill Clinton names Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden of the White House, Washington DC, June 14, 1993. (Getty Images) But that careful approach and her belief that \"courts needed to be educated\" had its critics. Some feminists believed differences in the sexes, in many cases, should allow for preferred treatment for women, instead of a pure gender-neutral lens. \u201cI know there are people who think those cases didn't go far enough,\" said\u00a0Schlanger, \"and the theories of equality that say men and women should be treated basically without much distinction by the law is not everyone's favorite approach to equality. But that's not a view [held by more radical gender activists] that was very likely to succeed, and her approach did succeed.\" RUTH BADER GINSBURG RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER INFECTION That success brought Ginsburg a national reputation and in 1980 President Jimmy Carter nominated her to the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Thirteen years later, President Clinton chose her to fill the Supreme Court seat of retiring Justice Byron White, citing not only her experience but her \"big heart.\" Ironically some of the opposition to her nomination came from feminists, who did not like her criticism over the legal reasoning of\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which permitted abortion. That ruling grounded first trimester abortions in the right to privacy, thereby overturning state laws that varied widely on access to the procedure. Ginsburg believed a more gradual liberalization to abortion would have kept the issue back in the states, avoiding the social and political upheaval that has been part of Roe's legacy. The law on abortion was evolving at the time of\u00a0Roe, Ginsburg recalled in 2005. \"The Supreme Court stopped all that by deeming every law-- even the most liberal-- as unconstitutional. That seemed to me not the way courts generally work.\" But Ginsburg, in her rulings, upheld reproductive choice. \"When government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a full adult human being responsible for her own choices,\" she said during her confirmation. One of Ginsburg's first clerks on the high court was David\u00a0Schizer, later dean at Columbia Law School, Ginsburg's alma mater. Despite being the first justice named by a Democratic president in 26 years, and her generally left-leaning views,\u00a0Schizer\u00a0recalls how quickly she fit in with the legal and social culture of this exclusive \"club.\" RUTH BADER GINSBURG DECRIES WASHINGTON 'DYSFUNCTION' AMID IMPEACHEMENT TRIAL \"People who don't agree with her policy instincts still think the world of her as a judge. Justice Scalia [the late conservative] once said if he were ever stranded on a desert island with a liberal, he'd want it to be Ruth Ginsburg.\" Clerks and staff described her as a mother figure of sorts, keeping track of birthdays, anniversaries, even dentist appointments. Despite deep affection and a nurturing personality, she was also a stern taskmaster, pushing hard for excellence in the often tedious, detailed-oriented work of the Court: preparing arguments, writing opinions. Ginsburg, friends said, was even harder on herself, often working all night. She has been known to take a flashlight to a movie theater, catching up on her caseload, while still following the plot. In 1999, came a near tragedy. Diagnosed with colon cancer, she underwent emergency surgery, yet two weeks later, she was back on the bench. While keeping up her workload, she had chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Her only public words at the time: \"I am still mending but have progressed steadily.\" \"Some of us were angry with her, but we were wrong,\"\u00a0Schizer\u00a0said. \"We kept telling her to slow down, we kept telling her to take it easy, I sent her a couple of fiction books to read, and she wouldn't have any of it. She just bore down, went through the [cancer] treatment,\u00a0treated\u00a0it as part of her work. It was a lesson to me in how to deal with adversity, and she dealt with it with grace. And she basically refused to let anyone help her, because the way she could help herself was by doing things herself.\" A 2009 diagnosis for pancreatic cancer led to fears she would retire then, but again, Ginsburg was back on the job within days, even working on her caseload from the hospital bed after initial surgery to remove the tumor. A year later, she was on the bench the day after her husband Martin died from cancer, telling friends privately he would have wanted it that way. ERA: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT Later in her career, she developed an Internet cult following as the \"Notorious RBG,\" for her blistering dissents on divisive issues, and for her octogenarian workout routines inside the court's gym. But controversy followed her, too, for her pointed 2016 criticism of then-candidate Donald Trump, calling him, among other things a \"faker.\" The power of a justice comes from the strength of the opinions she writes, whether it breaks new constitutional ground, or affirms existing precedent. Bridging consensus helps build allies to one's views on often hot-button issues. Ginsburg, say legal scholars, tended to rule on procedure, rather than establishing broad principles of social reform. That strategy not to overreach won her admiration from her more conservative colleagues, but her generally liberal record remained intact. Yet she never backed down from her often tough-sounding rhetoric. On the death penalty, she wrote a 2004 majority opinion slamming Texas prosecutors for their behavior in a capital trial, which the Court found was riddled with errors, and worse. \"When police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching material, we hold it is ordinarily incumbent on the state to set the record straight,\" she wrote. \"A rule declaring 'prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek,' is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord\u00a0defendants\u00a0due process.\" Dissenting in 2003's high-profile case throwing out Michigan's controversial affirmative action program for undergraduate students, Ginsburg declared, \"The stain of generations of racial oppression is still visible in our society, and the determination to hasten its removal remains vital.\" RUTH BADER GINSBURG TEMPORARILY BLOCKS RELEASE OF TRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS Perhaps Ginsburg's most important ruling in her early years on the bench was on a subject she knew well. In 1996's U.S. v. Virginia, the Court ordered state officials to admit women to formerly all-male Virginia Military Institute. In her landmark opinion, she concluded the \"skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights or opportunities based on sex responds to volumes of history.\" She noted efforts to create an elite military corps \"is great enough to accommodate women, who today count as citizens in our American democracy equal in stature to men. Just as surely, the State's great goal is not substantially advanced by women's categorical exclusion, in total disregard of their individual merit.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In law and life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a role model to the many people she encountered over the years. Her message of success and tolerance go hand in hand, as she explained in 1999, just a month after undergoing cancer surgery: \"The challenge is to make and keep our communities places where we can\u00a0understand, accommodate and celebrate our differences while pulling together for the common good.\" Ginsburg added: \"No door should be closed to people willing to spend the hours of effort needed to make dreams come true.\" Fox News\u2019 Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.",

NASA's first black administrator reflected on the ongoing protests against racism and police brutality in the U.S. during a recent interview. Charles Bolden, who served as administrator of the space agency from 2009 to 2017, told Space.com that he's \"on a constant roller coaster of being very angry and then being hopeful.\" Across the country, demonstrations that have erupted over systemic racism and police brutality have drawn hundreds of thousands, prompted some cities to consider cutting police budgets and led to reckonings over racism in media. \"The systemic problem with racism in the United States is not something that started this year or last year or 10 years ago,\" Bolden, 73, told Space.com. \"This is what our nation was founded on.\" Some of the space agency's activities under Bolden's leadership include landing on Mars with the Curiosity rover, launching a spacecraft to Jupiter, enhancing the nation's fleet of Earth-observing satellites, and moving toward the 2018 launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. LAWMAKER BLASTS AMAZON'S 'PERFORMATIVE' SUPPORT OF BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT Former NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden spoke about racism during a recent interview. (NASA/Bill Ingalls) \"I don't have any stories that are any different from anybody else's,\" Bolden said. \"Being a black man in America means that every single day I go through what all of us do, and I could walk out of my apartment right here in Crystal City, Virginia [just outside Washington, D.C.] \u2026 and I could have the same thing happen to me that happened to George Floyd,\" he said, referencing the unarmed black man's death while in police custody in Minneapolis. \"That's just a fact of life.\" CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS DEMAND FACEBOOK ADVERTISING BOYCOTT OVER PROMOTING 'HATE, BIGOTRY' The former NASA administrator is old enough to recall previous upheavals around racial injustice during the 1960s and 70s\u00a0and said in the interview that more non-black people need to speak out. Bolden is no stranger to discrimination, having almost not made it to the Naval Academy because he is black, as he told NPR in 2016. \"When we look in the mirror, we're looking at something we don't like. Well, that is the nation that we are, and it's up to every single one of us to change it,\" Bolden said. \"So I call on my White brothers and sisters and tell them: Everything you want me to say or you like [retired black astronauts] Leland [Melvin] or Mae [Jemison] saying, you ought to be saying it.\" Bolden's 34-year career with the Marine Corps -- he's a retired major general and flew more than 100 combat missions in Vietnam -- also included 14 years as a member of NASA's Astronaut Office. After joining the office in 1980, he traveled to orbit four times aboard the space shuttle between 1986 and 1994, commanding two of the missions and piloting two others.",

            "article_content": " This week, gadfly New York Times columnist Bari Weiss resigned her position at the so-called newspaper of record. She did so after years of fielding slings and arrows from her own colleagues and editors, who treated her as an ultra-conservative enemy -- this despite the fact that her perspective on the world is an eclectic mix of social progressivism, skepticism toward regulation and foreign policy hawkishness. (Personal disclosure: I, along with many people right, left and center consider Bari a friend.) The pressure on Weiss from within the newspaper had reached extraordinary proportions: Excerpts of staff Slack chats revealed colleagues openly discussing why Weiss ought to lose her job, maligning her as a bigot and suggesting publicly that she is a liar. JUDITH MILLER: RISE AND FALL OF NEW YORK TIMES WRITER BARI WEISS \u2014 A VICTIM OF FAR-LEFT INTOLERANCE So Weiss quit, and she burned the bridge behind her. \"The lessons that ought to have followed the election -- lessons about the importance of understanding other Americans, the necessity of resisting tribalism, and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society -- have not been learned,\" Weiss wrote in her resignation letter. \"Instead, a new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper: that truth isn't a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else.\" This is the nature of the game: Mirror the perspectives of de facto Times editor Nikole Hannah-Jones and her woke colleagues, or find yourself ostracized, publicly shamed and pressured to leave. And the actual editors of The Times have caved to this nonsense time and again. As Weiss raged: \"If a person's ideology is in keeping with the new orthodoxy, they and their work remain unscrutinized. Everyone else lives in fear of the digital thunderdome.\" Weiss is hardly the exception inside the bastions of leftist groupthink. At Vox , co-founder Matthew Yglesias was shamed into silence for suggesting -- sin of sins! -- that cancel culture is wrong. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER His co-founder, Ezra Klein, subtweeted Yglesias, even as Yglesias remained quiet. At Princeton University, professor Joshua Katz wrote an open letter decrying demands from fellow Princeton faculty that the university engage in open racial discrimination in favor of minorities. He was quickly labeled a threat to decency, with fellow professor Eddie Glaude complaining, \"Professor Katz, at times in this letter, seems to not regard people like me as essential features, or persons, of Princeton.\" The list goes on. And on and on. In fact, there is only one way to avoid the blacklist: to surrender, utterly and completely. Any sign of remaining dissent must be purged. Bow before Zod, or pay the price. Thus, Ben Howe (again -- personal disclosure -- a friend), an anti-Trump Republican who edited videos for the pro-Joe Biden Lincoln Project, found himself fired from the project for two- and four-year-old tweets. Thus, Gary Garrels, senior curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, was forced to resign his position after he insisted that the museum continue to acquire the odd piece from white artists. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mildest sign of unwillingness to become an \"ally\" in the Great Culture Purge of 2020 ends with your neck in the guillotine. Have we finally reached the glorious age in which Absolute Truth is known with such fulsome certainty that our cultural betters should be trusted to wish dissenters away into the cornfield? Of course not. We're just watching the latest cultural revolution in real time. Which leaves those who wish to not be purged with two simple choices: Stand up together against this round of Maoist purification, or hang separately.",

            "article_content": "2020 presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden is proving to be a challenge to define in the presidential race; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Wake up America! That message trended on Twitter recently, for good reason;\u00a0it is\u00a0100 days to the election,\u00a0and\u00a0Americans\u00a0need to\u00a0wake up to what a Democrat sweep might do to this country. Our nation is under attack.\u00a0\u00a0The riots\u00a0that have convulsed our cities may have started as\u00a0protests against\u00a0the brutal murder of George Floyd, but that is not what is\u00a0driving the lawlessness\u00a0today. In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, a black NAACP leader in Portland, Rev. E.D.\u00a0Mondaine, describes recent protests in his city as \u201clargely a white spectacle\u201d that will do nothing to further equal rights for black people. He asks, \u201cWhat are\u00a0Antifa\u00a0and other leftist agitators achieving for the cause of black equality?\u201d ANDREW McCARTHY: TRUMP WON'T ACCEPT ELECTION RESULTS? LET'S LOOK AT THE LAW Good question. Left-wing protesters and their allies in the liberal media have\u00a0a bigger, more dangerous agenda\u00a0than racial equity. Joe Biden has promised to \u201ctransform\u201d this country\u00a0and \u201cend shareholder capitalism\u201d; progressives\u00a0are pushing\u00a0to make sure he does just that. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Here is what should\u00a0alarm\u00a0patriotic\u00a0Americans:\u00a0if Democrats capture the White House and the Senate in November, as\u00a0some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest players are\u00a0now\u00a0betting,\u00a0the far Left \u2013 think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes -- will be in charge.\u00a0This is not an exaggeration. Progressives like\u00a0members of the so-called\u00a0\u201cSquad\u201d\u00a0have scared Establishment Democrats by out-raising them on the campaign trail and unseating several old-school politicians\u00a0such as, most recently, Eliot Engels\u00a0of New York. AOC and others are threatening to \u201cprimary\u201d even senior members of their party; those under threat are tacking hard Left to head off a potential rival. There is even speculation that AOC herself might run in 2022 to unseat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who might by then be majority leader; Schumer has recently cast votes that may signal concern about just such a challenge. Asked if she might try to topple Schumer, AOC didn\u2019t rule it out. No one is safe. Consequently, our country is not safe. These radical Democrats could indeed alter the course of our nation, and not in a good way. Ignored by all but the most ardent fans of MSNBC,\u00a0Democrats in the House have\u00a0been busy passing\u00a0an extensive progressive wish-list\u00a0that\u00a0has\u00a0gone nowhere, thanks to the GOP majority in the Senate. That could change. The recent history of New York\u00a0politics\u00a0provides some perspective.\u00a0For years, Republicans\u00a0controlled\u00a0the\u00a0New York State Senate, even as they lost the assembly and the governor\u2019s office.\u00a0In the majority, they blocked\u00a0the liberal\u00a0Democrat\u00a0agenda. But in 2018 Democrats won control of the state Senate, promising\u00a0to unleash\u00a0a torrent of\u00a0pent-up\u00a0legislation that, as the New York Times predicted, would \u201cfundamentally alter the state\u2019s economic and political fabric next year and beyond.\u201d Unlimited full-term abortion, \u201cbail reform\u201d that made it almost impossible to lock up criminals, new gun control legislation, mandatory paid leave, tough laws that handcuff cops; as the Times reported, \u201cWith Democrats in firm control in Albany, lawmakers carried out a progressive agenda that had long been thwarted.\u201d This urge to\u00a0\u201cfundamentally transform the state\u2019s economy, infrastructure and social norms\u201d\u00a0which, by the way, is not working out so well for New Yorkers,\u00a0could\u00a0go national if\u00a0Democrats win all three branches of government. So\u00a0what kind\u00a0of\u00a0legislation\u00a0has been\u00a0stalled in\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u2019s House? Many other initiatives included in the Biden-Sanders Unity Platform, such as outlawing \u201cright to work\u201d laws, union-boosting measures, elements of the Green New Deal and laws to limit school choice will follow. Among the bills under consideration is the Gun Violence Prevention and Community Safety Act of 2020, which makes it very tough to buy or sell a gun and removes limitations on the civil liability of gun manufacturers. In other words, gun makers could be held responsible for shootings in which their weapons were used. Kiss good-bye the U.S. gun industry, and Second Amendment rights. Also moving through the legislative process is the New Way Forward Act, which effectively creates open borders. It would require immigration judges to \u201cimpose the least restrictive detention conditions necessary\u201d and repeal \u201cprovisions providing criminal penalties for improper entry or reentry into the United States.\u201d In\u00a0short,\u00a0under this House bill people entering the country without\u00a0papers\u00a0would no longer\u00a0face prosecution. Next stop: voting rights. Another House bill in the works is the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, introduced by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. Her bill would create a commission to \u201cexamine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.\u201d The Joe Biden- Bernie Sanders \u201cUnity Platform\u201d embraces this\u00a0divisive undertaking. Already passed by the House is the For\u00a0The\u00a0People Act, which makes changes to redistricting and limits removing voters from voter rolls. This latter provision would open the door to extensive fraud as the nation allows more voting by mail. Now why would Democrats want that? And then there was the $3 trillion Heroes Act passed by the House, which incorporated a laundry list of Democrat priorities, including new bank regulations designed to promote racial equity, measures to expand the marijuana trade, payouts to people in the country illegally, and strictures against voter IDs. This is just a sampler of the bills wending their way through the House, looking for an open door into the Senate. Many other initiatives included in the Biden-Sanders Unity Platform, such as outlawing \u201cright to work\u201d laws, union-boosting measures, elements of the Green New Deal and laws to limit school choice will follow. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This election is by no means over.\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s lead nationally and in some critical swing states has\u00a0narrowed\u00a0in the past couple of weeks as\u00a0more\u00a0Americans became angry about attacks on cops, the toppling of national monuments,\u00a0the \u201ccancel culture\u201d\u00a0and \u2013 perhaps most important \u2013\u00a0angry about\u00a0the progressive agenda now being promoted by\u00a0a\u00a0supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d\u00a0candidate desperate to win over the radical members of his own party.

            "article_content": "Power Player of the Week: Civil rights icon John Lewis Two Republican senators mistakenly used photos of Elijah Cummings in tributes meant to honor a different late black congressman, Rep. John Lewis, who passed away last week. Sens. Marco Rubio, from Florida, and Dan Sullivan, from Alaska, both tweeted tributes to Lewis on Saturday. Lewis, D-Ga., died Friday night after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 80. \u201cIt was an honor to know & be blessed with the opportunity to serve in Congress with John Lewis a genuine & historic American hero,\u201d Rubio tweeted Saturday. \u201cMay the Lord grant him eternal peace.\u201d PRESIDENT TRUMP PLAYS TRIBUTE TO JOHN LEWIS, A 'CIVIL RIGHTS HERO' In this Feb. 15, 2011, photo, President Barack Obama presents a 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Lewis, who carried the struggle against racial discrimination from Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress, died Friday, July 17, 2020. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) \u201cCongressman Lewis\u2019 courage and principled leadership helped guide America through one of the most challenging periods in its history, calling our country to live up to its ideals with justice and equality for all people regardless of color and creed,\u201d Sullivan wrote in his own message on Facebook. But both messages\u00a0included photos of the late Rep. Cummings, who died in October. Cummings, also a civil rights activist, served in the House of Representatives for Maryland's 7th Congressional District, which includes Baltimore, until his death at age 68. In a follow-up tweet, Rubio acknowledged \u201cEarlier today I tweeted an incorrect photo.\u201d \u201cJohn Lewis was a genuine American hero,\u201d he said. \u201cI was honored to appear together in Miami 3 years ago at an event captured in video below. My [sic] God grant him eternal rest.\u201d Rubio shared a link to a video of him and Lewis together in Miami on Martin Luther King Day in 2017. Sullivan revised his Facebook post to remove the same photo showing Cummings at the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, The Guardian reported. His updated post linked to Lewis' obituary in The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0and removed the reference to the museum. The photo of Cummings was taken in February 2014 by the Philadelphia Inquirer photojournalist Lauren Schneiderman. It has since been removed from Schneiderman\u2019s personal website, but screenshots showed it was mislabeled as depicting Lewis, according to the New York Times. The former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and one of the keynote speakers at the historic March on Washington before the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis spent his life advocating for the rights of minorities. He served in Congress for 33 years. President Trump on Friday tweeted condolences for the late Lewis and called him a \"civil rights hero.\" Lewis was no fan of Trump. He sparked a boycott of his inauguration in 2017 and said the president-elect was not a \"legitimate president.\" Lewis said Russians destroyed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and helped Trump win the election. During his lifetime, Lewis joked about being mistaken for Cummings in the past. In an official statement in April 2019, Lewis announced plans to grow a beard \u201cafter years of \u2018baldist\u2019 press reports that have confused the two famously clean shaven, African-American members of Congress.\u201d \u201cPeople stop me all the time and tell me they\u2019re from Maryland,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019m John Lewis, from Georgia. Rep. Cummings is a good friend of mine, but we\u2019re not the same person.\u00a0I considered getting a tattoo on the back of my head, just to clear things up.\u00a0 I tried to convince Elijah to get one too, but that didn\u2019t go over so well.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI guess being mistaken does have its advantages, though,\u201d Lewis continued.\u00a0\u201cElijah\u2019s younger than me, so I guess being mistaken for him is kind of a compliment. Maybe one day when I have a schedule conflict, I\u2019ll see if he wouldn\u2019t mind sitting in a hearing for me. \u00a0You think anybody would notice?\u201d Fox News\u2019 Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.",

In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, police reform also emerged as an issue. Omar runs\u00a0Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District \u2013 which covers much of\u00a0the city of Minneapolis\u00a0-- seen as the ground for nationwide protests sparked by Floyd's death in police custody on May 25. Omar supported\u00a0a push by a majority of the Minneapolis City Council to replace the city\u2019s police department with something new. Melton-Meaux did not support that but did support shifting some funding away from police to more social service-oriented programs. Tlaib -- another member of the four-person squad --\u00a0won her primary election in Detroit last Wednesday and proclaimed that her win\u00a0showed that the progressive lawmakers\u00a0are coming back to\u00a0Congress\u00a0stronger and bigger. She tweeted \"Our squad is big!\" after the victory on Tuesday by Omar. TLAIB WINS MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, DECLARES SQUAD 'HERE TO STAY, AND IT'S ONLY GETTING BIGGER' She outraised and beat\u00a0Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones in the 13th District primary by a two-to-one margin, which was seen as another shot in the arm for the progressive left-wing of the Democratic Party that has been taking on establishment figures.\u00a0Cori Bush, a Black Lives Matter activist also defeated Rep. William Lacy Clay -- a longtime St. Louis-area congressman -- in Missouri's Democratic primary on Aug 4. \"Let it be known that in the 13th District, just like in communities across our country, we are done with establishment politics that put corporations first,\" Tlaib said in a victory statement. \"If I was considered the most vulnerable member of the Squad, I think it\u2019s safe to say the Squad is here to stay, and it\u2019s only getting bigger.\" U.S. Rep.

OCASIO-CORTEZ TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER PRIMARY BLOWOUT: 'THEIR MONEY COULDN'T BUY A MOVEMENT' After winning, Ocasio-Cortez said the victory\u00a0proves the far-left movement she leads in New York and nationally is \"a mandate.\" \"When I won in 2018, many dismissed our victory as a 'fluke,'\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on June 23. \"Our win was treated as an aberration, or bc my opponent 'didn\u2019t try.'\u00a0So from the start, tonight\u2019s race was important to me.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is expressing support for Democratic-proposed legislation introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.,\u00a0to commission a study on reparations to African-Americans. \u201cWe recognize and support your legislation as a concrete first step to guide the actions of both federal and local leaders who have promised to do better by our Black residents,\u201d Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville and president of the Conference of Mayors, wrote in a letter dated July 10. The conference represents more than\u00a01,400 U.S. cities with populations of greater than 30,000. The call for reparations to the nation\u2019s 41 million Black Americans has renewed amid racial injustice protests across the country. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has not fully committed reparations but has expressed support for a study on the matter. Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, recently told Fox News he supported the idea of paying $14 trillion in reparations to African-Americans. ROBERT JOHNSON'S BIG IDEA: $14T IN SLAVERY REPARATIONS TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS \"Nobody talks about cash, but Black people understand cash,\" Johnson told Fox News. Under his proposal, an estimated 40 million African-Americans would get $350,000 in direct cash payments over 30 years (costing the average taxpayer roughly $2,900 a year, according to his office). The $350,000 would signify the wealth disparity between African-Americans and white Americans. The idea is deeply controversial. Some Democratic lawmakers have warmed to the discussion, but often in the form of commissions and other partial measures. A Fox News poll last year found most Americans are opposed to cash reparations. And with the government already spending trillions on coronavirus relief and the national debt pushing past $26 trillion, concerns about the country's fiscal stability would pose an obvious hurdle. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last year\u00a0said of the idea: \"I think we're always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that, and I don't think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it.\" Another study from three college professors on the extreme end of estimates\u00a0has put the price tag of adequate reparations at $6.2 quadrillion, a payment of $151 million to every Black American. CORY BOOKER INTRODUCES SENATE BILL ON REPARATIONS The study, \"Wealth Implications of Slavery and Racial Discrimination for African American Descendants of the Enslaved,\u201d determined\u00a0the price tag essentially by calculating the unpaid hours that slaves worked and the cost of discrimination the descendants of slaves faced and adds interest. When Booker announced his bill last year to study the possibility of reparations he said it was \u201ca way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy, and implicit racial bias in our country. It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed.\u201d Jackson Lee introduced a companion bill in the House, which if passed into law would set up a commission to study the impact of slavery and continued discrimination against black Americans and make recommendations on reparation proposals for the descendants of slaves.

Sign up\u00a0here.**On the roster: Populists left and right seek social media control -\u00a0Scott unveils bill to curb police brutality - Fauci pleads for caution as death toll rises - Trump offers donors $1.2 million convention package -\u00a0Somebody call ShrekPOPULISTS LEFT AND RIGHT SEEK SOCIAL MEDIA CONTROLThe progressive populists on the left and the nationalist populists on the right are in a state of high alarm over the way tech companies do business.This is one of the main proving grounds for the direction and durability of the bipolar populist movement that emerged out of the Panic of 2008 and subsequent recession.It was technology, particularly social media, which in large part facilitated the movement\u2019s success against the broad, bipartisan establishment. Now, as the movement is solidifying into an establishment of its own, leaders from both ends of the spectrum are looking to fence in the horses they rode to power.At the progressive pole, Facebook is the preferred target. Some Democrats, who partly blame the social media giant for their 2016 defeat,\u00a0are furious\u00a0because the company does not do more to limit what people can say on its platform.At the nationalist pole, Twitter is the preferred target. Some Republicans, including the president, are outraged because\u00a0they believe\u00a0the company is unfairly limiting their speech.While they may disagree about what speech these corporations should or shouldn\u2019t allow, they agree on how to punish them for their perceived abuses.The threat from Sen.\u00a0Josh Hawley, a rising star of the populist right, is the same as from Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a doyenne of the populist left: The companies must change their policies to match their demands or Congress will rescind legal protections the platforms currently enjoy and the federal government will start regulating social media content.Hawley\u2019s\u00a0latest bill, released today, would create a new system for social media users to sue the companies for claims of bias. It joins his other proposals that would, among other things, try to\u00a0limit the time\u00a0users spend on social media and\u00a0establish federal oversight\u00a0of content.That matches the approach of the Ocasio-Cortez group in the House. Democrats are\u00a0warning Facebook\u00a0that if the company does not establish content standards that meet their demands, lawmakers will roll back protections that let the companies administrate users\u2019 posts and set standards without being held liable for posts.You can\u2019t sue Twitter if someone uses the platform to defame you. You have to sue the user. But you\u00a0can\u00a0sue the New York Times for libel over an article it publishes by someone else. The threat from both Ocasio-Cortez and Hawley factions\u2019 is to let users sue social media companies for content posted on their platforms, effectively wrecking their business models.The nationalist and the progressive populists are also in sync on the threat of federal action against tech companies\u2019 business practices. As the Trump Justice Department is exploring anti-trust action to break up big tech firms, Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0is coming after the companies for targeting users with ads suggested by their profiles.There are efforts on the left and right to rein in Google and Amazon, too, but it is social media where the fight is the most urgent, and that stands to reason.It\u2019s unlikely that the nationalist populist revolt that put\u00a0President Trump\u00a0in the White House could have ever gotten off the ground without social media. Imagine\u00a0what Pat Buchanan\u00a0could have done in 1992 with a Twitter pitchfork brigade.Similarly, there would have been no\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0democratic socialist wave for Ocasio-Cortez to surf without social media and online fundraising. Their message has been the same for 50 years, but they have tools\u00a0Eugene McCarthy\u00a0and his crew did not.Team Nationalist and Team Progressive are understandably alarmed that their preferred vehicles to obtain power are in the hands of private companies.Corporations are designed to produce profits for shareholders, not facilitate political movements. And as the companies mature alongside the movements they have helped facilitate, shareholders may seek paths that reduce the populists\u2019 advantages.For now, the threats seem mostly like political theater. There\u2019s no chance of this Congress taking action as sweeping as Hawley and Ocasio-Cortez imagine. There are enough free-speech liberals and free-market conservatives to prevent that.But it is easy to see how through this election year and in the Congress that follows, this could be a place where populists left and right will seek to establish a new power structure with themselves at the center of it.THE RULEBOOK: ONE WOULD THINK\u201cIs it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 6TIME OUT: THE MIRACLE OF THE SUPERMARKETThe Atlantic: \u201cLong-suffering as one of the thinnest-margined businesses in existence and one of the least-looked-forward-to places to visit, the supermarket has, for more than a decade, been under assault from e\u2011commerce giants, blamed for making Americans fat, accused of contributing to climate change, abandoned in favor of restaurants, and, in parts of the country, disappearing at a concerning pace. \u2026 Yet in recent months, the supermarket has assumed a new centrality in Americans\u2019 lives. Cashiers, stockers, distributors, wholesalers, packers, pickers, and truck drivers have, even in the absence of adequate health safeguards, continued working to ensure that shelves stay stocked. Foodtowns, Nugget Markets, and Piggly Wigglys have emerged as crucial lifelines, spawning a broad reappreciation for one of the most distinctly American institutions.

Sen.\u00a0Tim Scott, the lone African-American GOP senator, spearheaded the legislation in the wake of\u00a0George Floyd's death and nationwide protests demanding racial justice -- including activists' calls to dismantle police departments. He framed the legislation as a bridge between law enforcement and communities of color. \u2018The answer to the question of which side do you support is \u2018I support America,\u2019\u2019 Scott, R-S.C. said, \u2018And if you support America you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority. If you support America, that means you know that the overwhelming number of officers in this nation want to do their job, go home to their family. It is not a binary choice. This legislation encompasses that spirit.\u2019 Scott said the overwhelming number of officers in America are good people. But he acknowledged the real fears people of color have about encountering the police.\u201dPoll shows huge support for protests, concerns over racism -\u00a0Quinnipiac University: \u201cWith the United States at a moment of racial reckoning, voters say 68 - 27 percent that discrimination against black people in the United States is a serious problem, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. There are wide gaps by party, as 96 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents say discrimination against black people is a serious problem, while only 34 percent of Republicans say that. Broken down by race, 95 percent of black voters, 76 percent of Hispanic voters, and 62 percent of white voters say discrimination against black people is a serious problem. \u2026 Voters support the protests 67 - 28 percent. \u2026 More than half of voters, 57 percent, have a favorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement, while 30 percent have an unfavorable one. Voters think 55 - 38 percent that protests around the country calling to end racial inequality will lead to meaningful reforms.\u201dFAUCI PLEADS FOR CAUTION AS DEATH TOLL RISESWSJ: \u201cAnthony Fauci, the U.S. government\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, warned the nation risks a resurgence of coronavirus infections should states fail to remain vigilant as they reopen their economies. \u2018When I look at the TV and I see pictures of people congregating at bars when the location they are indicates they shouldn\u2019t be doing that, that\u2019s very risky,\u2019 Dr. Fauci said in an interview Tuesday. \u2018People keep talking about a second wave,\u2019 he added. \u2018We\u2019re still in a first wave.\u2019 \u2026 With coronavirus infections increasing rapidly in a number of states, Dr. Fauci said a relaxed approach to public-health measures that reduce risk and spread poses significant hurdles to state and federal efforts. Throngs of people have gathered in many parts of the country, often without social distancing or mask wearing, prompting new warnings from state leaders of a return to shutdowns or possible punitive actions.\u201dCuomo under increasing scrutiny for nursing home deaths -\u00a0ProPublica: \u201cOn April 3,\u00a0Stephanie Gilmore, a 34-year-old nurse working at the Diamond Hill nursing home in Troy, New York, was summoned to a supervisor\u2019s office. The home\u2019s administrator and nursing director were there to relay some distressing news. Gilmore said they told her that a resident in the home had recently gone to the hospital, where she tested positive for COVID-19. The resident was set to return to Diamond Hill, making her the first confirmed COVID-19 case at the 120-bed facility north of Albany. The risks to the home\u2019s staff and other residents were obvious: The virus was ravaging nursing homes across the country. But the week before, New York Gov.\u00a0Andrew Cuomo\u00a0and his health commissioner,\u00a0Howard Zucker, had all but made such discharges mandatory. If a hospital determined a patient who needed nursing home care was medically stable, the home had to accept them, even if they had been treated for COVID-19. Moreover, the nursing home could not test any such prospective residents \u2014 those treated for COVID-19 or those hospitalized for other reasons \u2014 to see if they were newly infected or perhaps still contagious despite their treatment. It was all laid out in a formal order, effective March 25. New York was the only state in the nation that barred testing of those being placed or returning to nursing homes.\u201dStates look to Colorado as guide for safe reopening -\u00a0Politico: \u201cColorado was the first Democratic-run state to reopen from a coronavirus lockdown, and so far it has avoided the fresh spikes in infection rippling across the West. Its measured approach could be a lesson for the country on how to reopen effectively. Colorado Gov.\u00a0Jared Polis\u00a0stood out because he embarked on a slow and methodical economic recovery in late April \u2014 even before the White House\u2019s stay-at-home guidelines expired. Polis limited when restaurants and other businesses could reopen, at first only allowing curbside pickups at stores, imposing strict social distancing on salons and other personal services and prohibiting gatherings over 10 people. Colorado also benefited from a relatively young, healthy, active population that bought into the state public health officials\u2019 message about wearing masks and social distancing. That experience could influence other states as localized outbreaks pop up even as people clamor for a more rapid reopening of the economy and something resembling a more normal way of life.\u201dJason Gay: \u2018If there\u2019s no baseball, will you miss it?\u2019 -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cThis is what the past couple of months have taught us: Humans evolve. We miss our rituals and past behaviors \u2013 but we adjust. I have not worn nice pants since the Super Bowl. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve become the\u00a0Steve McQueen\u00a0of Drawstring Sweatpants. I rotate the same three T-shirts. I will probably never go back to personal sartorial dignity. \u2026 This is what baseball needs to know. The creaky old pastime is fighting again, yowling about how there might not be a 2020 season, how the billionaire owners and millionaire players can\u2019t come to terms on a deal to play a pandemic-shortened season. It wants us to yowl, too \u2013 demand that all parties come to the table and hash this dispute out. It wants us to get very, very, angry, and act like this is very, very important and very, very essential. But the danger isn\u2019t public anger. It\u2019s ambivalence. It\u2019s whether there are enough people who care enough to care.\u201dTRUMP WOOS DONORS WITH $1.2 M CONVENTION TRIPBloomberg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is enticing big-spending donors to the Republican Party\u2019s convention in August by offering packages that cost almost $1.2 million dollars per couple. Trump Victory, the joint effort of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, sent out invitations Tuesday with details of the perks available at the convention in Jacksonville, Florida, from Aug. 24-27. The invitations, obtained by Bloomberg News, offer various tiers of support, all with different levels of access to Trump as well as RNC and campaign officials. The offers rise by increments to a maximum of $1,161,200 per couple for the \u2018Presidential Trust\u2019 package, which guarantees premier access to the convention arena, with \u2018special Trump Victory hospitality,\u2019 including lounge benefits, priority seating and a behind-the-scenes tour. There is also a \u2018Vice Presidential Trust\u2019 for $580,600.\u201dBiden keeps up torrid fundraising pace -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cJoe Biden hauled in a record amount at a virtual fundraiser on Monday evening with the help of former Democratic presidential primary rival Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren. Biden\u2019s campaign said the that the former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee raised $6 million from 620 donors attending the online fundraiser. That\u2019s the largest haul to date for the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising operation set up jointly by the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee in late April. Biden praised Warren, adding, \u2018Thank you for asking your friends to help me out. It's the biggest fundraiser we've ever had. And it's all because of you. Thank you.\u2019 The event was hosted by Warren as well as retired software entrepreneur\u00a0Paul Egerman\u00a0and National Center for Learning Disabilities board member\u00a0Shanti Fry. Soon after the conclusion of Monday\u2019s fundraiser, the campaign announced that Biden will team up with his boss for eight years \u2013 former President Obama \u2013 for a virtual fundraiser next week.\u00a0 The June 23 event is Obama\u2019s fundraising debut for his former vice president and will target small-dollar donors.\u201dScaramucci and other GOPers launch pro-Biden super PAC -\u00a0Axios: \u201cA group of prominent Republican operatives that includes former officials from the Trump and\u00a0George W. Bush\u00a0administrations are launching a super PAC to turn out GOP voters for Joe Biden in November, organizers tell Axios. The \u2018Right Side PAC\u2019 aims to identify former Trump supporters across the country who have cooled to the president's approach in office and convince them to vote for Biden, says founder Matt Borges, a former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party.\u00a0Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired after 10 days as Trump's communications director and later turned on the president, also is part of the effort. The PAC will initially target voters in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida. They'll use digital, mail and telephone to reach voters. They'll encourage absentee voting. They do not have plans to run TV ads.\u201dJudge denies Oklahomans\u2019 efforts to block Trump's rally -\u00a0SF Gate: \u201cA Tulsa judge on Tuesday denied an effort by city residents and business owners to block President Donald Trump from holding an indoor campaign rally this weekend that some fear could further the spread of the coronavirus. The lawsuit in the district court of Tulsa County sought a temporary injunction against the company that manages the 19,000-seat venue, the BOK Center, \u2018to protect against a substantial, imminent, and deadly risk to the community,\u2019 according to a copy of the complaint. Judge\u00a0Rebecca Nightingale\u00a0denied the request. There have been mounting concerns among Democrats, civil rights activists, and even some Republicans that Trump's rally could inflame racial tensions in Tulsa and contribute to further spreading of the coronavirus. Some opponents plan to protest Trump's presence. At the same time, Trump's supporters eagerly awaited Saturday night's gathering, already lining up four days ahead of time.\u201dETHICS COMMITTEE CLEARS LOEFFLER ON STOCK SALESPolitico: \u201cThe Senate Ethics Committee has ended its investigation into Sen.\u00a0Kelly Loeffler\u2019s stock trades, according to a letter sent Tuesday to the Georgia Republican. The news comes three weeks after Loeffler\u2019s office said the Justice Department had also dropped its probe into her stock trades.\u00a0Deborah Sue Mayer, the Ethics Committee\u2019s chief counsel and staff director, wrote in the letter that the panel examined stock transactions made by both Loeffler and her husband Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. \u2018Based on all the information before it, the Committee did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules or standards of conduct,\u2019 Mayer said. \u2018Accordingly, consistent with its precedent, the Committee has dismissed the matter.\u2019 It\u2019s a welcome development for Loeffler, though significant political damage has already been done as she seeks to stay in the Senate past November.\u201dDems settle on challenger in key Atlanta suburb race\u00a0-\u00a0Roll Call: \u201cPublic policy professor\u00a0Carolyn Bourdeaux\u00a0was declared the outright winner Tuesday of a crowded Democratic primary in suburban Atlanta, as absentee ballots continued to be counted a week after the chaotic June 9 elections. Bourdeaux had 52.7 percent of the vote in Georgia\u2019s 7th District in tallies posted Tuesday afternoon, when The Associated Press called the race. \u2026 Bourdeaux was below that level last week, when the AP said she would face a runoff with Rep.\u00a0Brenda Lopez Romero, who had 12.4 percent. Progressive activist\u00a0Nabilah Islam\u00a0was a close third in the six-candidate field, with 12.3 percent. Bourdeaux was the 2018 Democratic nominee and unexpectedly came within 1 percentage point of beating GOP Rep.\u00a0Rob Woodall. Woodall was one of the first House members to announce his retirement this cycle.\u201dDems dump Sasse challenger over raunchy texts to staff -\u00a0NYT: \u201cThe Nebraska Democratic Party has withdrawn its support for its Senate candidate,\u00a0Chris Janicek, after he made sexually explicit comments about one of his campaign staff members in a group text that included her. The party said in a statement on Tuesday that it had received a copy of the text messages last week, and that party leaders had met with Mr. Janicek on Thursday and urged him to drop out of the race. On Monday, Mr. Janicek refused to do so, and the party\u2019s executive committee voted unanimously to withdraw its support and resources from his campaign. \u2018Our Democratic Party has no tolerance for sexual harassment,\u2019\u00a0Jane Kleeb, the chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said in the statement. \u2018Our party will not extend resources or any type of support to any candidate that violates our code of conduct and doesn\u2019t treat men and women with the dignity and respect they deserve.\u2019\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYPergram: Debate about offensive symbols, icons on Capitol Hill sprawls far beyond the Confederates\u00a0-\u00a0Fox NewsIowa Gov.\u00a0Kim Reynolds\u00a0to restore paroled felons\u2019 voting rights\u00a0-\u00a0NYTAUDIBLE: BOOM.

I can\u2019t imagine any running mate saving McCain or\u00a0Walter Mondale. Biden\u2019s pledge to pick a female running mate was not about the general election, anyway. It was aimed at wrapping up the nomination of a party that was deeply frustrated by the failures of what at first seemed a promising crop of female contenders. Biden\u2019s promise was aimed at women holding out for\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0and\u00a0Amy Klobuchar. Democratic voters are majority female and these considerations, especially following Hillary Clinton\u2019s Hindenburg act, are a big deal. As for the general, I don\u2019t think gender matters nearly as much as you or they seem to think. I think what will matter for Biden are the qualities and capabilities of the woman he chooses. If Biden picks someone smart, capable and politically astute, she will be an asset. If he picks an unqualified goofball, it might do in his candidacy.

Local news outlets report that hundreds of demonstrators against and for President Trump\u00a0were present as they planned to watch the state-by-state results of the 2020 election. Black Lives Matter Plaza is near the White House. There were reports of a small skirmish earlier on Tuesday evening, which allegedly broke out after protesters did not comply with orders to move a vehicle that was illegally parked. There are some reports that two\u00a0arrests for alleged assault\u00a0were\u00a0made, which have not been verified by Fox News. Demonstrations could carry on past Tuesday as a winner in the presidential race may not be declared for days. Scuffles between opposing groups were seen in social media posts but there were moments of calm,\u00a0according to media reports. Some people were even seen dancing and singing. ACTIVIST GROUP PLANS WIDESPREAD, \u2018DISRUPTIVE\u2019 ELECTION ACTIVITIES TO THWART POTENTIAL TRUMP \u2018COUP\u2019 As previously reported by Fox News, a group of protesters has been holding training events for planned demonstrations on the night of the election\u00a0\u2013 specifically around scenarios where President Trump refuses to concede should he lose the election. Shutdown D.C., which characterizes its planned movement as an \"uprising,\" called for potentially blockading the White House, blocking traffic, shutting down government office buildings and even Amazon fulfillment centers. Action that is encouraged by the group includes boycotts, strikes, slowdowns \u2013 and refusal to \u201cpurposefully avoid tension with authorities.\u201d Responding to Fox News, the FBI said its standard practice is to neither confirm nor deny an investigation.

The intelligence community warned in August\u00a0that\u00a0rival nations once again are attempting to influence U.S. policy and elections in a variety of ways, declaring that Iran wants to \"undermine\"\u00a0President Trump while\u00a0Russia is working to \"primarily denigrate\"\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden. Congressional Democrats claim the Trump administration has \"sought to promote a false narrative of equivalence among the interests of several nations in U.S. elections and policy,\" by lumping China, Russia and Iran together. \"The\u00a0aims and actions of Russia, China and Iran are not the same,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement Saturday.\u00a0\"Only one country \u2013 Russia \u2013 is actively undertaking a range of measures to undermine the presidential election and to secure the outcome that the Kremlin sees as best serving its interests.\" Twitter pulled down an account purporting to be a young Black man who withdrew support from Black Lives Matter\u00a0and threw it behind \"Republicans\"\u00a0\u2013 one of his posts got 40,000\u00a0likes in under 24 hours.

This is where any ongoing conversation usually comes to a screeching halt. BIDEN-HARRIS NOT OFFERING SOLUTIONS TO STOP RISING VIOLENCE IN DEM-RUN CITIES: FORMER NYPD LIEUTENANT Why is that? People with different beliefs often struggle to communicate in a way that builds empathy and connection. Even with the best of intentions, all it takes is one wrong turn\u2014one moment that evokes a strong emotion like anger, fear, shame, or anxiety\u2014to derail the conversation. Instead of responding with words that lead to greater understanding, we lash out, dismiss, ridicule, \u2018block\u2019 the other person, and so on. How can we better engage with those who stand \u201cacross the divide?\u201d With the final stretch of the 2020 presidential campaign\u00a0just around the corner and a huge schism between the two sides, we believe that as impossible as it may seem, it is possible. There can be no positive change without first understanding each other to find common ground. We all want basic safety and security. We all want freedom. We all want to be understood and to be treated kindly. As an affect-based psychotherapist and a language strategist who consults on persuasion, we believe that the answer lies in an understanding of emotions. Emotions are automatic responses that in a flash transform the mind and body from calm, open, and connected states of being to anxious, agitated, and disconnected states. In triggered moments, the intention to stay calm and connected while discussing a difficult subject seamlessly devolves into anger, blame, or withdrawal. To transcend these moments, we need strategies to override our reactive impulses. Here are a few such strategies: First, recognize that all political conversations are emotional conversations. When we enter into these conversations, we intend to defend our beliefs with nothing but logic, reason, and facts. In reality, there is no separating logic, reason, or even fact from emotion when it comes to politics. And that is true on both sides. Our beliefs become part of our identity originating from the personal experiences with our families and peers and compounded by the clickbait culture we are living in. Take the debate to defund the police. We\u2019ve seen African American BLM activists get choked up with anger and fear as they recall their own traumatic encounters with the police. We\u2019ve also seen people on the other side of the debate shake with the same anger and fear as they recall being victims of a violent crime in which the police were their only recourse. Both kinds of people are in the throes of a deeply emotional experience\u2014and that\u2019s OK. Our emotional experience belongs within an ideological debate just as much as facts do\u2014but it needs to be acknowledged as such, and then channeled productively. This is especially true of anger, which can so easily send our good intentions right out the window. Again, psychologists and neurologists know this to be true: when strong emotions like rage are triggered, the logical part of our brain, the prefrontal cortex, shuts off in favor of the limbic system, the emotion center. We literally lose the ability to think and respond rationally when we are very angry. Thus, even saying something as simple as \u201cI feel myself getting angry\u201d can preemptively defuse a heated moment and save the broader conversation. That\u2019s the power of self-awareness that we must bring to these discussions if we want them to succeed. Ultimately, it\u2019s a balancing act between validating your own and the other person\u2019s emotions and knowing when they\u2019ve got too tight a grip and you need to take a break before continuing to engage. If neither side is able to validate the emotions of the other\u2014and, just as importantly, identify and process their own emotional response before jumping to a defensive or offensive retort\u2014understanding and connection cannot take place. Second, when you feel yourself getting angry, return to a place of curiosity. Another way to engage in a more productive dialogue is to change your objective: instead of trying to be right, make your goal to learn about the other person. Don\u2019t assume that you know what a hot-button term means to the individual who uses it. Don\u2019t assume you know why they believe what they do. Don\u2019t assume they are good or bad. Don\u2019t assume anything. Instead, ask follow-up questions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Whenever you feel yourself getting upset, you can always return to this place of curiosity. Staying curious keeps you from getting emotionally triggered by keeping your prefrontal cortex (the logical part of your brain) activated. Instead of receding into anger you\u2019ll be more likely to have a fruitful discussion. Finally, validate the other person\u2019s concerns. One thing we hear over and over again in our different practices is clients saying to us, \u201cif they only knew XYZ, then they would understand.\u201d So, after you\u2019ve posed a follow-up question to the other person, demonstrate that you understand their answer. It especially helps if you can recount their answer back to them in different words. It also helps to add affirmations like \u201cI really hear you\u201d and \u201cthat would upset me too.\u201d Importantly, telling someone that you hear and understand their concerns doesn\u2019t mean that you are endorsing their beliefs. It just shows that you\u2019re willing to put yourself in their shoes and recognize your shared humanity, which is the bridge to connection and solving problems constructively together. Below is an example of how all these tips can be used in action. This is how a conversation about wearing a mask between two friends (who have very different beliefs on the subject) might begin: Joe: I can\u2019t believe that after all this time and with the numbers going up that people refuse to wear a mask.\u00a0 What is wrong with everyone?\u00a0 It\u2019s selfish and reckless.\u00a0 I have to be honest, I\u2019m really upset that you are out here without a mask.\u00a0Why? Paul: I\u2019m just not convinced a flimsy cotton mask is going to work.\u00a0 And they keep on changing their mind about masks. I can be safe in my own way.\u00a0 If I am healthy, have no symptoms and am staying isolated, why do I need to wear a mask? Joe:\u00a0 I hear you have doubts and that makes sense. We know they aren\u2019t perfect.\u00a0 But, it\u2019s one simple thing that people can do to slow the spread. I also hear you are healthy which is wonderful. But did you know that people can feel healthy and still be contagious? Are you saying you don\u2019t care if you sicken someone else who could die? Paul:\u00a0Of course I care about others.\u00a0 But I think the risk is very low if I\u2019m careful and I definitely don\u2019t want the government to tell me what to do. Joe: I\u2019m glad that we agree that we don\u2019t want to hurt others with our actions. And, I get it.\u00a0I don\u2019t like people telling me what to do either. But I am curious, not judging, about what is the downside of wearing a mask in a store?\u00a0I'd rather we do it and slow the spread without being forced into it. If we don\u2019t find ways to slow the spread, I am sure that even more regulations will get passed. Paul: I guess I would rather wear a mask than have the government mandate it - and even worse, shut us down entirely.\u00a0 I have to be honest though, I really hate how judgmental people have gotten and how political masks are. I think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than people think it is.\u00a0Not wearing a mask doesn\u2019t mean that people are ignorant or selfish.\u00a0 People have their reasons, especially when they are outside at a safe distance from others. Joe: I hear you and I never thought you were ignorant or a bad person. I can see how you see it now.\u00a0 Even though I hate that we have to do it too, I wish everyone would wear a mask inside and socially distance so we could get the numbers down, be able to trace infections, and get rid of this virus so life can go back to normal. Paul: I wish that too, Joe. Notice how both Joe and Paul ask questions of each other, even when it doesn\u2019t seem necessary.

Months before Louisville and other major U.S. cities contended with renewed demonstrations following the grand jury ruling in\u00a0the death of Breonna Taylor, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris warned that nationwide protests against racial injustice were \u201cnot going to stop\u201d after Election Day. Sen. Harris\u2019 remarks came during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d on June 17. At the time, nationwide protests were underway following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis police custody. BREONNA TAYLOR CASE: WHAT IS WANTON ENDANGERMENT? \u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d Harris said at the time. \u201cThis is a movement, I\u2019m telling you. They\u2019re not going to stop and everyone beware, because they\u2019re not going to stop. They\u2019re not going to stop before Election Day in November and they\u2019re not going to stop after Election Day. Everyone should take note of that on both levels. They\u2019re not going to let up and they should not and we should not.\u201d Harris\u2019s appearance on the show occurred roughly about two months before Democratic nominee Joe Biden picked her to be his running mate. The security of U.S. cities amid protests that have occasionally turned violent in recent months has emerged as a key issue in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. Harris told Colbert that she felt it was \u201ccritically important\u201d for protests to continue in order to achieve necessary social and political reform. 127 ARRESTED IN BREONNA TAYLOR PROTESTS \u201cThe only way we are going to truly achieve change is when there are people in the system who are willing or pushing to do it and when there are those of us who are outside the system demanding it,\u201d she added at the time. \u201cI am very clear that some of the success we have been able to achieve around criminal justice reform would not have happened in recent years without Black Lives Matter.\u201d Protests erupted Wednesday night following a Kentucky grand jury\u2019s decision not to prosecute the officers involved in the death of Taylor, a Black woman, during a botched police operation at her apartment on March 13. Two Louisville police officers were shot during protests against the grand jury\u2019s decision.

            "article_content": " EXCLUSIVE: Less than two months ahead of the\u00a0presidential\u00a0election \u2013 with concerns of foreign interference again at the forefront\u00a0\u2013 a conservative political group\u00a0is raising \"serious concerns\" about millions of donations reported\u00a0by a major Democratic fundraising platform. A\u00a0 preliminary computer\u00a0analysis by the Take Back Action Fund, obtained exclusively by Fox News, has found that nearly half of all 2019\u00a0donations to ActBlue were made by people claiming to be unemployed. Action Fund President John Pudner questioned the veracity of those donations and called it a loophole that must be closed for the sake of election integrity. \"After downloading hundreds of millions of [dollars in] donations to the Take Back Action Fund servers, we were shocked to see that almost half of the donations to ActBlue in 2019 claimed to be unemployed individuals,\" he said. \"The name of employers must be disclosed when making\u00a0political\u00a0donations, but more than 4.7 million donations came from people who claimed they did not have an employer. Those 4.7 million donations totaled $346 million ActBlue raised and sent to liberal causes.\" The trend is continuing this year:\u00a0An Action Fund examination of 2020 data from January through August showed\u00a0an uptick in \"unemployed\" donations through\u00a0ActBlue, to 50.1% this year. ActBlue defends\u00a0the integrity of its\u00a0donations and said many\u00a0come from retirees and people who aren't counted as\u00a0employed, such as homemakers. According to the findings of the Action Fund \u2013 a nonprofit that aims\u00a0to \"educate the public on conservative solutions for political reform\" \u2013\u00a048.4% of ActBlue donations last year, prior to the massive loss of jobs that came with the onslaught of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, came from those who did not list an employer or who claimed\u00a0to be unemployed. Pudner said the large number is a red flag that some donations may be illicit contributions from foreign\u00a0interests attempting to\u00a0impact U.S. elections. \"It is hard to believe that at a time when the U.S. unemployment rate was less than 4 percent, that unemployed people had $346 million dollars to send to ActBlue for liberal causes,\" Pudner said, adding that \"4.7 million donations from people without a job ... raised serious concerns.\" REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS ON MUELLER TEAM WIPING PHONES, SUGGEST 'ANTICIPATORY OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE' ActBlue, created in 2004, bills itself as a \"powerful online fundraising platform available to\u00a0Democratic\u00a0candidates and committees, progressive organizations,\u00a0and nonprofits that share our values for no cost besides a 3.95%\u00a0processing fee\u00a0on donations.\" \"And we operate as a conduit, which means donations made through ActBlue to a campaign or organization are considered individual donations,\" its website explains. But critics, including\u00a0the Action Fund, contend that the website allows credit card donations that are not verified, so anyone from any country in the world can donate without a paper trail. \"ActBlue's insistence on refusing to allow banks to verify their donations is an invitation to foreign programmers or others to send money through them using fake American names, and we encourage them to start letting banks verify the identity of donors to stop the potential for millions of dollars to influence our election,\" Pudner said. Last year, the\u00a0Republican\u00a0Party created a competing fundraising platform called\u00a0WinRed to counter\u00a0ActBlue's prowess in small-donor sourcing. According to the Action Fund, an analysis of WinRed's 4.9\u00a0million donations totalling $302 million\u00a0found that only 4%\u00a0came from people who did not list an employer or were unemployed. This year,\u00a0the rate is\u00a05.6%, according to the data. 2019 data compiled by Take Back Action Fund (Take Back Action Fund) \"We purposely wanted to examine 2019 first, because, before COVID-19, the unemployment rate was at 4 percent or below. It's hard to believe that millions of Americans who were out of work had $346 million to spare to give to ActBlue for liberal causes,\" Pudner said. RUSSIA TARGETING BLACK LIVES MATTER, LEFT-LEANING VOTERS ONLINE: INTELLIGENCE SOURCES Precisely determining if the donations were authentic and genuinely from those who were unemployed requires further time and resources, he said. \"Auditing these suspect donations to determine if millions lied by indicating they were unemployed when in fact they were not, or if their names were just being used by a foreign programmer or someone else to move money without their knowledge, will take time,\" Pudner said. \"We've planned a series of forensic procedures to identify whether or not these donors of record exist or not, if they made the contributions themselves, and whether they were legally able, and whether or not they are potential 'straw' donors, making the contributions after being given the money and direction by someone else.\" Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden departs after speaking at a campaign event on manufacturing American products at UAW Region 1 headquarters in Warren, Mich., Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) In response to questions by Fox News, a\u00a0representative for ActBlue said\u00a0\"it is best security practice to refrain from publicly sharing any detailed information about how we analyze contributions.\" \"But we use an array of data sources, internal validation\u00a0and third-party services to verify the validity of transactions. We take the security of our platform and integrity of donations very seriously,\" the spokesperson said. \"We report every contribution to federal candidates that comes through our platform, and you can look those up on the FEC. We report the information donors enter about their occupation and employer, and we do see a significant portion of donors who report their status as not employed, such as retired donors or full-time parents.\" The issue of unauthenticated political donations was also brought to light by The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0in 2008, which was at the time \"allowing donors to use largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity.\" In 2015, the Action Fund said\u00a0millions of dollars \"could be moved by allowing unverified credit card contributions,\" and Pudner said\u00a0that even today, ActBlue continues to use such an \"unverified system.\" \"We found it took other vendors only a matter of hours to switch their system to allow verification of donations and thus prevent the possibility of illegal foreign money being moved into campaigns,\" Pudner said. \"Choosing to use an untraceable system has a higher cost in terms of the risk of credit card fraud and also tends to incur higher bank fees. And this untraceable system allows someone with a gift card to make donations in anyone's name, even if that person never actually made that donation, or even if that person doesn't exist at all.\" FILE- In this Sept. 17, 2019, file photo, President Donald Trump boards Air Force One at Albuquerque International Sunport in Albuquerque, N.M.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both WinRed and\u00a0ActBlue note on their\u00a0donation pages that law requires donors\u00a0to list their\u00a0employer and occupation. \"The problem,\" Pudner said, \"is on the back end where ActBlue does not allow banks to verify the identity of the cardholder, meaning someone could buy endless gift cards and list any name they wanted and leave the employer line blank or type in words like 'not employed,' 'unemployed.'\" Data complied from January-August 2020 (Take Back Action Fund) \"With half of ActBlue donors indicating they do not have an employer, we recommend they start letting their payment processors verify donations to stop any foreign or other illicit donations by simply listing themselves as an unemployed American,\" Pudner added.",

Many of the protests were being\u00a0led by Black Lives Matter and Shutdown DC, which conducted training for months leading up to Election Day. Cities included in the effort included Washington, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle\u00a0and Portland, Ore. Other citiies seeing protests included Philadelphia and Minneapolis. In Philadelphia, two different protests converged into one, according to reports. The Count\u00a0Every Vote movement, which aims to ensure all votes are counted in the presidential election, combined with protesters calling for the termination of police officers involved in the Oct. 26 shooting death of Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man who police claimed came at officers with a knife. TRUMP SUPPORTERS PROTEST AT ARIZONA VOTING CENTER WHILE BALLOTS ARE TALLIED The two Philadelphia groups gathered in front of Independence Hall,\u00a0according to the\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer, before heading to City Hall and to Mayor Jim Kenney's home\u00a0in the Old City neighborhood, according to the newspaper. The Wallace\u00a0protesters\u00a0were seen on video chanting \"Stop killing Black people!\" outside the mayor's office. The protest came on the same day that city officials released police body-cam footage from the oficers' interaction with Wallace, as well as 911 recordings. The release was done in cooperation with members of Wallace's family, according to video posted by FOX 29 of Philadelphia. Authorities also identified the officers involved in the incident as Officer Sean Matarazzo, 25, and Officer Thomas Munz, 26, the report said. In Minneapolis, a large Count Every Vote crowd\u00a0blocked traffic on Interstate 94 at Riverside Avenue, according to video shared by\u00a0FOX 9 Minneapolis' Karen Scullin. State Patrol troopers and Minneapolis police said they\u00a0were arresting protesters. \"Walking on the freeway is illegal and very dangerous for pedestrians and motorists,\" the State Patrol wrote. \"We respect the right of everyone to express themselves under the First Amendment, but the freeway is not a place to do that.\" Scullin noted\u00a0that the\u00a0crowd, estimated to be made up of\u00a0more than 500 people, had been on I-94 for at least an hour. \"Police say they're all under arrest,\" Scullin wrote. \"Unclear what's going to happen to the 500+ people.

On Wednesday night the race in Pennsylvania between Trump and Biden remained too close to call. Trump was leading Biden,\u00a051.4% to 47.6%, The Associated Press reported Wednesday. Earlier Wednesday,\u00a0Trump\u00a0declared victory in multiple key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, even though official results remained unclear. The president asserted that continuing to count ballots in states such as Pennsylvania was an attempt to disenfranchise people who voted for him. As for Minnesota, the Fox News Decision Desk\u00a0called the race for Biden, who was leading the state with\u00a052.6% of the vote compared to Trump's 45.4%, according to estimates. In Washington, demonstrators were set to gather\u00a0around midday Wednesday either at Union Station or at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House\u00a0to \u201ckeep showing up and keep supporting each other until the people swear in the new government.\u201d \u201cThe polls have closed and record numbers of voters have cast their ballots in this election. Now it\u2019s time to make sure that every single vote is counted, so we can preserve the pillars of democracy and build the future we want to live in,\u201d the organization said on its website. Police later\u00a0said\u00a0four\u00a0people were arrested in D.C. between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning in instances related to overnight unrest.\u00a0Investigators were looking for three suspects who reportedly slashed at least four people, including\u00a0a\u00a0Proud Boys leader.

            "article_content": " A collection of groups led by Black Lives Matter and Shutdown DC reportedly\u00a0has been holding training sessions for demonstrators to protest\u00a0on Election Day\u00a0-- and apparently, they\u2019re planning a large-scale event across the street from the White House expected to draw thousands. Several leaked documents and Zoom call recordings described a loose but coordinated network of activists seeking to mobilize around the country,\u00a0especially if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden loses or if President Trump contests the election results. The materials purportedly showed plans to shut down federal buildings, including the White House, and to meet members of Congress at public transportation portals when they\u2019re scheduled to reconvene\u00a0in Washington after the election. The\u00a0apparent goal: to continue the civil unrest from Election Day until at least later this week -- and potentially until the presidential inauguration in January. Fox News could not independently\u00a0confirm the legitimacy of the recordings and documents with local and federal law enforcement.\u00a0DC Metro Police Department did not immediately return a Fox News request for comment. 'TRUMP TRAIN' IN TEXAS FOLLOWED BIDEN BUS DOWN HIGHWAY, FBI INVESTIGATING Nadine Seiler, of Waldorf, Md., center, wears a \"devil Trump\" costume while protesting against President Donald Trump, Friday, Oct. 30, 2020, on the section of 16th Street renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Responding to Fox News, the FBI said its standard practice is to neither confirm nor deny an investigation. The agency did say it has been working well in advance of Nov. 3 with federal, state\u00a0and local partners to \u201cgather and analyze intelligence to determine whether individuals might be motivated to take violent action for any reason.\u201d FBI headquarters is focusing on providing a \u201ccentralized location for assessing election-related threats, tracking status reports and significant complaints from FBI field offices, monitoring for indicators of a coordinated nationwide effort to disrupt the election process, providing guidance to FBI field offices, and coordinating an FBI response to any election-related incident.\u201d FBI field offices are standing up election command posts to coordinate with headquarters and local and state partners to streamline communication and ensure the safety of elections and the public, the agency said in a statement. According to the Shutdown DC website, thousands of people are planning to\u00a0\u201cstart this next phase of the election cycle in the streets\u201d by gathering at Black Lives Matter Plaza by 4 p.m.\u00a0Tuesday. Large screens will be set up to stream election results\u00a0as crowds are entertained by GoGo bands, salsa dancers, artists\u00a0and cultural workers,\u00a0 according to the site. \u201cVotes will still be coming in, so this will (probably) not be the time we need to create disruption to stop a coup - yet. But we\u2019ll be in a good place to respond to whatever might happen,\u201d the website claimed. \u201cThis has been a really long and dark era so we\u2019re going to be together to process our feelings of hope, anger, fear, and exhaustion as a community.\u201d DC and cities across the country brace for unrest over election results; Leland Vittert reports. A recording purportedly of one training session hosted over Zoom by the \u201cSunrise Movement\u201d featured Lisa Fithian, who has been described by Mother Jones \u201cas the nation's best-known protest consultant.\u201d In the video, Fithian showed a target map displaying all the police stations, key government buildings, media outlets\u00a0and buildings occupied by \u201cTrump boosters\u201d in the DC area. She discussed \u201cwhat would it take to surround the White House.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re facing an administration and a potential coup and a potential insurrection,\u201d Fithian said. \u201cIs there going to be a war? Are people gonna get killed? Like is that on anybody else\u2019s mind? I\u2019m guessing it is. We\u2019re going to see potential fighting all over the country or in some hotspots, and we\u2019ve already seen that, so how do we work together across the country to help support each other no matter where we are and to maximize our impact by doing similar things on similar days at similar times?\u201d 'NO CLIMB' FENCE TO BE INSTALLED AROUND WHITE HOUSE, SOURCE SAYS Fithian said demonstrators willing to break windows on government buildings should go a step farther and get inside. She told those on the call, \u201cWe have to be willing to put our bodies on the line and take on some discomfort and sacrifice risk in order to change things.\u201d \u201cWe are going to be in a crisis but we want to make sure it\u2019s one that we are creating. We want them to be responding to us and us not responding to them. In a situation of a coup or an insurrection or an uprising, whoever\u2019s got the guns, often can win. We should be clear. Trump\u2019s gotta go,\u201d she said, according to the recording of the call posted to the YouTube account\u00a0SunriseExposed. The video has since been removed from YouTube for violating community guidelines. Various activist groups allegedly coordinated via Zoom calls and at some in-person events for months ahead of Election Day for training sessions targeting anyone from the young street protesters to federal employees \u201cseeking methods of professional civil disobedience.\u201d \u201cThe police are readying for battle. We should be very clear about that,\u201d April Goggans, a core organizer with the local Black Lives Matter affiliate, said during an Oct. 26 online training session, The Associated Press reported. Neither\u00a0Fithian nor Goggans responded to\u00a0Fox News' requests for comment. Another leaked Zoom call viewed by Fox News\u00a0purportedly showed federal workers, including attorneys and members of the intelligence community, discussing ways to go past street protests and \u201cslow the gears downs\u201d through their bureaucracy should the \u201celection go sideways.\u201d\u00a0In part, they planned to stack vacation hours and sick days in order to slow down bureaucratic processes. The video showing clips from that\u00a0Zoom call remained active on YouTube as of Tuesday morning. The documents and video recordings were first obtained by Millie Weaver, founder of the investigative journalist site Millennial Millie. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Weaver said the edited clips posted to YouTube were taken from over two-hour long Zoom recordings exposing plots \"to exhaust emergency and law enforcement resources.\" She said the different names listed as participants on the Zoom calls include federal employees with high-level administrative powers\u00a0and even former State Department employees with experience related to government insurrections abroad. Some organizations leading these training sessions were founded decades ago, while others were newly formed over the summer in response to George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis at the end of May, according to the AP. Ahead of the presidential election, workers with Baguer Construction LLC board up a Walgreens on U Street NW, Friday, Oct. 30, 2020, in Washington. The site manager said they had been hired to put protective coverings on several Walgreens throughout the city. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Hope Neyer, an organizer with Shutdown DC, told the AP her group was rehearsing \u201celection meltdown simulations\u201d that include indefinitely occupying certain public spaces and rushing to intervene in attempts to intimidate voters at polling places or seize ballots. BUSINESSES ACROSS NATION BOARD UP WINDOWS AHEAD OF POTENTIAL ELECTION DAY UNREST A recent training session for demonstrators led by BLM emphasized personal safety: Enter a protest with a trusted crew of friends; always look for a safe exit route; be aware of whether you\u2019re standing on public, private\u00a0or federal land; and know your rights in each case; drink plenty of water.\u00a0One slide advised participants that if a protester is physically attacked, other demonstrators should \u201ctotally surround person being attacked and absorb them back into the crowd.\u201d Meanwhile,\u00a0low-altitude helicopter flights have been conducted\u00a0by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration over downtown Washington, D.C., in preparation for the presidential inauguration scheduled to take place on Jan. 20, 2021, to protect public safety. Businesses in the downtown DC area have also already boarded up their first- and second-story windows in anticipation of repeated rioting and looting seen over the summer.\u00a0 Activists are fearing that Facebook and Twitter might shut down and are embracing encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram to communicate during demonstrations. Nadine Bloch, an activist who founded the organization Beautiful Trouble, told the AP that she helped set up a \u201cresistance hotline\u201d for groups seeking support and believes local activists stand ready to \u201ccompletely interrupt ordinary life, if that's what we need to do.\u201d At the moment, Bloch, whose experience dates back to captaining a ship for Greenpeace in the 1990s seeking to disrupt French nuclear tests, said her training priorities are \u201cstreet smarts and street safety.\u201d She said marches are \u201ceasily ignored,\u201d while long-term occupations can be a tremendous drain on resources. She counsels groups not to waste time and energy \u201carguing about different tactics.\u201d The street event in front of the White House is planned as District of Columbia officials reportedly told Trump that a party planned for election night at his luxury Trump International Hotel in Washington could be in violation of rules limiting mass gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said he might stay at the White House or choose another venue amid the city\u2019s shutdown. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has been a vocal critic of Trump's and in June renamed a portion of the street in front of the White House \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza\u201d and had the slogan spray-painted on the asphalt amid largescale demonstrations following the death of Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The renaming came after Trump ordered federal law enforcement and the National Guard into D.C. against Bowser\u2019s wishes amid widespread looting and property damage. The president also received criticism after federal police used tear gas to forcefully clear peaceful protesters in order to allow Trump to walk from the White House to the historic St. John\u2019s Church to pose with a Bible.

            "article_content": " Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the president of the United States\u00a0-- and not slightly more popular than the president, much more popular. TRUMP TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON POLICING TO 'BUILD TRUST' IN LAW ENFORCEMENT A survey this week by Rasmussen, a right-leaning pollster, found that 62 percent of likely voters now have a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter. At the same time, Rasmussen found that Donald Trump's approval rating was 43 percent. That's almost 20 points lower. And by the way, Trump was not alone. Black Lives Matter is far more popular than Joe Biden, too. It's more popular than America's religious institutions -- all of them. It's more popular than the media, the Congress and big business. Black Lives Matter is more popular by double digits than both the Democratic and the Republican\u00a0parties. It's almost as popular as the U.S. military. It's much more popular than the pope. The numbers are astounding, but the polls are not the only measure of it. One picture from a Black Lives Matter rally over the weekend in New York shows\u00a0an ocean of people. Ask yourself the last time you saw a candidate for office who was able to draw a crowd like that? CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The media, in their relentlessly fawning coverage, usually described Black Lives Matter as an activist group or a protest movement. But that's deception by understatement. Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs. It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA. It's not pressuring Congress to pass some narrow new set of laws. Black Lives Matter is far more ambitious than that. It is working to remake the country and then to control it. It's a political party. As of now, Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful political party in the United States. Nobody says that out loud, but politicians understand it perfectly well. If nothing else, they understand power; they can smell it at great distances. And that's why they're lining up to bow before Black Lives Matter. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.: You can't really reform a department that that is rotten to the root. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.: We've heard our people cry out, \"I can't breathe!\" We've heard our people speak out,\u00a0\"Black Lives Matter.\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.:\u00a0This is a systemic problem that requires a comprehensive solution. Stacy Abrams, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate: What I would say is that there is -- there is a legitimacy to this anger. There's a legitimacy to this outrage. None of what you just saw is a stretch for Democrats. They believe their long-term goals align with those of Black Lives Matter. And in fact, at times, the group functions as an arm of the Democratic Party. More telling, though -- and more ominous --\u00a0 is the response from many Republicans. They've been happy to go along as well, or in Mitt Romney's case, even mouth the same slogans. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah: We need to end violence and brutality and to make sure that people understand that Black Lives Matter. If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors -- and they are -- then by definition, you are allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them. Black Lives Matter wants to run the country; therefore, you can freely criticize Black Lives Matter. Those are the rules of our system -- but not anymore. That was the former Republican nominee for president. Let that sink in. If there was ever an indicator of how powerful Black Lives Matter has become, you just saw it. Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is. That's why they pause before offending China. It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do. It's all pretty strange when you think about it. If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors -- and they are -- then by definition, you are allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them. Black Lives Matter wants to run the country; therefore, you can freely criticize Black Lives Matter. Those are the rules of our system -- but not anymore. Imagine a world where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president or for insulting your local mayor. You probably can't imagine that. It's too bizarre. It's un-American. But that's where we are right now. Black Lives Matter has changed the rules. And here is their first new rule: No criticizing Black Lives Matter. You can be fired from your job if you disobey. Many Americans have been. On Friday, for example, the principal of a public school in Windsor, Vermont. was dismissed from her job for posting the following words on her personal Facebook page: \"While I understand the urgency to feel compelled to advocate for black lives, what about our fellow law enforcement? Just because I don't walk around with a BLM sign should not mean I'm a racist.\". Unfortunately, the principal's boss disagreed. The superintendent of Windsor Schools described the quote you just heard as \"outright racist.\" Windsor, Vermont, by the way, is more than 97 percent white. Also on Friday, an economist called Harald Uhlig lost his job at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for daring to offer even milder criticism than that. On Twitter, Uhlig noted that Black Lives Matter had\"just torpedoed itself with its full-fledged support of #defund the police. Now is the time\u00a0for sensible adults to enter back into the room and have serious, earnest, respectful conversations about it all.\" That was a racist statement, the Federal Reserve concluded. So, they fired Harald Uhlig. We could give you many other examples of the same thing happening. There are a lot of them. Black Lives Matter now enjoys almost complete immunity from criticism. This is unprecedented for an American political movement. But Black Lives Matter is even more powerful than that. It has singlehandedly revised our moral framework. Yes, black lives do matter. That is a statement of fact, and no decent person doubts that it is true because it is. And it is true precisely because every life matters. We are all human beings, every one of us. We have souls. Skin color is irrelevant to moral value. Until recently, this was considered obvious; saying it was regarded as a virtue. All lives matter equally. All of us were created by God. In the end, all of us will die. Nothing can change that -- not wealth, not fame, not race. Every life is precisely as valuable as every other life. By the way, that idea forms the basis of the Christian faith. It's the entire premise behind our founding documents. And yet, suddenly, thanks to Black Lives Matter, you can no longer say it out loud. Affirming the fundamental equality of all people is now considered hate speech. You can be fired for saying it. Again, many people have been. This is a dangerous moment. How did we get here? In a word, quickly. It happened fast. As recently as December, before the riots, most Americans did not approve of Black Lives Matter. The group was defined in the public mind by moments like this. Crowd (chanting): Pigs in a blanket. Fry them like bacon. Pigs in a blanket. Fry them like bacon. Pigs in a blanket. Fry them like bacon. Pigs in a blanket. Fry them like bacon. \"Pigs in a blanket.\" \"Fry like bacon.\" \"Kill the police.\" They yelled that at a rally. The usual liars immediately swooped in to pretend that it never happened. The president of the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote an entire op-ed ordering the public not to consider Black Lives Matter a hate group. But people could see the truth for themselves. That video was online. A lot of facts about Black Lives Matter still reside on the internet. They have not yet been scrubbed. This is a dangerous moment. How did we get here? In a word, quickly. It happened fast. The group's signature demand is to eliminate law enforcement. When you first heard protesters scream, \"Defund the police,\"\u00a0 it may have shocked you. That's just crazy, you may have thought. A few weeks later, support for eliminating law enforcement is rising quickly in the polls. Minneapolis is already doing it. Other cities will follow. Are you surprised? Almost no one in public life has pushed back meaningfully against the idea of defunding the police. The Black Lives Matter position is the only position most people hear. After a while, they believe it. Unchallenged claims must be true. That's what most people assume, and why wouldn't they assume that? If you strongly disagree with something, say so, otherwise, it's much more likely to happen. So, with that in mind, consider some of the other positions Black Lives Matter has endorsed. The repeal of all immigration restrictions, for starters. They're for that. The legalization of sex work -- prostitution -- they're for that, too. The destruction of the nuclear family, your family. The forced relocation of farmland. Race-based reparations, specifically \"in the form of a guaranteed minimum livable income for all black people.\" Hear that? All black people, not just the descendants of American slaves. This would include the millions of African and Caribbean immigrants who on average now earn more than native-born Americans. Every one of these new Americans would receive a guaranteed annual income from American taxpayers in order to atone for the sin of -- for the sin of what actually? Allowing them to immigrate here? Black Lives Matter does not explain that part. No one asked them. You could be fired for asking. What you cannot be punished for, however, is looting and burning, at least not if you're Black Lives Matter. Huge parts of urban landscape have been destroyed in the past month. Almost no one has been held to account for it,. Just the opposite. You're encouraged to pretend it never happened. In St. Louis, every rioter arrested has been released without charges. In New York, hundreds were released without bail. Same in Washington, D.C. It's happening almost everywhere, and not just in places controlled by elected Democrats which tells you a lot. Fort Worth, Texas, for example, is one of the few major American cities that is led by a Republican, Mayor Betsy Price. On May 31, a crowd of Black Lives Matter demonstrators blocked a bridge in downtown Fort Worth, when police arrived to disperse them, they threw rocks and bottles of bleach. Three police officers were injured. The mob then went on to loot and vandalize businesses. Dozens of rioters were arrested for this. Ten days later, the city's police chief, Ed Kraus, announced that he was dropping all charges against them. Kraus issued a statement suggesting that the real criminals in the riot were not the rioters, but his own police officers, whom he suggested would be reined in and perhaps punished. \"This is just one step on a long journey,\" Kraus wrote, sounding more like a therapist than a cop. The chief promised that his department was \"committed to walking the path of reform with our community.\" Kraus never bothered to explain exactly what his cops had done wrong. They were cops. That was enough. That same day, the Fort Worth School Board issued a statement declaring, \"Police practices are deeply rooted in white supremacy.\" Once again, no one specified which police practices reflected white supremacy, or what that accusation even meant. It was a blanket condemnation, but it was left to hang in the air. As usual, no one in authority pushed back against it\u00a0in a Republican-led city. Black Lives Matter believes in force. They flood the streets with angry young people who break things, and they hurt anyone who gets in the way. When they want something, they take it. Make them mad and they will set your business on fire. Annoy them and they will occupy your downtown and declare a brand new country. You're not going to do anything about it, they know that for certain. It'll be interesting to know what happens to the murder rate in Fort Worth over the next year. We can guess. We're seeing it all over the country. We've seen it many times through the years. When the people in charge undermine the law, violence surges. But there is a solution to this vortex and it's called leadership. Sixty-five years ago, politicians throughout the American South refused to submit to the Supreme Court's Brown vs. Board decision. Authorities in many states simply ignored the law like it didn't exist. Armed extremist groups filled the vacuum. They used violence to make their own laws. Ultimately, the federal government stepped in and restored order. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard of Arkansas. He sent troops to Little Rock to force Governor Orville Faubus to obey the law. So the question is, where is our Justice Department? Right now? Is there a reason the DOJ hasn't filed federal conspiracy charges against the people who organized and led these riots? It's not as if we don't know who they are. Their crimes are on YouTube. You know\u00a0the reason. Black Lives Matter was involved. It is politically sensitive. No prosecutor wants to be called a racist, as if it's racist to punish people for crimes they committed. You know what\u00a0the victims of those crimes think? The old people who were beaten to the ground for trying to defend their property. The shop owners whose life savings were stolen or burned. The families of the people who were murdered during the riots, and there were quite a few of them. No one is defending these people. No one is punishing their attackers. Nobody cares. Imagine how they feel about that. What recourse do they have? Do they have to torch a Wendy's or loot a Walmart to get our attention? Let's hope not. It might be enough to have a single national leader -- just one -- who understands what is actually going on in this country and is brave enough to say so. That might make all the difference, and it would certainly make the political career of the person who does it. In the fall of 1968, a teaching assistant at San Francisco State University called George Murray gave a speech endorsing racial violence. Murray urged black students to bring guns to campus and\u00a0\"kill all the slave masters.\" Murray, by the way, was the \"minister of education\" in the local Black Panther Party, which was the Antifa of its time. Black Lives Matter becomes more powerful and more popular with the public. Why is that happening exactly?\u00a0Here's why: Because Black Lives Matter is getting exactly what they want and that is the most basic sign of strength. Strength is the most appealing quality to voters and to people and to animals. When administrators learned about Murray's speech, they equivocated, but ultimately they suspended him under pressure. In response to this, a group called the Third World Liberation Front shut down the campus. Sound familiar? They demanded the university drop all admission standards for black applicants and admit students purely on the basis of race. The administrators were paralyzed in the face of this. More than anything, they didn't want to be called racist. The university's president was so terrorized by it that he quit and left. Ultimately, the leadership of San Francisco State fell to an unlikely president, a Japanese-Canadian academic called S.I. Hayakawa. Hayakawa was short, eccentric, wore thick glasses, but he was completely fearless. On December 2, 1968, Hayakawa marched into the middle of a student protest. Rioters immediately assaulted him, but Hayakawa kept going. He climbed onto the roof of a sound truck and ripped the wires out of the loudspeaker. San Francisco State University reopened that day. So here's the lesson for today's officeholders. S.I. Hayakawa became a folk hero for standing up to the mob. He was elected to the United States Senate from California. Republicans supported him. Voters did, too. They didn't always understand him. Hayakawa wore a Scottish tam o' shanter cap in public and never really explained why he did. But it didn't matter. He was brave and honest, and voters appreciated that above all. They always do. We don't have our Hayakawa yet. Instead, we have cowards. Our leaders are happy to talk about everything\u00a0but the collapse of the centuries' old civilization tumbling down around them. They have no idea how little credibility they have. They have no sense of how irrelevant they have become. If you can't tell the truth when the truth actually matters, then nothing you say matters. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter becomes more powerful and more popular with the public. Why is that happening exactly?\u00a0Here's why: Because Black Lives Matter is getting exactly what they want and that is the most basic sign of strength. Strength is the most appealing quality to voters and to people and to animals. Three weeks ago, Black Lives Matter demanded that cities defund their police. On Monday, the mighty NYPD, the biggest police department in our nation -- the most sophisticated police department in the world -- bowed and announced it is abolishing its entire plainclothes division, 600 people. Gone for good because Black Lives Matter wanted it done. And now it is done. That's not bluffing. It's not posturing. It's not tweeting. That is real power. You'll notice it did not require the usual maneuvering for Black Lives Matter to get that power. They didn't need a team of lawyers to get it. Black Lives Matter doesn't make legal arguments. They're not trying to convince you of anything. Black Lives Matter believes in force. They flood the streets with angry young people who break things, and they hurt anyone who gets in the way. When they want something, they take it. Make them mad and they will set your business on fire. Annoy them and they will occupy your downtown and declare a brand new country. You're not going to do anything about it, they know that for certain. This is the most destructive kind of politics. We've seen a lot of it in recent years. Organized groups did it to Brett Kavanaugh. The main point of slandering Kavanaugh was never to block his confirmation. We misread that. They knew they probably couldn't achieve it. The real point was to send Kavanaugh and John Roberts and the other Republican justices a very clear message, step out of line and we will hurt your families. And judging from recent court decisions, it\u00a0worked. At times, it's very clear that supposedly conservative justices are afraid to defy the mob. So what message do the rest of us take from what's happened over the past three weeks? It's very simple. The message is force is more effective than voting. Elections changed nothing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rioting, by contrast, makes you rich and powerful. When you riot, prosecutors will ignore the law on your behalf. Corporations will send you millions. Politicians will kneel down before you. It works. Violence works. That's the message. Everyone hears that message. Until violence stops working, violence will continue.

A North Carolina Town Hall has refused to take down Black Lives Matter flags even as early-voting is under way, according to reports. The town of Carrboro rejected the state elections director\u2019s request to remove the flag after an emergency meeting Thursday morning to discuss the matter, according to\u00a0the News Observer. \u201cThis is really important,\u201d Mayor Lydia Lavelle said on the video conference\u00a0call before closing the meeting to the public. MILLIONS OF YOUNG VOTERS DRIVING HUGE TURNOUT IN BATTLEGROUND STATES LIKE NC, FLORIDA Later Thursday afternoon, town spokesperson Catherine Lazorko confirmed the meeting was about the flags \u2014 and that they\u2019re staying up. Photo of Carrboro Town Hall from Town of Carrboro website \u201cAfter consulting with the town attorney, the Mayor and Town Council have chosen to leave the flags in place,\u201d Lazorko wrote in an email. In July, the town approved the flags \"supporting Black Lives Matter along with gel lights\" on the Town Hall, ABC 11 reported. The flags have remained in place since then, but residents have taken issue with the flags now that the election is underway. State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell sent a letter to the mayor, that explained the board had received \"emailed complaints\" about the voting site. ELECTION 5 DAYS AWAY: TRUMP, BIDEN TO HOLD DUELING RALLIES IN FLORIDA BATTLEGROUND \"After receiving word today from the General Counsel for the Republican Party that there were numerous additional complaints, we feel we must formally request you remove these flags for the duration of the early voting period, which concludes in three days on Saturday, October 31, 2020,\" the letter read. Carrboro Town Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to copies of the complaints, the residents claimed that the flags \"represent the views of one party\" or that the \"political\" flags represented \"voter intimidation at its finest.\" Waddy Davis, chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, said that he had received as many as 18 written complaints and many more by word of mouth.

As the Black Lives Matter movement becomes an influential political force\u00a0in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, some are now wondering if its followers --\u00a0frustrated by a two-party system that refuses to heed its calls --\u00a0could ultimately organize their own political party in the United States. Four years ago, 43 percent of American adults supported Black Lives Matter, according to the Pew Research Center. Today, two-thirds of U.S. adults say they support the movement and 38 percent say they strongly support it. While Democrats have sought to incorporate the movement into its party, some activists have been reluctant to do so: Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, for example,\u00a0recently ignited outrage by telling radio host Charlamagne tha God \u201cyou ain\u2019t black\u201d if you\u2019re figuring out whether to vote for him or President Trump. His comments renewed cries from African-Americans that the Democratic Party take\u00a0their vote for granted. \u201cThat someone could be so presumptuousness, that you have to vote for a Democrat or otherwise you\u2019re not identified as Black, that is the principal reason why we need a Black party, independent, to change that kind of behavior,\u201d Robert Johnson, the founder of BET, said in a recent interview. So, could Black Lives Matter mobilize into its own political party? Who is advocating for it? Johnson, the\u00a0first black billionaire in the U.S., said in an interview with Fox News that he sees the need for a group to stand up with the sole purpose of fighting for African-Americans because he said the Democratic Party hasn't delivered on mending the systemic wealth gap between white and black Americans. \"No minority group has ever achieved significant power in a two-party system when they are locked into one party and considered unreachable by the other party,\" Johnson said. BET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON SAYS DEMS TAKING BLACK VOTERS 'FOR GRANTED,' CALLS FOR BLM TO FORM PARTY Johnson said the permanent interests of African-Americans have diverged in many ways with the Democratic Party; now, with the nation behind the Black Lives Matter movement and racial injustice at the forefront, it's time to act. \"I propose that an independent party formed by Black Lives Matter should echo the founding principles of the original Congressional Black Caucus members in 1971 who ... said black Americans should have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests,\" Johnson said. Johnson suggested that Black Lives Matter run candidates for various offices and leverage their power in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where black voters staying home or breaking with Democrats can determine the outcome of the presidential election. He recently publicized this idea in an open letter to the BLM movement. Meanwhile, Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson has argued the movement has already become a political party, \"maybe the strongest political party in the United States,\"\u00a0after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was met with boos and threats to defeat him in the next election when he said, \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police department.\u201d NEW YORK, USA - JUNE 24: A group of Black Lives Matter protestors congregate at City Hall across from One Police Plaza as part of the \"Defund NYPD\" and \"Occupy City Hall\" movement after spending the night on June 24, 2020 in New York City, United States. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) How would it work? Getting added to the ballot\u00a0differs by state, but generally requires garnering signatures on a petition. In New York state, for example, the group would need to get 15,000 voters spread out across the state to sign a petition to have one or more candidates be added to the ballot. Distribution requirements say that more than 100 voters must sign in at least 15 Congressional districts. TUCKER CARLSON: BLACK LIVES MATTER IS NOW A POWERFUL POLITICAL PARTY AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BLACK LIVES If a party garners 50,000 votes in a gubernatorial election, it can host an official convention and earns a slot on the ballot for four years and can field candidates without having to get signatures each time. Johnson says a Black Lives Matter Party could be used as leverage to influence the two major parties. \u201cI\u2019ve been convinced for a long time that 40 million African Americans who tend to vote as a bloc in one of the two parties limit their leverage in getting action form both parties,\u201d Johnson told CNBC. \u201cHad African American interests been embraced by one or two of the dominant parties, we wouldn\u2019t have the tremendous social, economic, racial issues that we have now,\u201d Johnson said. Is it likely? It\u2019s still too early to tell. Black Lives Matter leaders have not publicly responded to Johnson\u2019s calls, and Fox News could not reach leadership for comment. \u201cThe two-party system in the U.S. is very well entrenched, and suggestions of a viable new party are unrealistic,\u201d David Hopkins, a Boston College political science professor who specializes in American politics, told Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s already a party that favors the Black Lives Matter movement, and it\u2019s the Democratic Party.\u201d In 2015, the Democratic National Committee unanimously adopted a resolution\u00a0in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. But members of the movement quickly disavowed all political affiliations. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cWe do not now, nor have we ever, endorsed or affiliated with the Democratic Party, or with any party,\u201d the Black Lives Matter network said in a response posted to its Facebook page. \u201cThe Democratic Party, like the Republican and all political parties, have historically attempted to control or contain black people\u2019s efforts to liberate ourselves. True change requires real struggle, and that struggle will be in the streets and led by the people, not by a political party.\u201d",

            "article_content": "New York Post writer Jon Levine on how a Democratic operative admitted to fraud. EXCLUSIVE --\u00a0With the\u00a02020 presidential\u00a0election less than a few weeks away --\u00a0encumbered yet again by questions and concerns surrounding ballot security and fraud --\u00a0revolutionary blockchain voting technology is being piloted in small pockets of the country. And Tuesday marked the first time a vote has ever been cast for a U.S. president in the general election using such an app on a personal mobile phone, Fox News has learned exclusively. \u201cThis is a historic day not only for ballot integrity and election systems but for liberty and the republic itself,\u201d Josh Daniels, a\u00a0Utah\u00a0resident, told Fox News in a statement. His vote went to former \u201cMighty Ducks\u201d child actor turned cryptocurrency entrepreneur turned 2020\u00a0independent\u00a0candidate\u00a0Brock Pierce. \u201cIn true pioneer spirit, Utah County is honored to be the first place where a Blockchain vote was cast in a presidential general election,\u201d said Utah County Clerk Amelia Powers Gardner, who implemented the \u201cVoatz\u201d platform as both a\u00a0security\u00a0and cost-cutting measure 20 months ago. \u201cWe are proud to lead our state and the nation on this innovative and cutting edge technology.\u201d Gardner, who has been using the system for five elections, says\u00a0it is \u201cone of the most cost-effective initiatives\" that her office has undertaken since she was elected 20 months ago. FLORIDIANS HAVE ALREADY CAST 1.8 MILLION BALLOTS FOR THE 2020 ELECTION And much of Pierce\u2019s own campaign is centered on the push for technological innovation to solve the plethora of problems nationwide and ensure America retains her spot as the global frontrunner in modernization and advancement across all major industries. \u201cThe problem with the internet is that you can copy anything \u2013 songs, videos, pictures. Internet technology does not allow for the information to stay in one place only,\u201d Pierce told Fox News. \u201cBut blockchain is a database at its core, and that database is impervious to any type of duplication, meaning it cannot be tampered with and there can only be one version of it, so when we talk about voting, it is perfectly suited to elections. It ensures the absolute integrity of our elections; it ensures voters can vote with confidence.\u201d \u201cIn true pioneer spirit, Utah County is honored to be the first place where a Blockchain vote was casted in a presidential general election,\u201d said Utah County Clerk Amelia Powers Gardner, who implemented the \u201cVoatz\u201d platform as both a security and cost-cutting measure 20 months ago. (Brock Pierce Campaign) Just last week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI\u00a0released\u00a0a joint advisory warning of \u201cadvanced persistent threat (APT) actors chaining vulnerabilities\u2014a commonly used tactic exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in the course of a single intrusion\u2014in an attempt to compromise federal and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government networks, critical infrastructure, and elections organizations.\u201d CISA stressed that it is \u201caware of some instances where this activity resulted in unauthorized access to elections support systems; however, it has no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised\u201d \u2013 at least for now. From Pierce\u2019s lens, this should all be a problem of the past \u2013 at least in elections to come \u2013 and is slowly becoming a staple of the present. The U.S. electoral system, for the most part, in Pierce\u2019s purview, is still trying to use \u201c20th-century solutions for 21st-century problems,\u201d but through blockchain, \u201ceveryone can vote from their phone, with no need to go to a voting booth.\u201d For one, \u201cVoatz,\u201d was most recently used in the 2020 Utah State GOP Convention and enabled voting for almost 4,000 delegates in 40 races, in addition to the Arizona GOP Convention, South Dakota GOP Convention\u00a0and the Michigan Democratic Party Convention. Childhood actor Brock Pierce's name will appear in at least 15 states on the 2020 presidential ballot. (Courtesy Brock Pierce) It was also used as a temporary mobile voting solution to record votes for deployed U.S. military members by West Virginia in 2018, during the 2017 Tufts Community Union Senate Election in Massachusetts\u00a0as well as to authenticate delegate badges at the 2016 Massachusetts Democratic State Convention and So how does the technology work? The Voatz app, which requires a phone number, photo identification\u00a0and an authenticating \u201cselfie,\u201d uses both blockchain technology and biometrics to verify the voter\u2019s identity. A secure token is issued via fingerprint activation, and once a vote is submitted, it is printed and fed into a collation machine for tabulation. \u201cVoatz is a mobile elections platform that allows disenfranchised groups access to voting, including overseas citizens, deployed military\u00a0and people with disabilities,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s the only platform designed to meet the four criteria required for mobile voting: security, identity confirmation, accessibility\u00a0and audibility.\u201d At the DEF CON Hacking Conference Voting Village, Fox News is shown a prototype for a research project that could combine blockchain technology and paper ballots embedded with codes that can be scanned digitally. The spokesperson also underscored that \u201call submitted ballots are eligible to undergo a public citizen\u2019s post-election audit, in which anyone is able to participate as an auditor, hosted by the National Cybersecurity Center.\u201d However, it is one of several blockchain applications cropping up across the U.S.\u00a0in what many entrepreneurs predict is a pivotal step in ensuring fraud-free and fair elections. According to data compiled by\u00a0Pitchbook, a capital marketing company, more than $420 million has been poured into at least 27 election tech startups by 88 investors since the 2016 election, with the intention of revolutionizing the U.S. voting system. PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON MAIL-IN BALLOT SIGNATURE CONTROVERSY Supporters of the blockchain voting modalities are also quick to point out that it is a pro for both sides of the political aisle\u00a0and one that will ultimately lead to increased voter numbers and civic engagement across the board, given its accessibility. Average voter turnout in the United States for general elections over the past five decades hovers at around 52%, with local government elections often as low as under 10%. \u201cThe accessibility will drive engagement. It will allow many more people to participate in the democratic process,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a bipartisan solution \u2013 all parties want security, and all parties want more voters and higher engagement.\u201d And in terms of ensuring that those without phones or in lower socio-economic community sectors, Pierce underscored that it need not be an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach and that electronic voting should be utilized in addition to traditional polling booths. However, turning to\u00a0blockchain\u00a0\u2013 and in due course, the thin rectangles that slip into one\u2019s pocket \u2013 to carry out our constitutional right is one that is met with skepticism and security concerns by some experts, who say some of the touted technology just is not there yet. \u201cAs common sense dictates, in lockstep with improvements in technology and information security, hackers have started getting more creative with the scams and hacks they carry out, and blockchain breaches have been famously eviscerated with hacks,\u201d contended Carl Herberger, vice president of\u00a0security services at CyberSheath. \u201cThrough these hacks, we\u2019ve learned that you could be one click away from malware that will cause harm to your files and crypto-assets. A blockchain hack could lead to far more systemic and scaled collapses as once hacked. Blockchain renders the entire system insecure.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yet the likes of Pierce still beg to differ, stressing that it is the inevitable way of the future. \u201cNo one wants to turn this technology on in 2024; we are going to start seeing it much more in 2021 and 2022. I think by 2026 we will see it all over the world \u2013 people voting from their phones,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd people can have confidence in the system. Right now, many people lack that faith. This technology can restore that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Peaceful protests continue in Washington, DC in wake of George Floyd's death. Hundreds of thousands\u00a0of protesters gathered\u00a0Saturday across Washington D.C., including near the White House, to march against police brutality and racism in response to the recent death of George Floyd in police custody -- part of protests that took place in cities across the U.S. Black Lives Matter organizers were hoping to draw a million protesters, with groups of demonstrators gathering at the Capitol, the National Mall, and with thousands\u00a0gathering near\u00a0the White House. A law enforcement source told\u00a0Fox News that an\u00a0estimated 200,000 people came to protest in D.C.\u00a0throughout the course of the day. One crowd of\u00a0about 2,000 people gathered at Malcolm X Park at one point and, after giving speeches and singing, began marching down 16th Street toward the White House,\u00a0according to Fox News' Kelly Phares. Protesters gathered in front of newly-installed high fencing that was\u00a0keeping\u00a0protestors out of Lafayette Park in front of the White House. Authorities have expanded the fenced security perimeter around the White House, which now reaches\u00a0to the outskirts of a park complex known as the Ellipse, near the National Mall. It comes amid concerns that the mostly peaceful protests seen in recent days could be marred by the rioting and looting seen at the beginning of the week and last weekend. \u201cWe have a lot of public, open-source information to suggest that the event on this upcoming Saturday may be one of the largest that we\u2019ve had in the city,\u201d D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Thursday. President Trump tweeted that there was a \"much smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated.\" \"National Guard, Secret Service, and D.C. Police have been doing a fantastic job. Thank you!\" he tweeted. Protesters also demonstrated in San Francisco and New York City, as well as Philadelphia and Chicago. As of Saturday evening there were few signs of the violence that had marred previous protests in recent days. It was not clear how many would show up for\u00a0Saturday\u2019s demonstrations, but #1MillionDCSaturday was trending on Twitter in a call for 1 million people to march on the capital. Crowds applauded for D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as she walked along the portion of 16th Street that she renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza. Bowser has feuded with President Trump over the city's handling of the protests, that devolved into riots earlier in the week. Trump accused her of not doing enough to shut down the violence, while Bowser has pushed back on Trump's calls for the use of federal law enforcement to quell disturbances. Uniformed military personnel walk in front of the White House ahead of a protest against racial inequality in the aftermath of the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Washington, U.S. June 6, 2020.\u00a0 (Reuters) Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said Friday that local officials were estimating a crowd of 100,000 to 200,000 protesters. DC READIES FOR SATURDAY PROTESTS AS POLICE CHIEF SAYS IT MAY BE 'LARGEST WE'VE HAD IN THE CITY' Newsham wouldn\u2019t commit to a number but predicted it would be smaller than the Women's March in 2017, which drew roughly a million people. Police announced Friday that large swaths of roads would be closed to make room for demonstrators Saturday. U.S. Park Police told McClatchy DC it was using \u201cintelligence to monitor upcoming events\u201d but would not divulge details that could \u201cpose a hazard to the public and police.\u201d More than 4,500 National Guard troops are still deployed in Washington and various federal law enforcement officers are also patrolling the city, But Bowser wants all non-D.C.troops out of the city. All 900 active-duty military police brought to bases around Washington following the civil unrest after Floyd\u2019s death are heading home, the Department of Defense said Friday. Bowser said she only requested 100 D.C. National Guard troops to line the perimeter of the White House, in a limited role and unarmed. Protesters have lined the streets surrounding the White House every day this week.\u00a0 On Monday, riot police cleared peaceful protesters out of Lafayette Square, using pepper balls and smoke canisters, so that President Trump could walk to a neighboring church for a photo op. Uniformed military personnel walks into the secured White House area ahead of a protest against racial inequality in reaction to the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Washington, U.S., June 6, 2020.\u00a0 (Reuters) Since then protests have been largely peaceful with few arrests, and the city has not enforced a curfew since Wednesday night. Across the nation, the number of National Guard troops mobilized across the country has doubled in the past four days. The National Guard tweet Saturday that 43,000 troops were deployed across 34 states and D.C. to assist law enforcement with civil unrest, while 37,000 Guard soldiers and airmen continue to assist with Covid-19 response. Dozens of protests are planned across all boroughs in New York City, after Friday the Manhattan DA\u00a0Cyrus\u00a0Vance Jr. announced\u00a0that his office would not prosecute protesters charged with breaking curfew or other low-level offenses. Protesters charged with low-level offenses \"undermines critical bonds between law enforcement and the communities we serve,\u201d the district attorney said. New York City has an 8 p.m. curfew in place until Sunday night, after looters ransacked businesses, mostly at the beginning of the week. There have been a number of clashes between officers and aggressive protesters, but as\u00a0the week has progressed, protests have grown more peaceful.\u00a0\u00a0Police say they\u2019ve arrested in the city about 2,500 people since the end of May. On Friday, Mayor Bill de Blasio explained why he didn't lift the curfew. \"Anyone who would say 'Is it more harm than good?' I would say no. We've had three really good nights after two really bad nights,\" the mayor said.

The city shut down a number of main streets and modified transit routes for Saturday to make room for protesters. Chicago's 9 p.m. curfew remains in place over the weekend. At the same time, thousands of mourners showed up Saturday to remember Floyd\u00a0ahead of a second memorial service, this time in\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0near where he was born. The mourners lined up Saturday morning for a two-hour public viewing of his casket at Cape Fear Conference B in Raeford, about 24 miles from Fayetteville.\u00a0A private service for family members only begins at 3 p.m. local time but is being broadcast.

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he looks forward to debating President Trump. Peter Doocy reports. American politics is so divided these days that, for many, defeating the other party\u2019s candidate appears to be all that matters,\u00a0so much so that the candidate\u2019s policies are almost completely ignored.\u00a0In this election, however, that\u2019s a dangerous dynamic given that Biden\u2019s policy choices would do unprecedented damage to the United States and the world. As a historical matter, the larger or more powerful representative governments become, the greater the gap between the major parties and their policies becomes.\u00a0For instance, the history of the differences between England\u2019s Labor Party and Conservative Party on the issue of the nationalization of industries provides the United States with a vivid example of what could lie ahead for us if our two parties continue along their current trajectories. This November, the difference between the policies offered by President Trump and Joe Biden will be as wide as any in the last 50 years. BIDEN TO 'SPEND SOME TIME' WITH VETTED VP CANDIDATES IN COMING DAYS, TOP OFFICIAL SAYS Biden\u2019s Policies Would Impose An Economic Depression Previously Steve Moore and I wrote that Joe Biden\u2019s policies would push the United States into a depression.\u00a0That is not a difficult prediction to make. The U.S. economy is already weak with record numbers of people on government assistance in the form of unemployment benefits and loans or grants to businesses.\u00a0Entire industries such as travel, schools, entertainment and restaurants are facing uncertain futures.\u00a0Indeed, there is no certainty they will come back to anywhere close to pre-COVID-19 levels. Even if they did, there is no certainty how long that would take. In July of 2008, I predicted that candidate Barack Obama\u2019s policies would lead to poor economic times for as long as he would be president. It was an easy prediction to make because the economy he inherited was already in trouble,\u00a0and all of Obama\u2019s likely policies were only going to raise costs on doing business in America. Obama\u2019s tax and regulatory policies made a bad situation unnecessarily worse and gave him the worst economic record of any American President. The magnitude of Joe Biden\u2019s tax hikes and regulatory hikes far exceed Obama\u2019s policies. As Steve Moore and I wrote, Biden\u2019s policies are particularly damaging to business startups.\u00a0They will drag the economy down at a time when we need to provide incentives to start-ups \u2013 not kill them off. Beyond that, Biden\u2019s war on energy will cripple an industry that has been a major source of the economic growth America has enjoyed for years. Biden\u2019s Policies Would Weaken Us and Strengthen Russia, Iran and China President\u2019s Trump greatest foreign policy achievement occurred without firing a shot.\u00a0By unleashing the American energy industry, Trump lowered the price of energy and gained new customers around the world for American oil and gas. Trump\u2019s policy defunded Russia and Iran, for whom energy is their main trading commodity because they lost energy customers and access to hard currency as prices dropped. A defunded Iran and Russia directly led to them being less provocative.\u00a0Both have precarious economies as a matter of course because they are centrally planned. Less oil money for them means they have less money to spend on terror and international intrigue. Incredibly, Joe Biden wants to empower them. Biden\u2019s war on energy would raise the price of energy and put Iran and Russia back in the game.\u00a0Biden literally would make the United States\u2019 economy more centrally planned, weaken it, thereby hobbling U.S. foreign policy,\u00a0and enable the centrally planned governments of Russia and Iran to exploit the only lifeline they have \u2013 their oil reserves. The stupidity of such a policy and long-term implications cannot be understated \u2013 but it gets worse. Who benefits most from a weaker United States? China. China gains whenever the United States is economically weak. China is the most aggressive country in the world with enormous means. Joe Biden would unleash them as well. In sum, the combination of Biden\u2019s bad economic policies will not only push the United States into a depression;\u00a0it will embolden our worst enemies whose fortunes will rise. Law and Order Under Biden Would Suffer Irreversible Harm Law and Order, like reputations, is easier maintained than recovered. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER If you recall, after President Obama became president, his Attorney General dropped charges against several New Black Panther Party members who clearly engaged in voter intimidation in Philadelphia.\u00a0It was a total miscarriage of justice. Now imagine a 2021 when Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general drops the Durham investigation. From there any illegal activity in which the BLM has engaged and those that have damaged federal statues, and on and on, will be dropped. It won\u2019t stop there, however.\u00a0Instead, the pushover Joe Biden (as the Marxist Angela Davis has described him) will seek to redefine social justice in America at the expense of the rule of law.\u00a0Finally, Democrats in Congress will reinstate discredited investigations of Republicans. Meanwhile, law and order in our major cities will continue to decline while the 2nd Amendment is assaulted as never before. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Overall, between his economic policies that will result in a depression and his social justice policies, Biden will plunge America into a new round of class warfare that will reach unprecedented heights. As we turn on each other, our attention from the world will be averted. That will give freer rein to the actions of Iran, Russia and China. That\u2019s what lies ahead under a Joe Biden presidency \u2013 elections have consequences and policy matters. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TOM DEL BECCARO",

(Andrew Matthews/PA via AP) The Black Lives Matter movement will develop an armed branch of \u201cpeace officers\u201d\u00a0to combat police brutality in black communities during the so-called war on police,\u00a0according to one of its leaders. Protests broke out across the country following the death of unarmed Minneapolis black man George Floyd while in police custody, bringing the BLM movement back into national focus. In an interview with the Daily Mail, BLM New York chapter Chairman Hawk Newsome described how the group plans to follow in the footsteps of the Black Panthers Party by matching fire with fire \u2013 when necessary. MINNEAPOLIS OFFICER'S MURDER CHARGE EXPECTED TO BE UPGRADED IN GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH \u201cWe're talking about self-defense. We're talking about defending our communities,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cYou know what it's like to see a taser pointed at a 7-year-old, you know what it's like to see a 67-year-old black woman ... pepper sprayed and pushed to the ground?\u201d \u201cWe are preparing and training our people to defend our communities.\u201d Newsome attended a national conference in Los Angeles of party leadership to discuss how the movement can create a \u201cpathway forward\u201d for people. The plan, called \u201cBlack Opts\u201d for Black Opportunities, details how the movement can help to liberate black people. \u201cWe have black Special Forces officers advising us, and we will teach and train people in our communities, the Black Opts department of Black Opportunities,\u201d Newsome said. Demonstrators protest the death of George Floyd, Wednesday, June 3, 2020, near the White House in Washington. Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) The move is reminiscent of the Black Panthers Party, which created \"peace officers\"\u00a0who open-carried firearms while patrolling black communities in order to deter police brutality. Newsome confirmed that the BLM \"peace officers\"\u00a0would also be armed and open carry guns in states that allow it. \u201cWe pattern ourselves after the Black Panthers, after the Nation of Islam, we believe that we need an arm to defend ourselves,\u201d Newsome explained. \u201cWe will build and train peace officers to keep the peace in our communities, to defend our communities, to keep our communities safe.\u201d CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS TAKE A KNEE TO CHEERS OF PROTESTERS The New York chapter is at the forefront of the movement, the largest of the 40 chapters the organization operates globally, according to its website. Newsome, who worked as a project manager at a law firm before becoming full-time activist, claimed his chapter has grown into one of the most effective ones in the world. Newsome says his chapter is raising funds for a \u201cwar chest\u201d and plans to build a headquarters in an unused church in New York. \u201cWhen we start talking about black opportunities and building our war chest to defend ourselves from the war on the poor. .. to defend ourselves against the war that is anti-blackness in America, then people will have to meet a certain criteria.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The \u201cblueprint\u201d for the way forward will be unveiled in Times Square in New York on Sunday at 12 p.m. and delivered to communities across the country.",

During the final presidential debate, Trump was grilled by moderator Kristen Welker about his rhetoric toward\u00a0Black Lives Matter, which he previously described as a \"symbol of hate,\" and was asked what he would say to people who say he \"contributes\" to the nation's \"climate of racial hatred and strife.\" \"Well, you have to understand. The first time I've ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting 'Pigs in a blanket,' talking about police. 'Pigs,' talking about our police. 'Pigs in a blanket, fry'em like bacon.' I said that's a horrible thing and they were marching down the street,\" Trump explained. \"And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it a terrible thing.\" CRITICS PRAISE NBC'S KRISTEN WELKER, DECLARE HER 'BEST 2020 DEBATE MODERATOR' Trump was referring to footage from a 2015 demonstration in St. Paul, Minn., where marchers were seen holding a large Black Lives Matter banner and chanting\u00a0\"Pigs in a blanket, fry'em like bacon.\" Reid offered an emotional fact-check, calling any attempt to tie the slogan to BLM\u00a0a \"lie,\" and insisting that a march she personally attended did not include the chant \"Pigs in a blanket, fry'em like bacon,\" though she didn't specify if she was referring to that same 2015 St. Paul march. \"There was an offshoot separate group of people. Nobody knows who they are. I know a whole lot of people in Black Lives Matter,\" Reid told her MSNBC colleagues. \"I know a whole lot of people who started it and who were leaders in it. Not a single person knows who these people were that started that chant. They were never connected to the march.\" \"There is absolutely zero, none, zero evidence that Black Lives Matter has ever pushed for anything violent, pushed for anything violent\u00a0to happen to police,\" Reid continued. \"Black Lives Matter is about one thing: stop killing Black people just because you've pulled them over for a parking violation or a moving violation. Just stop killing Black people. They have never advocated for violence against police.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The \"ReidOut\" host went on to call Trump's remarks \"stupid\" as he continues his outreach toward\u00a0Black voters. \"So this lie about Black Lives Matter has to end, it has to stop,\" Reid concluded.

President Trump called mail-in voting a \u201cscam\u201d during a Friday press conference, attempting to draw a line between people that specifically request absentee ballots, and states where mail-in ballots are being widely issued. \u201cThey\u2019re sending out tens of millions of ballots to everybody, people that didn\u2019t expect them. People are getting inundated with ballots, they\u2019ll be showered with ballots,\u201d Trump said Friday. Several states, including Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, will automatically send out\u00a0mail-in ballots\u00a0to all state residents for the general election. MICHIGAN JUDGE SAYS BALLOTS RECEIVED WITHIN 14 DAYS OF ELECTION SHOULD COUNT IF POSTMARKED ON TIME But due to the coronavirus pandemic, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont, and\u00a0Washington, D.C. have also introduced similar methods for the 2020 election. Ballots will be automatically mailed out to all residents. Several other states have also taken measures to ensure citizens can vote by mail rather than at a polling station come November. \u201cEverybody in this room knows it\u2019s a scam,\u201d the president continued, gesturing to the White House press pool. \u201cThey are never going to be able to count them.\u201d More than half of all Americans are expected to vote through the mail this presidential election, though over 40 percent of Americans voted by mail in the 2016 and 2012 general elections, according to the Election Assistance Commission. Trump said that 80 million Americans can expect to receive mail-in ballots as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, a figure he has alleged will invalidate the 2020 election results. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster, everyone knows it,\u201d Trump told reporters before adding that the U.S. Postal Service was\u00a0not to blame for the 2020 primary election mishaps, when\u00a0hundreds of thousands of ballots went uncounted due to alleged mail inefficiencies. \u201cWhere are these ballots going? Who\u2019s sending them?\u00a0 Who\u2019s signing them?\u201d Trump asked, attempting to show why he thinks voting through the mail is insecure. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a terrible time for this country and we are counting on federal judges to do a great constitutional job.\u201d A Michigan judge on Friday extended the state\u2019s ballot acceptance deadline to 14 days after the polls close on Nov. 3, so long as the ballots are postmarked by the second of November. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court similarly granted a three-day extension past Election Day, allowing late ballots to be counted in the swing state as long as they were postmarked by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3. Michigan Judge Cynthia Diane Stephens said the decision was made in light of the \u201ccompromised\u201d U.S.P.S. delivery capabilities. But she pushed back on GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration\u2019s repeated claims that voter fraud will increase because of mail-in voting, and therefore jeopardize the validity of the election\u2019s results. \u201cThe incidences of voter fraud and absentee ballot fraud are minimal and the fears of the same are largely exaggerated,\u201d Stephens ruled. Though Trump called mail-in voting a \u201cscam,\u201d he applauded the states' recent decisions to extend ballot acceptance deadlines. Now 20 states and the District of Columbia will accept postmarked ballots that arrive after Election Day \u2013 including 12 of which voted Republican in the last presidential election. Trump proceeded to blame Democrats for the rise in mail-in ballots, claiming \u201cThey know it\u2019s going to be a mess.\u201d But congressional Democrats believe that the Trump administration is working to prevent mail-in ballots to circumvent voting during the 2020 presidential election, in an attempt to sway the results. Democrats in Congress initiated an investigation following comments made by Trump in a FOX\u00a0Business interview with Maria Bartiromo where he suggested\u00a0he\u00a0purposefully blocked funding to the U.S.P.S. to prevent their ability to cope with the expected increase of mail-in ballots because of the pandemic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The House additionally passed a $25 billion bill to provide assistance to U.S.P.S. for the expected workflow increase during the general election. The bill is awaiting the Senate\u2019s vote \u2013 though even if the bill somehow passed\u00a0the GOP-controlled Senate, Trump said he would veto it. \u201cThere are going to be millions of missing ballots,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be fraud, it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d \u201cThis is going to be the scam of all time,\u201d Trump told reporters, concluding his press conference.",

            "article_content": "<br> The polls closed on Tuesday night, and Americans still don\u2019t know who won the presidency. As usual, when things go haywire, Democrats are to blame. Democrats are 100 percent responsible for the dog\u2019s breakfast that the Trump-Biden race has become. They exploited COVID-19 to expand mass-mail-in ballots. In-person voting was too risky, they insisted. Then they demanded early in-person voting. Which was it? Democrat politicians and liberal judges weakened or abandoned signature-verification rules, expanded vote harvesting, and extended deadlines for submitting ballots beyond Election Day. They dropped requirements that ballots be postmarked by midnight on November 3. Perhaps bowing to multiculturalism, Democrats have turned America\u2019s voting\u00a0system into something\u00a0that even the Third World would scorn. NEWT GINGRICH: ELECTION CORRUPTION BY TRUMP OPPONENTS WIDESPREAD \u2014 IT\u2019S TIME FOR US TO GET MAD Nevada Democrats got this ugly ball rolling by blasting ballots across the Silver State, as if from a confetti cannon. These were not standard absentee ballots requested by actual voters who were sick, infirm, or away. Instead, Democrats sent unrequested ballots to every registered voter. So, no surprise, sacred ballots got mailed to inactive, relocated, and even dead voters. Las Vegas resident Jim\u00a0Murphy\u00a0was disgusted last month to find 15 such ballots strewn about the pavement at his apartment complex and, sickeningly, inside a nearby trash can. Mass-mail-in ballots litter the sidewalk outside a Las Vegas apartment building, October 2020. Photo courtesy of Jim Murphy \u201cI\u2019m sure this is happening all over the state,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned my vote gets canceled out by one of these orphan ballots.\u201d Murphy returned these ballots to his building\u2019s management and hoped for the best. Were others so honest? Who knows? \u201cMail-in voting is not how our Founding Fathers intended for us to vote. I believe that the Democrats know this was going to happen, and that is exactly what they wanted,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cSending ballots out to everyone who ever registered is simply nothing but chaos! And it leaves the opportunity for fraud.\u201d Mass-mail-in ballots sit atop junk mail in a trash can beside a Las Vegas apartment building, October 2020. Photo courtesy of Jim Murphy. No wonder President Donald J. Trump calls these \u201cThe phony ballots that are all crooked as hell.\u201d Democrats have diluted or scrapped signature-verification standards. Most Nevada counting machines accept ballot envelopes with signatures that match those on-file at least 50 percent. Clark County (Las Vegas) Democrats are counting ballots that match just 40 percent (a 60 percent mismatch). This is a forger\u2019s dream. Further breaking the chain of custody between ballots and election officials, Democrats pushed ballot drop-off boxes, which sat on sidewalks, unsupervised. Brilliant. In Baldwin Park, California, an arsonist ignited one such box. Mayor Manuel Lozano said nearly 100 ballots were burned or wet. Were these ballots legitimate, or did fraudsters complete mass-mail ballots on behalf of dead or relocated voters? Who knows? In Boston, a derelict named Worldly Armand allegedly torched a drop box near Copley Square. Among 122 ballots involved, 35 were too torched to tabulate. Nice work, Democrats. With no poll workers to guard them, at least three dozen ballots were found in bags of stolen mail tossed into a Seattle-area ditch, according to Washington State officials. Near Louisville, Kentucky, 112 absentee ballots headed for Zip code 40299 were discovered in a dumpster. Authorities charged a\u00a0now-dismissed Postal Service employee. While the blank ballots eventually got delivered, how many such ballots languish in landfills or, even worse, got submitted by cheaters? Who knows? Skullduggery aside, the Democrats\u2019 mass-mail-in ballot panacea turns out to be snake oil, among other factors, thanks to the inconsistent U.S. Postal Service. USPS aims for 97 percent correct, timely delivery of electoral and political mail. Thus, 3 percent failure is not a bug. It\u2019s a feature. With Biden and Trump separated today in some states by mere decimal points, not delivering 3 percent of mail-in ballots profoundly could influence this race and, frankly, American history. That makes this news downright disturbing: The Washington Post reports that USPS did not deliver some 150,000 ballots by Election Day. In five swing states, USPS properly delivered just 84.6 percent of electoral mail. As the Post explained: \u201cThat means roughly 15 out of every 100 ballots in processing plants were not sorted \u2014 or delivered \u2014 in time.\u201d This included 2,958 in North Carolina and 3,439 in Pennsylvania. Fairly or not, these late arrivals will be counted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Meanwhile, the 864 late ballots in Arizona and 853 in Georgia were disqualified. With Biden leading Trump in the Peach State by just 1,557 votes at this writing, the absence of that many \u201cIt\u2019s too late, baby\u201d votes could have an enormous impact on the final outcome. Epic fail. Furthermore, since Election Day, dodgy deeds have unfolded across Democrat-led jurisdictions. \u2022California will count Election-Day-postmarked ballots that arrive through November 20, the Friday before Thanksgiving! That\u2019s seventeen days after Election Day and 43 days since mail-in ballots were distributed on October 5. Come on, man! \u2022In Atlanta, Georgia, Republican poll watchers have been ordered out of vote-tabulation facilities. According to one poll worker\u2019s affidavit, verboten ballots that arrived after Election Day\u00a0are being comingled with genuine votes. \u2022\u201cWe want all the Republican challengers out of this room!\u201d yelled a man wearing an official-looking lanyard in a Detroit, Michigan, vote-counting facility. As GOP observers were forced out, people in BLM shirts reportedly applauded. In a literal assault on transparency, the tabulation room\u2019s windows were papered over to conceal actions within. \u2022In North Carolina, mail-in ballots may arrive for tabulation until November 9. Democrats begged for this extra time. Tarheel ballots began arriving September 5 \u2014 59 days before November 3. Was that too little time for Democrats? \u2022A Pennsylvania judge ordered election officials to let Republicans observe vote counts at six feet of social distance. GOP witnesses previously were kept 30 to 100 feet away, behind police barricades. Some watched the tally through binoculars. Pennsylvania\u2019s Democrat-dominated Supreme Court accepted mail-in ballots until November 6, violating state law. Postmarks and matching signatures are optional. What could go wrong? Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight reported via Twitter on Wednesday: \u201cTwo more batches of Pennsylvania vote were reported: -23,277 votes in Philadelphia, all for Biden -about 5,300 votes in Luzerne County, nearly 4,000 of which were for Biden.\u201d The first figure is terrifying and demands immediate investigation. Second, 4,000 votes among 5,300 in Luzern County represents 75.5 percent for Biden. Strange: Real Clear Politics finds Biden losing there with 42.2 percent versus 56.8 percent for Trump.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza suggested on Wednesday that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron sounded like a notorious segregationist and racist from the civil rights era. Her comments came on MSNBC's \"The ReidOut\" after Cameron spoke about the grand jury's decision to indict one of the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death on three counts of wanton\u00a0endangerment. \"I think what I\u00a0saw this morning was a Bull\u00a0Connor speech in 2020,\" she said,\u00a0referring to the former Alabama politician.\u00a0\"And you\u2019re right,\" she told MSNBC host Joy Reid,\u00a0\"unfortunately,\u00a0it was being given by a Black\u00a0prosecutor.\" MSNBC GUEST SAYS BLACK KENTUCKY AG IS 'SKINFOLK' BUT 'NOT KINFOLK' Reid had urged viewers to focus on Cameron's affiliation with the Republican Party, saying the fact he was Black didn't mean anything. \"I think you have to always look at\u00a0party.\u00a0Party is the religion now in\u00a0America -- especially for Republicans.\u00a0Don\u2019t look at the fact that this\u00a0guy is black.

It does not fit the mold of public opinion.\u00a0And it does not conform to shifting standards. It answers only to the facts and to the law.\" Earlier in the day, a guest on MSNBC appeared to lob a racial criticism at Cameron. \"Let me say\u00a0this as a Black woman, he\u00a0does not speak for Black folks,\" said Cheryl Dorsey, a retired Los Angeles Police Department sergeant.\u00a0\"He's skinfolk but not he is\u00a0not kinfolk. ...

Greater New York Black Lives Matter president Hawk Newsome joined \"The Story\" Wednesday to discuss the direction of the\u00a0movement in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody and the subsequent demonstrations across the country, many of which have sparked destruction and violence. \"You ...\u00a0have\u00a0said that violence is sometimes necessary in these situations,\" host Martha MacCallum told Newsome.\u00a0\"What exactly is it that you hope to achieve through violence?\" \"Wow, it's interesting that you would pose that question like that,\" Newsome responded, \"because this country is built upon violence.

All right?\u00a0And I could be speaking ...\u00a0figuratively. I could be speaking literally.

Think about the last few weeks since we started protesting. There have been eight cops fired across the country.\" \"I don't condone nor do I condemn rioting,\" Newsome added. \"But I'm just telling you what I observed.\" Later in the interview, Newsome insisted the Black Lives Matter movement is about\u00a0\"saving lives\" and its adherents\u00a0should be \"applauded\" for upholding the Second Amendment. \"Nobody's talking about ambushing police officers. We're talking about protecting lives,\" he said. \"There's nothing more American than that.

            "article_content": "Robert Johnson questions whether former Vice President Joe Biden truly believes African Americans should have an 'equal seat at the table in the Democratic Party.' BET founder Robert Johnson\u00a0says the Democratic Party has taken black voters in America for granted, and he urges\u00a0the ascendant Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement to form a new third party to fight for their interests. In a wide-ranging\u00a0interview with Fox News that touched on 2020 politics, civil unrest and more, Johnson delivered an unvarnished assessment on the current relationship between black voters and the Democratic Party. And he had choice words for the party's presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, who recently told a radio host\u00a0\"you ain't black\" if you don't support him -- citing the incident as he made the case for a new party. \"Vice President Biden said to an African-American, a black American host on his show, even if you think about voting for Donald Trump, you're not black,\"\u00a0Johnson told Fox News. \"To have that mindset, you must have the attitude that we, black Americans, we own you. We can take you for granted ... That, to me, shows you that black Americans are an appendage of a party.\u201d BET CO-FOUNDER BLASTS BIDEN OVER COMMENTS ON BLACK VOTERS: 'ARROGANT AND OUT-OF-TOUCH ATTITUDE' He later added: \"That's the biggest turnoff I've heard from a politician in a long time.\" Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said his\u00a0comments in a May interview with Charlamagne tha God were a \"mistake\" and chalked up the remark to the host being a \"wise guy\" and him responding in kind. But Johnson said the former vice president\u00a0gives him \u201ca lot of pause\u201d and questioned\u00a0whether Biden\u00a0believes African-Americans should have an \u201cequal seat at the table in the Democratic Party.\u201d A recent\u00a0Washington Post-Ipsos poll, however, shows that Biden currently holds a commanding lead over President Trump among\u00a0black registered voters, 92 percent to 5 percent. The voters polled say\u00a0racism and police conduct are the most important issues in their choice of candidates for president and were very critical of Trump, The Washington Post reported. Biden's strong support among African-Americans also was evident earlier this year when he pulled off a resounding victory in\u00a0South Carolina that revived his then-struggling candidacy. Johnson, the first black billionaire in the United States, underscored the significance at this moment of the\u00a0Black Lives Matter movement that has swept the nation in the wake of George Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis, Minn. He said he's \"never seen a\u00a0group this strong\u00a0since the civil rights movement.\" Johnson disagrees with some of the efforts by BLM and its allies, calling defunding the police a \"silly idea\" and mocking\u00a0\"borderline anarchists\" who want to topple statues of Confederate and historical figures. But he sees the need for a group to stand up with the sole purpose of fighting for African-Americans because he said the Democratic Party hasn't delivered on mending the systemic wealth gap between white and black Americans. Johnson is a major proponent of $14 trillion in slavery reparations\u00a0payments to African-Americans. \"No minority group has ever achieved significant power in a two-party system when they are locked into one party and considered unreachable by the other party,\" Johnson said. Johnson said the permanent interests of African-Americans have diverged in many ways with the Democratic Party;\u00a0now, with the nation behind the Black Lives Matter movement and racial injustice at the forefront,\u00a0it's time to act. \"I propose that an independent party formed by Black Lives Matter should echo the founding principles of the original Congressional Black Caucus members in 1971 who ... said black Americans should have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests,\" Johnson said. Johnson suggested that\u00a0Black Lives Matter run\u00a0candidates for various offices\u00a0and leverage their power in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where black voters staying home or breaking with Democrats\u00a0can determine the outcome of the presidential election. He recently publicized this idea in an open letter to the BLM movement. BET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON MOCKS CROWDS PULLING DOWN STATUES, CALLS THEM 'BORDERLINE ANARCHISTS' \"It is very possible a black vote\u00a0at 12 percent\u00a0going one way toward\u00a0Donald Trump could make Donald Trump president,\" Johnson said. \"That's leverage, and black Americans ought to recognize the leverage.\" Johnson considers himself a lifelong Democrat and was a Hillary Clinton backer, but he's undecided in the 2020 race between Biden and Trump. He's\u00a0given Trump high praise for his handling of the economy and boosting black employment.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \"He took on one of the biggest issues facing African-Americans -- unemployment, and therefore lack of income and therefore the wealth gap,\" said Johnson, who met Trump at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club in 2016. \"He addressed that and put a lot of African-Americans to work and in a way that was more historic than it's ever been. And I applauded him.\" Johnson said he'll determine his vote in November based on which candidate\u00a0will do the best for African-Americans, adding: \"I have not made up my mind.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP He said Latinos and white voters are routinely\u00a0split among the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, so Johnson challenges\u00a0the idea that black voters should continually vote in a bloc for Democrats. He said he's \"not intimidated\" by any pressure that he needs to vote with Democrats. \"To do that is absolute total cowardice,\" Johnson said of buying into that thinking. \"And you're giving in to somebody controlling your mind and controlling your vote, which is not something I will ever bow to.\"",

The backdrop of a summer of civil unrest in America\u2019s largest cities and the\u00a0ongoing coronavirus pandemic looms large as motivated voters prepare to submit their ballots for president in less\u00a0than two weeks. Police departments \u2013 many of which saw days, weeks and even monthslong anti-police brutality protests and riots this summer \u2013 said they are hoping for the best when voters hit the polls on Nov. 3, but are also preparing for the worst in the days before and after.

(Photo by Volkan Furuncu/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) \u201cThere is no secret that this election is more contentious than in years\u2019 past,\u201d said New York Police Department\u2019s Chief of Department, Terence Monahan, during a Tuesday press conference covering election preparedness. The NYPD is one of many departments throughout the country with a plan in case any protests devolve into criminal activity. THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COMES DOWN TO THESE 9 STATES Chicago, much like New York City, has seen spurts of civil unrest, including devastating looting downtown. Its police department is now working with several city agencies in a coordinated effort to be prepared for any fallout, whether at the polls or on the streets, during the election period. Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said at a recent news conference that\u00a0police and emergency officials are training to make sure they\u2019re ready \u201cregardless of whatever scenario happens on Election Day.\u201d Police officers inspect a damaged Best Buy store in Chicago after parts of the city suffered from widespread looting and vandalism over the summer. (Getty Images) \u201cMany cities across the country are doing similar planning,\u201d he said last week. \u201cWe are all in conversations with our counterparts across the country about what we might expect, but everything is uncertain, and so we\u2019re trying as best we can to anticipate any hazard that might happen, including a weather hazard, snow might happen in our city, along with anything related to protests, embedded agitators that might loot or cause violence or destroy property.\u201d THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2020 BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS Even without the prevalent unrest in certain parts of the country, this year\u2019s election will nonetheless look different. People have the option of voting early and by mail, and officials anticipate clear results might take days, if not weeks. Here are what some police departments in big cities have to say about their plans to best ensure every American stays safe before, during\u00a0and after Election Day. Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina told Fox News this week that it was\u00a0\u201cdifficult to tell\u201d what kind of unrest -\u00a0if any -\u00a0the city will face in the days leading up to the election. \u201cWe're going to have more people working, a bigger, more robust uniformed presence. And then we're going to have some undercover officers that will go by polling places,\u201d he said. Colina said the city will also be prepared with groups of officers who\u00a0could mobilize at short notice, \u201cespecially those groups that want to create havoc.\u201d He told Fox News he believes the protests could look different depending on who is ultimately elected president. \"This state [Florida] is up for grabs, according to the polls. This is a state that both candidates covet, obviously, and that's always been the case,\u201d he said. \u201cI can't help but wonder that if that's not going to inspire some fringe groups to want to do their part to win it for one or the other. And that's where it gets a little dangerous because people, you know, they become extreme.\u201d His concerns, he said, are not based on any credible threats, but he plans to be ready, nonetheless. \u201cI know that these kinds of things exist, right? Where people want to come out and they want to create an issue and then blame it on the other. I mean, we've seen that, we've seen that. So I'm hoping that that's not the case again,\u201d Colina said. \u201cAgain, I think we're gonna be fine, but I recognize that, certainly, that could happen because this state is up for grabs.\u201d City of Miami police officers gear up as they prepare for any problems with protesters Sunday, May 31, 2020, in Miami. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) During a press conference on Monday, Colina said the department had canceled vacation days and days off during the election period, and will\u00a0deploy additional officers. The department has also instructed every sworn officer, whether assigned to a desk job or patrol duty, to bring their uniform to work in case a greater police presence is needed. \u201cThe truth is, this is a very contentious election cycle. Unlike we haven\u2019t seen in many, many years,\u201d he said during the news conference. \u201cWe have a very savvy community here who understands that some people may want to take actions into their own hands and try to, and swing some votes. We just want to make sure that we don\u2019t allow that to take place.\u201d Said to be the largest police force in the nation, the NYPD is directing its officers to be \u201cprepared for deployment\u201d beginning Oct. 26, as it\u00a0braces for increasing protests in the lead-up to and following Election Day 2020, according to an internal memo from Oct. 13\u00a0obtained by Fox News. NYPD brass are planning for potential civil unrest as New York City\u00a0and the nation begin a contentious series of weeks, starting with the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and coupled with the upcoming presidential election, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in the\u00a0internal announcement. \u201cThis November 3rd will be the (sic) one of the most highly contested presidential elections in the modern era,\u201d Shea wrote, noting that Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearing was set to begin at the same time of the missive's release. \u201cAccordingly, we should anticipate and prepare for protests growing in size, frequency, and intensity leading up to the election and likely into the year 2021.\u201d Shea also noted that the election winner \u201cmay not be decided for several weeks,\u201d and the confirmation hearing was also expected to continue for weeks. During an interview later that day, Shea told local news station NY1 that the department wanted to be ready for anything.

In some instances, significant damage was done to local businesses, which did not change the election outcome, but hurt our community members,\u201d the release states. \u201cWhile we promote and support the exercise of the First Amendment rights to assemble and engage in free speech, engagement in criminal activity will not be tolerated.\u201d PPB officials said they will not tolerate any demonstrators blocking pedestrian and vehicular traffic, lighting fires, \u201cvandalizing and damaging property,\u201d illegal use of weapons and violence. \u201cWe're just trying to prepare and coordinate to increase safety during that time,\" Officer Derek Carmon, a PPB spokesperson, told Fox News on Monday. \"We've seen in the past where people come out because they're either excited about the election results or they're completely unhappy with the election results and they come down causing damage and things like that in the past. So we're just trying to be prepared for that by having more officers available.\" Carmon said the department is not allowing officers to take any vacation days during and in the days following the election period, but had not established specific requirements of personnel during that time. PPB Chief Chuck Lovell said in a prepared statement\u00a0that this election season \u201chas increased fear and uncertainty for many of our community members.\u201d \u201cWe want our community to know we are prioritizing public safety by adding resources and collaboration during this important time. We ask for the public to help us by reporting criminal activity, staying informed, and engaging in lawful activities. Together, we can achieve a safe election season in Portland,\u201d Lovell said.

In gearing up for the election period, Seattle Police Department set a limit to the time off allowed for personnel around the time of Election Day \u201cto ensure the department is able to adequately provide public safety services at any events, gatherings or demonstrations related to the election,\u201d said SPD spokesperson Sgt. Randall Huserik. Huserik also said SPD recently launched its Community Response Group, to \u201cdynamically deploy to unplanned large-scale events and ensure SPD is able to quickly respond to 911 emergencies,\u201d in case such a response is needed. Though not particularly known for experiencing unrest in recent months, Orlando Police Department officials are working with the Supervisor of Elections office to ensure the election period goes smoothly, Sgt. David Baker, a spokesperson for OPD told Fox News. \u201cThe Supervisor of Elections does have a protocol in place to contact law enforcement if individuals are disruptive and unruly and violating Florida statutes related to voting, including the 150-foot no-solicitation zone near the entrance of polling places,\u201d Baker wrote in an emailed statement. Additional information was not provided. In this May 29, 2020, photo, a check-cashing business burns during protests in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Minneapolis is also no stranger to civil unrest, which rocked the city\u00a0in the wake of the alleged police-related\u00a0death of local resident, George Floyd. Floyd, a Black man, died at the end of May after a White police officer held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, despite his shouts that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Days of protests and destruction in the city followed. Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s public information officer, John Elder, said in an email to Fox News the department continues to \u201cplan for the worst and hope for the best.\u201d \u201cWe are aware of current and future possible flashpoints that present challenges on both a local and national level,\u201d Elder said. \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, local, regionally, and federally in order to properly respond to situations as they unfold.\u00a0 Additionally, we are keeping lines of communication open with the communities we serve and working with everyone we can to ensure 1st Amendment rights are preserved and providing a safe environment for all.\u201d Elder could not provide any more specific details regarding the department\u2019s plans. Superintendent David Brown said during a press conference earlier this month that the police department and several other city agencies have\u00a0scheduled several tabletop exercises in the lead-up to Election Day to ensure officials were prepared for whatever might happen. The department, he said, was \u201cmaking sure that we are in our neighborhoods in a very strong posture to make sure our, not only our First Amendment, but that our assets, that our critical infrastructure, that our retail corridors are all protected from any wrongdoers.\u201d Just months ago, caravans of looters descended upon Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile, where they looted and destroyed property just hours after allegedly false information about a police-involved shooting spread.\u00a0The looters coordinated their efforts through social media, Brown said at the time. The police department has now prepared for similar instances, as well as any other election-related crimes, by assigning specific groups to oversee protests and protect \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d Brown said at last week\u2019s election-related press conference. CPD has also extended certain officers\u2019 shifts and canceled the days off for those members who have been assigned to the specific teams, he said. Brown noted that he believed there was a \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d during summer protests \u201cto embed agitators\u201d within the otherwise peaceful demonstrations. He\u2019s planning, he said, in case that\u2019s also a feature of election-related protests. \u201cSo from those lessons learned from over the summer, we are planning for that to be a feature of peaceful protests: a slight embedment of people who have no intention of protesting but every intention of committing crime,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo, instead of being caught off-guard we are planning for that to happen and we have operations in place to ensure that they don\u2019t destroy property, that they don\u2019t cause any further violence and that they\u2019re held accountable.\u201d Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in a statement provided to Fox News that the department is working with city agencies to protect the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the election. On the local level, Philly PD and other agencies are preparing \u201cfor all possible scenarios for Election Day,\u201d whether before, during or after, she wrote. In addition to working with federal prosecutors, Outlaw said PPD will be \u201cembedding Assistant District Attorneys with our officers to work as co-respondents, if called upon.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cWe will ensure enhanced security measures, conduct advance training and ensure adequate staffing are present throughout the election operation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is paramount to myself, the Mayor, and the City Commissioners that we coordinate a unified command group, protecting the community for election safety.\u201d Stephanie Pagones is a Digital Reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

            "article_content": " America went insane over the weekend. That's barely an overstatement. People in their 80s who have lived in the U.S. all their lives said they've never seen anything like it. Ask an 80-year-old. This was without precedent in the modern era. A\u00a0small group of highly aggressive emotionally charged activists took over our culture. They forced the entire country to obey their will. It all happened so fast and with such ferocity that virtually no one resisted it. NAACP PRESIDENT DECLINES TO ENDORSE \u2018DEFUND POLICE\u2019 MOVEMENT People seem bewildered, even stunned by what was happening. Statements of fact and opinion that were entirely within the bounds of reasonable conversation just last Sunday, suddenly, a week later, were enough to get you fired from your job. And a number of people were fired. An awful lot happened this weekend. We want to assess the aftermath of it all, suggest what it may mean, and where this country is likely to go from here. But first, we want to give you a sense of what happened. We're going to begin in Minneapolis, where the Black Lives Matter riots first began almost two weeks ago. As the violence there raged, some Democratic leaders in Minneapolis came to a conclusion that\u00a0didn't, on the surface anyway, make intuitive sense. What their city really needs, they decided, is less law enforcement -- in fact, no law enforcement. So, they began to demand that Minneapolis \"defund the police.\" Now, the first thing you notice about this idea is how unpopular with the public it is. Almost nobody in the country supports it. But the activists, undeterred, kept pushing the idea, and within days, pressure mounted on the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, to get rid of his city's police department. This was a problem for Frey. Frey has greater political aspirations. And this was the last conversation he wanted to have. So, Frey did his best to change the subject with a mix of manic enthusiasm, and feigned empathy. Frey is well-practiced in those areas. Here he is a couple of years ago with his preferred brand of community outreach - dancing with his constituents. It didn't work -- then or now. Activists wanted actual answers. So Mayor Frey tried step two in the process -- groveling. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: I've been coming to grips with my own brokenness in this situation, my own failures, my own shortcomings and I know there needs to be deep-seated -- Unidentified female: [Expletive] Again, good try, \"brokenness.\" It sounds like a sermon; give a raise to the staffer who scripted that. But again, no dice. Black Lives Matter, to their credit, wanted a real answer to their question. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It was then that Jacob Frey made a fatal mistake. He put himself in a position where he could be asked that question directly. Here is what happened next? Unidentified male: ... Reelection next year. If he says no, that's what [bleep] we're going to do next. Unidentified female: Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? Frey: The abolition of it? Unidentified female: What did I say? We don't want no more police. Frey: No more. Unidentified female: Is that clear? Frey: I do not support the full abolition of the police department. Unidentified female: [Expletive]. You're wasting our time. Get the [expletive] out of here. Crowd (chanting): Go home, Jacob. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. What a remarkable piece of tape that is. Has a big city mayor in this country ever been more thoroughly humiliated? \"Get the F\u00a0out of here,\" she screams. \"Go!\" Well, the correct answer to that, needless to say, is, \"Up yours, lady. I'm not going anywhere. I run this city.\" Do you doubt that the entire crowd would have cheered Jacob Frey if he had said that? People always admire resolve even when they disagree with the point of view. But that's not what Jacob Frey did. Frey slunk away like a child caught doing something filthy. The most telling moment, though, came just before that, when the woman in sunglasses threatened to defeat the mayor in the next election. What does that tell you? It tells you that Black Lives Matter is in fact a political party, maybe the strongest political party in the United States. Its members believe they can reshape this country and so far, they're proving to be right. You can always tell which political movements are ascendant, which are headed up, by how straightforward their members and sympathizers are about what they believe. Strong people say what they think out loud. They have no reason not to. They're not embarrassed about their beliefs. They think they're winning. In the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy. With that in mind, watch this clip from CNN Monday morning. This is the president of the Minneapolis City Council, Lisa Bender. Bender explains that the desire for safety, the desire not to, for example, have your home invaded by violent criminals, is in fact a sign of racism. Alisyn Camerota, CNN anchor: Do you understand that the word \"dismantle\" or \"police-free\" also makes some people nervous. For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home is broken into. Who do I call? Lisa Bender, president of the Minneapolis City Council: Yes. I\u00a0mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done. \"Hello, police?\u00a0Armed men are breaking into my home. Help!\"\u00a0\"Shut up, racist. Click.\" That's the world Lisa Bender is calling for. How many people watching CNN this morning as they got dressed agreed with Lisa Bender? Sure, that sounds reasonable. Calling the police during a break-in definitely qualifies as racism. It's hard to believe even among CNN's audience that very many people thought that --\u00a0 it's so obviously nuts. On the other hand, it doesn't really matter at this point what the public thinks about anything. In the case of this idea, many Democratic leaders are already sold on it. Here's former congressman Keith Ellison on MSNBC over the weekend. Keep in mind as you watch him speak that Ellison is now the chief law enforcement officer in Minnesota. He is the attorney general. Ellison argues that it's wrong for police to bring guns to domestic violence calls. Seriously. Keith Ellison, attorney general of Minnesota: We send out people with guns, and they are there to use deadly force no matter what the problem may be. If the problem is sexual assault, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is domestic violence, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is somebody with a mental health crisis, we send somebody with a gun. Okay, we know what you're thinking. That's Keith Ellison, kind of an unfair example. Ellison has long been a crazy person who was once attached to the Nation of Islam. Back then, he called himself Keith Hakeem. More recently, Ellison endorsed Antifa. Yes, that's all true. But unlike other race-baiting extremists, Keith Ellison may have a promising political future. It's very easy to imagine it. If Joe Biden wins, Keith Ellison could be the attorney general of the United States. At the very least, he would be first in line to become U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota, the top federal prosecutor there. What would happen then? We may live to find out. Again, all of this probably strikes you as wild-eyed craziness, flat Earth stuff. Eliminate the police? Really? But things change fast. Look how quickly they changed just over the weekend. Democrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a skilled trend spotter if there ever was one, is already acting as if defund the police -- again, a proposal that no sane person even mentioned in public just last month -- is now the defining civil rights issue of our time. You'd have to be a bigoted dinosaur, a bad person, to oppose it. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.: This is one of those moments. This, right now, is one of those moments. So, if you're an elected official that for any reason is on this call, I'm asking you to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice to make sure that overfunded police departments are defunded? So think about what you just saw. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't just a member of Congress. She is maybe\u00a0the most famous member of Congress. She is also a surrogate for Joe Biden. So, a lot is on the line here. Ocasio-Cortez didn't say that accidentally. She had a reason for saying it. Why did she say that? What is going on here? Well, as usual, the truth bears no resemblance whatsoever to what they're telling you. Think about it for just a second. Democratic politicians control the police departments of virtually every big city in this country. Now, they're telling you they want to get rid of those police departments. If they did, that would mean less power for themselves. So, right away, you know, there's lying going on. Democrats do not relinquish power voluntarily, ever.\u00a0Period. Republicans frequently do. Democrats never do. So, that's the first thing to know. Something obviously is going on here beneath the surface. This has to be an attempt to increase the power of the Democratic Party because every policy they push is always. And in fact, that's exactly what's happening here. Democrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump. That's what's actually happening here, and it makes sense. Law enforcement is one of the very few institutions remaining in this country that the left has not yet controlled. Democrats hate the police because they don't control the police. Very simple. Remember 35 years ago when Democrats were constantly attacking the U.S. military? We don't hear that anymore. Why is that? It's very simple. The left took over the Pentagon. No reason to attack people you control, which they do. And they plan to do the same thing to your local police department. Let's be clear: What Democrats are proposing isn't some form of radical libertarianism with the cops leaving citizens to police their own neighborhoods. No, it's the opposite of that. What they're proposing is a power grab. Defund the police is a move toward authoritarian social control, cloaked in the language of identity politics. Already, in the middle of a total breakdown of law and order as we watch our cities burn, you are seeing new moves to prevent you from defending yourself and your family in the middle of it. Just last Tuesday, Marjorie Greene, who is running for Congress in Georgia, posted this ad on Facebook and within two days, Facebook pulled it down. Marjorie Greene, running for Georgia's 14th Congressional District: I have a message for Antifa terrorists. Stay the hell out of Northwest Georgia. You won't burn our churches, loot our businesses or destroy our homes. Here's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country. So, Facebook has a policy against violence --n not the violence engulfing our cities, but the violence of you defending your family. They create the chaos, you're not allowed to defend yourself. You are, in other words -- and this is, of course, the point -- wholly dependent upon them. In the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy. Imagine if the Diversity Inclusion Department at Brown University had the power to arrest you. Imagine if the Black Lives Matter rioters had weapons and immunity from prosecution. That's what they're talking about. Partisan law enforcement and partisan law enforcement, incidentally, is hardly without precedent. In fact, it's the rule in the third world. This is an attempt to bring it here. What is again striking is how few American voters support this, very few. Polling from just a week ago shows that only 16 percent of Americans favored cutting funding to police departments. There was almost no party divide on that question surprisingly. The numbers were virtually the same for Republicans and Democrats. The divide was economic. If you make more than $100,000.00 a year, you are more than twice as likely to think cutting the police was a good idea. And there's no mystery there, of course; rich people live in safe places. They can afford their own security. Jeff Bezos doesn't need the police, he has got his own. Unfortunately for the rest of us -- and it is unfortunate --\u00a0\u00a0Jeff Bezos and people like him are the only ones allowed to talk right now. It's hard to overstate how vicious the crackdown on free speech and free thought has been in the last few days. Here's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country. In Vancouver, a men's basketball coach was fired for liking a tweet that questioned Black Lives Matter. Meanwhile, a player on the LA Galaxy -- that's the professional soccer team in Los Angeles -- was fired because his wife said something critical online. Not him, he didn't do it. His wife. It doesn't matter. They canned the player anyway. Imagine being a high school student right now. High school students who refuse to show affirmative support for Black Lives Matter on their Instagram accounts were shunned by their friends. Journalists who asked too many questions about the group were fired or silenced. Again, not an exaggeration. Now, you'd think people in the media would resent this; presumably, some do. But almost everybody stayed quiet about it. They were too afraid, and some applauded. The New York Times\u00a0ran an op-ed demanding that people disown their own families if their families failed to support Black Lives Matter enthusiastically enough. \"Tell your relatives, tell your friends,\" the author wrote .\"You will not be visiting or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives through protest or financial contributions.\" Got that? Sorry, mom. I know you're old and alone and miss your grandchildren. But we are shunning you until you send more money to Black Lives Matter. In an environment like this -- we've never lived in an environment like this. But you can imagine, in an environment like this, most people get the message very fast and the weak ones are quick to join in just like the good l Red Guards they have always been underneath it all. Here's Mitt Romney on the march. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah: We need to end violence and brutality and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter. Mitt just wants to make sure that Americans understand, get through their thick heads, that black lives matter, as if Americans didn't know that. But accusing your entire country of racism turns out to be a pretty small price for someone like Mitt Romney. What Romney is really worried about -- what all the finance moguls funding this movement are worried about -- is that someone somewhere will ask the obvious questions. How much have you, Mitt Romney personally made? How rich have you become by sending jobs overseas -- working-class jobs? By charging obscene interest rates and by otherwise harming poor and black communities economically? All the basic crimes are economic. Mitt Romney doesn't want to talk about that at all. So he marches. And Black Lives Matter couldn't be happier about it. The complicity of people like Mitt Romney gives groups like Black Lives Matter strength. Black Lives Matter is becoming more powerful by the hour and they know it. Watch this interview from Saturday in which a Black Lives Matter activist cheerfully admits he may soon incinerate people with gasoline. Activist: I am a leader of this FTP Movement. It means a lot of things. It can mean \"free the people.\" It can be \"for the people.\" It can also mean \"fire to property.\" We hope in de Blasio and Cuomo -- come on, talk to us and give the youth some direction. But if they don't, then next up is a Diamond District, and gasoline, thanks to Trump, is awfully cheap. The amazing thing is not just that he said that, though that's shocking enough. The amazing thing is that he said it on television live. He wasn't worried about being arrested. He's not like you at all. You're still not allowed to attend church services or go to big weddings. Too bad you're not friends with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. You could do anything. If this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing? Bowser has renamed a park near the White House \"Black Lives Matter Plaza,\" and nobody criticized her for it. MSNBC practically sent her flowers. Jonathan Capehart, Washington Post editorial writer: Having a mural, Black Lives Matter, in huge block letters across three blocks leading up to the White House. As I said to you on Sunday, badass move that you made. Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser: The Black Lives Matter mural is a representation of an expression of our saying no, but also identifying and claiming a part of our city that had been taken over by federal forces. Mayor Bowser was buoyed and gratified by the support she received from our friends over on MSNBC, so she also had Black Lives Matter painted in enormous yellow letters on 16th Street in downtown D.C. Kind of a bold move if you think about it, making a street partisan. Imagine a big city mayor naming a major thoroughfare NRA Avenue or Planned Parenthood Boulevard. You think they would say something about it? It's impressive, in a way, but Black Lives Matter wasn't satisfied by it, not even close. The D.C. Chapter of the group released a statement attacking Mayor Bowser for not giving them complete control of the city's police department: \"This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\" Got that? Black Lives Matter means defund the police. Oh, so that's what Black Lives Matter means. No one really explains that. That's their description, and now we know what Intel and Pepsi and Amazon are supporting when they send money -- defunding the police. Suddenly, it feels like all the adults have gone to St. Barts and turned off their cell phones. Who is running this country? Who is in charge? Anyone? Yet, amazingly, some Republicans in Washington seem almost giddy as they watch the country go insane. Democrats have gone too far this time, they'll tell you. We're guaranteed to win in November. You've probably gotten texts to that effect recently from friends. It sounds good, but they are wrong. They're totally and completely wrong on many levels. For one thing, if you care about it, a country, you've got to try. You have an obligation to try your very best to protect and defend it, no matter who is helped in November. That's what patriotism is. It's not about you, it's about America. But leave aside your moral duty, even as a matter of pure politics. This is a mindless analysis. It is a stupid calculation. Bad ideas are like cancer. When you ignore them, when you pretend they're not there, when you just assume, just ride it out, they spread. Most people, as we noted, currently oppose defunding the police. That's where the polls stand right now. But will they feel that way in three months? How about in three weeks? In an environment like this, you don't know. Things move fast. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell once opposed mocking the American flag, kneeling to attack the country as\u00a0racist. Now, Goodell has announced, he is with Black Lives Matter. Roger Goodell, NFL Commissioner: We at the National Football League admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We at the National Football League believe Black Lives Matter. I personally protest with you. So, if this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing? And that's not a small thing if you plan to live here. If you don't want to live under Attorney General Keith Ellison, so why is it happening? Maybe it's because Republicans in Washington have decided to sit this crisis out. They haven't bothered to explain what's wrong. They haven't bothered to tell us anything about what might be flawed about Black Lives Matter, and they don't plan to by the way. They're too cynical. They're too fearful. If Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods. They're going to pretend like it's not happening, repeat platitudes. Read bumper stickers on the air, nod solemnly and do nothing to protect the country. Why would voters reward that? Democrats, by contrast, who are completely wrong, and in fact are leading us down a path that won't end well, are not ashamed in the slightest of what they believe. Day in and day out, they brag about it. Just on Monday, they kneeled in Washington in submission before Black Lives Matter. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We are here to honor George Floyd. For those who wish to, we will now kneel for our moment of silence. Nancy Pelosi doing something crazy again. Before you comfort yourself with that thought, keep in mind it wasn't just Nancy Pelosi, not by a longshot. Members of the National Guard kneeled, too. So did a group of FBI agents. So did the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who just the other day was wearing blackface. Now, he is with Black Lives Matter. The police chief of Webster, Massachusetts went even further than that. He lay on the ground before them in complete submission. And then things began to spin completely out of control, not just in this country but throughout the West. As the crowd swelled, and the demand for total ideological conformity grew louder, this latest cultural revolution became a parody of itself, as they always do. Tell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us. Immigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not. In London, protesters vandalized the statue of Abraham Lincoln -- because what did Abraham Lincoln ever do for black people? In Boston, a mob defaced a monument to the first all-black volunteer regiment in the Civil War.\u00a0Because black people dying to end slavery sounds like white supremacy to us. Right around the same time, a law professor from the University of Chicago called for an armed coup to overthrow the president of the United States, but that didn't get a lot of press because it didn't seem particularly newsworthy under the circumstances. It was that kind of weekend. What is going on? What is this about? Even the outlines are blurry at this point, but we know this: No matter what they tell you, it has very little to do with black lives. If only it did. If Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods. They would instead do their very best to improve the public schools and to encourage intact families, which we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is central to the life prospects of children. If they tried to make black neighborhoods as safe as their own neighborhoods, they would close the payday lenders that have added so much misery to the lives of poor people of all colors. But they don't even consider doing any of this -- they don't even try. Instead, they encourage theft and mayhem as if that will help. It will not help. This may be a lot of things, this moment we're living through, but it is definitely not about black lives, and remember that when they come for you. And at this rate, they will. Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It's like being swarmed by hornets. You cannot think clearly. And the temptation is to panic. But you can't panic. You've got to keep your head and tell the truth. Tell the truth. If you show weakness of any kind, they will crush you. Ask Drew Brees. By some accounts, poor Drew Brees is on his fourth apology for the crime of defending the American flag. He decided to apologize and now, they are using him as a propaganda work in hostage tape after hostage tape. At a moment like this, there is no advantage in cowardice, in being Mitt Romney. You think you're saving yourself? You're just empowering the worst people -- people who hate you. Before you know it, you're confessing to crimes you didn't commit. Don't start. Tell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us. Immigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not. That's all true. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And in our clear moments, we know it's true, even the people claiming it's not. Truth is a defense. No matter what they're telling you at this moment, this moment will pass. Remember that. All moments do. When it does, we will look back at what we just saw in horror and disbelief. But if you're honest now, you will keep your dignity, and ultimately you will be very glad about that. Life is not worth living without it.

            "article_content": "Raw video: Group of protesters in D.C. demonstrating against the shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin surround a woman who wouldn't raise her fist in solidarity and chant, 'White silence is violence.' Videos of Black Lives Matter protesters screaming at people as they dine outside in the nation\u2019s capital have gone viral this week, as protests picked up steam nationwide\u00a0following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wis., on Sunday. Frederick Kunkle, a Washington Post staff writer, posted a video Tuesday on Twitter that showed a crowd of protesters gathering closely around a woman, identified as Lauren Victor, as she sat outside on a sidewalk. The group demanded she raise her fist in solidarity as they\u00a0chanted at her, \u201cWhite silence is violence,\u201d and, \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d One woman asked her, demandingly, \u201cAre you a Christian?\u201d Other diners appeared to raise their fists, but Victor did not. She appeared to try\u00a0reasoning with the crowd, raising her arms in seeming disbelief. Kunkle reported that after the confrontation, a citizen journalist named Chuck Modiano asked her, \u201cWhat was in you, you couldn\u2019t do this?\u201d Victor responded that she felt she was under attack. \u201cIn the moment, it didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Kunkle reported that Victor said, adding that she felt like there was something wrong about being forced to raise her fist. \u201cI\u2019m very much with them. I\u2019ve been marching with them for weeks and weeks and weeks.\u201d MANHUNT FOR GUNMAN LAUNCHED AFTER 2 KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN KENOSHA Modiano tweeted\u00a0Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t part of the group screaming at Victor, and that he had a cordial 20-minute conversation with her after the crowd dispersed. However,\u00a0Kunkle reported\u00a0that Modiano was yelling at Victor. Many people on social media noted that the protesters visible in the video confronting Victor were almost all White. Kunkle posted a follow-up video that showed a young Black woman asking White protesters to lead the way confronting Victor. MOM OF JACOB BLAKE PLEADS FOR PEACE IN KENOSHA AFTER POLICE SHOOTING Another video that went viral Monday showed a man and a woman sitting outside a restaurant when a crowd of protesters confronted them.

Peaceful protests against racial injustice are critical for the nation's progress and help to keep law enforcement in check, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said\u00a0Friday. \"Nothing that we have achieved that has been about progress, in particular around civil rights, has come without a fight, and so I always am going to interpret these protests as an essential component of evolution in our country -- as an essential component or\u00a0mark of a real democracy,\" the vice presidential nominee\u00a0said during the NAACP's national convention. She added that protests were \"necessary\" as \"the people's voices must be heard, and it is often the people who must speak to get their government to do what it is supposed to do, but may not do naturally unless the people speak loudly -- and obviously peacefully.\" Harris also praised the \"brilliance\" and \"impact\" of \"Black Lives Matter,\" which has received media praise but also come under fire for promoting left-wing stances like opposing the nuclear family. \"I actually believe that 'Black Lives Matter'\u00a0has been the most significant agent for change within the criminal justice system,\" she said. HERSCHEL WALKER APPLAUDS BIDEN OVER LOUISVILLE VIOLENCE RESPONSE, CHALLENGES HARRIS Her comments came during mass protests surrounding the deaths of Black Americans like Breonna Taylor, whose case prompted a series of demonstrations earlier this week. While the vast majority of demonstrations -- which began in late May -- have been peaceful, some have resulted in property destruction. Footage quickly emerged purportedly showing buildings vandalized and burned in Louisville, Ky., after a grand jury decided to indict just one of the officers involved in Taylor's death. Across the country, violent confrontations during these demonstrations\u00a0have led to deaths and injuries, including for demonstrators, journalists and police officers.\u00a0In Louisville, Kentucky, two officers were shot, and subsequently hospitalized, during protests surrounding Taylor's case. Former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats have been criticized for allegedly not doing enough to denounce violent demonstrations, while President's Trump campaign has attempted to tie their statements to on-going riots. FLASHBACK: KAMALA HARRIS SAID NATIONWIDE PROTESTS ARE 'NOT GOING TO STOP' In May, Biden released a statement in which he distinguished between violent and peaceful protests. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cProtesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not,\u201d the statement read. At the end of last month, Sen. Harris similarly said:\u00a0\"We must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder. Make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice.\"",

Two teenagers are the latest to face terrorism charges after allegedly helping to break in the windows of an Oklahoma\u00a0City bail bonds business in late May during the civil unrest that swept the nation in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Several dozen protesters conducted a sit-in at the office of Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater on Monday to demand that he\u00a0drop the terrorism charges and resign. But Prater maintained last week that those who incite violence in the streets are \u201ccriminals\u201d who \u201chave subverted peaceful protests and impaired the open discussion regarding race in our country.\u201d \u201cWhen you employ these tactics for a political purpose, you are a terrorist,\u201d he said.

The bombing was the worst terrorist attack to take place on U.S. soil until that on the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001. \u201cTo conflate acts of vandalism against property with acts of terrorist violence against human beings is a moral and legal equivocation without compare,\u201d its petition on Change.org said. \u201cIt is an insult to survivors of terrorism and it is a sacrilege to its victims. Please join us in condemning these charges and demanding that [Oklahoma County]\u00a0District Attorney David Prater dismiss them without delay.\u201d VIOLENCE ESCALATES OVERNIGHT BETWEEN FEDS, PROTESTERS AFTER THOUSANDS MARCH IN DOWNTOWN PORTLAND Haley Lin Crawford and Sydney Lynch, who both turned 18 within the past month, were charged last week with acting with a large crowd to unlawfully break the windows of CJ's Bail Bonds in Oklahoma City on May 30, the Oklahoman reported. The charges came after investigators identified the two young women using Facebook Live video streamed by other demonstrators and tips to CrimeStoppers. An anonymous article posted on Medium.com on Tuesday said Prater \u201cchose to charge those demonstrating their First Amendment Constitutional rights with terrorism.\u201d \u201cThese charges carry a $1 million bond, meaning innocent Oklahomans are left to suffer in Oklahoma County Jail, which is routinely ranked as one of the worst jails in the nation,\u201d the post said. \u201cPrater even arrested a child on their 18th birthday \u2014 and is awaiting the 18th birthday of additional demonstrators to throw into jail.\u201d At least three others had been charged with terrorism after the May 30 incident. Isael Antonio Ortiz, 21, of Welch, was indicted on two terrorism counts for allegedly first setting fire to an Oklahoma County sheriff\u2019s van before then trying to burn down CJ's Bail Bonds, the Oklahoman reported. Eric Christopher Ruffin, 26, of Oklahoma City, was charged with terrorism and accused of encouraging \u201cwanton destruction\u201d by recording himself helping Ortiz set the sheriff\u2019s van ablaze. Malachai Davis, 18, of Edmond, was also charged with terrorism after investigators identified him on Facebook Live footage breaking the window of CJ Bail Bond\u2019s using what appeared to be brass knuckles. His\u00a0attorney, David McKenzie, called the charges against his client ironic given\u00a0Davis\u2019 own father died in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. And at least six others have been charged with rioting. At least one has been charged with assault and battery against a police officer during the civil unrest that same May night. \u201cIt is concerning and bewildering that this organization has chosen to defend criminals who are violent, exploitive and unscrupulous,\u201d Prater said in a lengthy statement last week, referring to Black Lives Matter. \u201cThese criminals have subverted peaceful protests and impaired the open discussion regarding race in our country,\u201d he continued, according to KFOR. \u201cThese criminals are diabolic and strategic in their use of tactics historically employed by terrorists throughout the world; namely, targeting innocent citizens with violence and the threat of violence, intimidation, the dissemination of propaganda to disrupt societal and communal relationships and using peaceful protestors as human shields. \u201cWhen you employ these tactics for a political purpose, you are a terrorist,\u201d Prater said. \u201cNo individual or organization will intimidate me or law enforcement from protecting those we serve by aggressively enforcing and prosecuting the law. When you act like a terrorist, you will be treated like a terrorist. All innocent citizens of Oklahoma County deserve to be protected. The citizens of Oklahoma County have a legal and constitutional right to personal safety and the protection of their property.

A police press conference in a suburban Chicago\u00a0area on Wednesday regarding the death of a Black teenager during\u00a0an officer-involved shooting\u00a0the night before attracted protesters and hecklers, who repeatedly shouted over a police commander trying to explain what happened. Standing with a small crowd behind him, Waukegan Police Commander Edgar Navarro explained how a White police officer was investigating a suspicious occupied vehicle in the area of Liberty Street and Oak Street at about 11:55 p.m. Tuesday. He said the vehicle then fled the area. A second officer, who is Hispanic, located the vehicle in the area of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and South Avenue. Navarro said the officer exited his own vehicle, and at that point, the vehicle he was investigating began to reverse. The officer then fired into the vehicle, striking both occupants. ELECTION 2020: POLICE IN CITIES NATIONWIDE BRACING FOR POTENTIAL UNREST IN DAYS BEFORE, AFTER NOV. 3 \u201cWhy would he fire? Why would he fire?\u201d a woman is heard shouting in the footage, standing off-camera. Despite the interruption, Navarro continued to explain the female driver, identified by authorities as a Black woman in her 20s, was taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds and is expected to recover. \u201cWhy did they shoot them though?\u201d says another person. Navarro said the male passenger, a Black teenager, was taken to an area hospital, where he died. \u201cHe was dead\u2026 he was dead on the scene,\u201d someone shouts before others join in. Some in the crowd appear to quiet the others so Navarro could finish in saying the Waukegan Police Department turned over all materials to Illinois State Police, who is conducting an independent investigation. The crowd erupted once more, this time with profanity and asking again why the officers would shoot. A man with the police department steps in by the commander, telling people they need to back up. The shouting continued amongst the crowd until Navarra walked away from the microphone stand. Lake County Coroner Dr. Howard Cooper on Thursday released the name of the male victim as 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette. A preliminary autopsy conducted Wednesday showed Stinnette died \u201cfrom injuries due to a gunshot.\" Relatives had already identified Stinnette, as well as the\u00a0female who had been shot as Tafara Williams, who was hospitalized in serious condition. She was Stinnette\u2019s girlfriend and the two share a child. In a statement, the Waukegan Police Department explained that the officer \u201cfired his semi-automatic pistol, in fear for his safety.\u201d No firearm was recovered from the fleeing vehicle, and the agency is a body camera and squad car camera department. Authorities did not say if there is video footage from the shooting.

Nerheim reiterated that the process could take several weeks, and there are ethical rules in place preventing some information from being immediately released to ensure a fair and accurate investigation. \u201cI am certainly aware these situations are potentially volatile and elicit many emotions. I strongly urge and hope for continued calm and patience as the investigation takes place,\u201d\u00a0Nerheim said in a statement Wednesday. Nerheim said the Waukegan Police Department will play no role whatsoever in the investigation. Once he has the opportunity to review all the findings, Nerheim said he will then make a determination regarding whether the officers violated any laws. Lake County Coroner Dr. Howard Cooper on Thursday released the name of the male victim as 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette.\u00a0(Facebook/Black Lives Matter Lake County) \u201cShould it be determined the officers violated a law, they will be criminally charged,\u201d he said. \u201cIf laws were not broken, I will write up a detailed statement that will completely review the facts, show the evidence, explain applicable laws, and give our reasoning for the final decision. At that time, the case entire file will be made available to the public on the state's attorney's website at www.lcsao.org.\u201d \u201cFinally, our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of the person that was killed and our prayers for a speedy recovery go out to the person injured in this unfortunate situation,\u201d he added.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visits Kenosha, Wisconsin; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. A piece published in The Washington Post on Thursday was blasted for forecasting \"violence\" beyond the November election if Joe Biden doesn't have a \"landslide\" victory. In the piece titled, \"What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\" Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks, who co-founded the Transition Integrity Project that was established in 2019 to trace potential \"disruptions\" to the transitional period following the 2020 election, explained\u00a0the group \"built a series of war games, sought out some of the most accomplished Republicans, Democrats, civil servants, media experts, pollsters and strategists around, and asked them to imagine what they\u2019d do in a range of election and transition scenarios.\" \"A landslide for Joe Biden resulted in a relatively orderly transfer of power. Every other scenario we looked at involved street-level violence and political crisis,\" Brooks determined. Brooks detailed \"four scenarios\" the project explored: \"a narrow Biden win; a big Biden win, with a decisive lead in both the electoral college and the popular vote; a Trump win with an electoral college lead but a large popular-vote loss, as in 2016; and finally, a period of extended uncertainty as we saw in the 2000 election.\" CNN'S BROOKE BALDWIN PRAISED BIDEN DURING KENOSHA VISIT: HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT FOR 'THE SOUL OF THIS NATION' With the exception of the 'big Biden win'\u00a0scenario, each of our exercises reached the brink of catastrophe, with massive disinformation campaigns, violence in the streets and a constitutional impasse,\" Brooks wrote.\u00a0\"In two scenarios ('Trump win'\u00a0and 'extended uncertainty') there was still no agreement on the winner by Inauguration Day, and no consensus on which candidate should be assumed to have the ability to issue binding commands to the military or receive the nuclear codes. In the 'narrow Biden win'\u00a0scenario, Trump refused to leave office and was ultimately escorted out by the Secret Service \u2014 but only after pardoning himself and his family and burning incriminating documents.\" The project recruited several career political operatives, including Michael Steele and\u00a0Bill Kristol, former Clinton aide John Podesta and former DNC interim chair Donna Brazile (a Fox News contributor) to simulate how their respective parties would react to the various scenarios while other experts in fields like journalism, social media, polling, military, and law were also consulted. \"In each scenario, Team Trump \u2014 the players assigned to simulate the Trump campaign and its elected and appointed allies \u2014 was ruthless and unconstrained right out of the gate, and Team Biden struggled to get out of reaction mode,\" Brooks said. \"In every exercise, both teams sought to mobilize their supporters to take to the streets. Team Biden repeatedly called for peaceful\u00a0protests, while Team Trump encouraged\u00a0provocateurs to incite violence, then used the resulting chaos\u00a0to justify sending federalized Guard units or active-duty military personnel into American cities to 'restore order,'\u00a0leading to still more violence.\" WASHINGTON POST'S JENNIFER RUBIN CLAIMS SHE CRIED '15, 20' TIMES WHILE WATCHING DEM CONVENTION Brooks did, however, specify that the project \"doesn\u2019t predict the future\" but rather lay out what \"could\u00a0go wrong\" in order to prevent such outcomes. Regardless, critics blasted the \"irresponsible\"\u00a0article for suggesting violence is inevitable unless the Democratic candidate has a clear victory. \"WaPo organizes 2020 'war games.'\u00a0They invite Bill Kristol, Michael Steele, John Podesta, Donna Brazile & Jennifer Granholm\u2014ALL OF WHOM support Biden. Their conclusion? Trump is too partisan & EITHER Biden wins big or there will be riots & violence in the streets,\" Sen Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reacted, later impersonating,\u00a0\"'Nice country you got there. It\u2019d be a shame if something happened to it....'\u201d \"GOING TO? You mean CONTINUING TO?\" actress Kirstie Alley tweeted. \"They obvi don\u2019t need an election loss to burn loot shoot murder maim destroy and terrify .. I\u2019d give them an A+ on 'sparking violence' to date. Great team work w the lefty media scouring every corner of earth for specific 'injustices'\u00a0to FUEL.\" \"The scenarios gamed out to do not include a large Trump victory -- presumably because to do so would reveal that violence from the Left would result,\" Ben Shapiro wrote. MSNBC'S JOY REID SAYS 'BLM DOESN'T RIOT,' BLAMES TRUMP FOR ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE FUELED BY 'WHITE NATIONALIST MOBS' \"Problem for all the leftists pushing this clear blackmail threat of 'vote for us or have your country be violently destroyed'\u00a0is that it's an excellent argument *against* voting for them or giving them any power whatsoever,\" The Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued. 'This is irresponsible. An election \"war game\" simulation conducted by a bunch of buddy buddy politicos is not super informative. There's no science behind this. Violent catastrophe is possible, but nothing in this article establishes that it's 'likely,' Reason senior editor Robby Soave dismissed the piece. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Another night of rioting and lawlessness\u00a0exploded in more than half a dozen U.S. cities Saturday night -- with the mayhem including damage to federal buildings, local police precincts, and a fatal shooting in Austin, Texas. Similar protests and violent demonstrations have been seen across the country following the death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota who died while in police custody. A video of the May 25, 2020, encounter with police officers\u00a0showed a White officer putting his knee on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes. Floyd died later that day. Floyd's death -- as well as the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky,\u00a0and other Black men and women -- sparked widespread protests and demonstrations in the U.S. and across the world, which still continue in some cities to this day. Here\u2019s a recap of some of the developments in a sampling of cities. A huge crowd that included the Wall of Moms and the Wall of Vets turned out for yet another day and night of rioting and lawlessness in Portland, Ore., a city that has seen more than 50 consecutive days of such behavior since Floyd's death. Early Sunday local time, rioters broke through a reinforced fence that surrounded the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in the downtown area, OregonLive.com reported. Federal agents assigned to guard the building deployed tear gas and the Portland police declared the scene a riot around 1:15 a.m. local time, the report said. Federal officers advance on demonstrators during a Black Lives Matter protest at the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse Saturday, July 25, 2020, in Portland, Ore. (Associated Press) Saturday night\u2019s demonstration followed what the news outlet said was a familiar pattern: Hours of peaceful protests that eventually devolve into destruction and attacks against police. Social media posts also showed a crowd outside a Marriott hotel that was said to be where federal officers deployed to the city were staying. At one point during Saturday\u2019s daylong protests in Seattle, rioters threw an explosive device that created an eight-inch hole in a wall of the police department\u2019s East District, police Chief Carmen Best said, according to the Seattle Times. SEATTLE POLICE DECLARE RIOT AFTER PROTESTERS SET FIRE TO CONSTRUCTION SITE \u201cWhat we saw today was not peaceful,\u201d Best said. \u201cThe rioters had no regard for the public\u2019s safety, for officers\u2019 safety or for the businesses and property that they destroyed.\u201d \u201cWhat we saw today was not peaceful. The rioters had no regard for the public\u2019s safety, for officers\u2019 safety or for the businesses and property that they destroyed.\u201d Police reported making 45 arrests near the East Precinct as of 10 p.m. local time. They said 21 officers were hit by bricks, rocks and explosives. Most of the injured officers were able to return to work, police said in a Twitter message. Conditions in the area had been declared a riot at 4:30 p.m. after police officers were being assaulted and protesters failed to disperse, Q13 FOX of Seattle reported. Police reported numerous fires and explosions. Best said police planned to use less-lethal crowd management tools, but\u00a0not tear gas, despite a federal judge\u2019s decision late Friday blocking a city council ban on the equipment that was scheduled to take effect Sunday, the Seattle Times reported. A Starbucks store was destroyed and other businesses were covered with graffiti, the outlet reported. A protester wrapped in an American flag spray painted with \"Black Lives Matter\" marches down a street during a protest on Saturday, July 25, 2020, in Oakland, Calif. (Associated Press) A fatal shooting occurred around 9:50 p.m. during a protest in the city, according to reports. Police said a man carrying a weapon approached a vehicle \u2013 but a person inside the vehicle fatally shot the man, the Austin American Statesman reported. Medics arriving at the scene assisted the victim but were unsuccessful, the newspaper reported. Police were in contact with the shooter, who was cooperating with authorities, the report said. One witness said the victim was well known to many protesters, and a group of people was seen grieving at the scene, the newspaper reported. New York Police Department officers walk down a street with shields during a \"Solidarity with Portland,\" protest, Saturday, July 25, 2020, in New York. (Associated Press) A frightening moment happened along Interstate 225 when a vehicle drove through a crowd of marchers in Aurora, Colo., The Guardian reported. At least one person was struck by the vehicle and was taken to a hospital. Elsewhere in the city, demonstrators pushed down a fence, threw objects at police officers, broke windows and started a fire inside the city\u2019s courthouse on Saturday night, Denver\u2019s KCNC-TV reported. The unrest was associated with the death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after an altercation with police nearly a year ago, the station reported.

(Associated Press) It was not immediately clear if police made any arrests,\u00a0according to the news outlet. Hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Oakland, smashing windows of the city\u2019s police headquarters and setting a fire inside the Alameda County courthouse, according to reports. Oakland police confirmed much of the violence via Twitter messages. The crowd had broken through barricades set up outside the courthouse, San Francisco\u2019s KPIX-TV reported. Protesters light fireworks in the middle of downtown Oakland during a protest on Saturday, July 25, 2020, in Oakland, Calif. (Associated Press) Between 75 and 80 protesters were taken into custody after police declared an unlawful assembly, the Omaha World-Herald reported. The crowd started blocking traffic around 9:15 p.m. and police were seeing Facebook posts suggesting that damage was being planned for the downtown area. \u201cIt leaned toward the potential of getting violent,\u201d Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza told the newspaper. The crowd was protesting the May 30 shooting death of James Scurlock, 22, for which Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine declined to file charges, the World-Herald reported \u2013 but Kleine agreed two days later to let a grand jury review the case. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Scurlock was allegedly fatally shot by bar owner Jake Gardner amid a protest in Omaha\u2019s Old Market area, according to the newspaper.

MSNBC host Joy Reid gave a full-throated defense of Black Lives Matter, insisting demonstrators pushing for racial justice don't riot and blaming President Trump for the violence she said is being fueled by \"white nationalist mobs.\" Reid on Saturday shared a local Seattle report from June, suggesting that Black Lives Matter isn't responsible for the unrest because of the 81 arrests that were made at the time and included race in court documents, 32 were White and only eight of them were Black; in addition, more than 70 percent of those\u00a0arrests were from outside the Seattle area. \"Let me repeat this for those inventing the idea of 'Black Lives Matter riots.'\u00a0BLM doesn\u2019t 'riot.'\u00a0They march against police violence. And note that those caught setting fires, assaulting and shooting people are consistently of the RIGHT, not the left,\" Reid tweeted. \"So let\u2019s stop giving in to the narrative Trump and his allies are inventing to try and help him cling to power. Autocrats always eventually get to this place: accusing the opposition of being anarchic and violent to cover up their own rot and violence.\" MSNBC'S JOY REID CLAIMS RNC 'TROTTED OUT' BLACK SPEAKERS TO MAKE WHITES 'FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHITE NATIONALISM' She continued, \"You are MUCH more at risk from unmasked Trump cultists coming home to your suburb from a superspreader rally and coughing or sneezing on you in Walmart or touching the door handle after wiping their nose than you are from a Black Lives Matter rally.\" In a separate series of tweets on Sunday, the \"ReidOut\" host accused the president of wanting to incite violence during his upcoming visit to Kenosha. KAYLEIGH MCENANY CALLS OUT CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO, DON LEMON OVER RIOT COVERAGE \"Let's just be clear: Donald Trump is not going to Kenosha to calm the city or to comfort the family of Jacob Blake, or the families of Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, the two young men shot to death by one of Trump's supporters. He's going to Kenosha to whip up more violence,\" Reid wrote. \"Violence and mayhem, perpetrated by people who support HIM, unleashed at night and let's just be clear: by white nationalist mobs, often against other young white people (both Rosenbaum and Huber were white), in cities with few Black people, IS HIS RE-ELECTION STRATEGY. Period.\" She explained, \"The 'riots'\u00a0are not Black Lives Matter marches gone wrong. Armed white nationalists are mobbing these cities to take advantage of protests and scare fellow white people into quietly siding with them. It's an old, tried and true strategy: using fear & anti-blackness for politics.\" Reid went on to praise her MSNBC colleague Jennifer Rubin, the self-described\u00a0\"conservative blogger\" for The Washington Post who argued that the violence is Trump's and the GOP's fault. \"Listen to \u2066@JRubinBlogger\u2069. She speaks as a longtime conservative Republican, so she KNOWS the party. 'Democrats needn\u2019t accept this narrative that Biden or BLM must bring a stop to the violence Trump is creating. They must denounce HIM for it,'\" the MSNBC host wrote echoing Rubin's op-ed, later writing,\u00a0\"Bottom line: watch the Portland mayor, who is calling Trump out directly for sparking this violence. Trump LITERALLY tweeted: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Biden should remind him of that when he gets to Kenosha. This is Trump violence, in Trump\u2019s America.\" Reid doubled down on her show Monday night, invoking Adolf Hitler and slavery and linking them to Trump fueling\u00a0racial divisions in this country.

No one more than Donald Trump,\" Reid said. \"Trump is losing to Joe Biden full-stop. So to sneak back in through the Electoral College, he needs to win back those American Brexit states that put him over the top in 2016. So his fixation on Kenosha, in Wisconsin, is relevant.\" \"There is no anarchist group on the left that listens to Joe Biden. There is no Antifa for Biden-Harris armed militia, so this is not a 'both sides' thing, but Trump is openly doing the opposite, encouraging more violence,\" she later told her viewers.",

            "article_content": " It is a measure of how frightfully irrational our times are that the \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaign led by Democrats and Black Lives Matter activists is thriving. It has moved to the mainstream of progressive politics even as the need for effective policing becomes ever more palpable. We are not talking\u00a0just\u00a0about\u00a0the rampage that followed the horrific killing of George Floyd, which sent Minneapolis and many other big city hot spots spiraling into rioting and looting. The warning signs have been there for\u00a0a few years, obscure at first but increasingly easy to see. A new breed of progressive prosecutors, many of them backed by the George Soros network and other deep-pocketed leftwing organizations, has taken control in San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia and other urban centers. TUCKER CARLSON: BLACK LIVES MATTER IS NOW A POWERFUL POLITICAL PARTY AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BLACK LIVES Philosophically, they see policing, prosecution and imprisonment as triggers of crime, rather than deterrents against it. They\u2019ve targeted law-enforcement techniques rather than lawbreakers. They adamantly reject the intelligence-based policing and broken windows policies that have given us a generation of record low crime. They\u2019ve eliminated cash bail, which means mandatory release for nonviolent crimes \u2013 with a very elastic definition of \u201cnonviolent.\u201d Once again, we are seeing \u201cThat \u201970s Show,\u201d not the TV program but the phenomenon no one sensible ever wanted to see again: the one where the criminals are back out on the street making mayhem before the police can even finish the paperwork processing the last arrest. Pretty soon, the arrests slow to a trickle, even as the crime increases. Making arrests can be dangerous, and no one wants to take the risk over a pointless gesture. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Such has been domestic tranquility in America since the early 1990s that the decades-long crime wave our nation experienced beginning in 1960s is not in the living memory \u2013 or perhaps even in the historical acquaintance \u2013 of today\u2019s progressive firebrands. They seem to believe that law-and-order is our natural condition rather than our hard-won achievement. They don\u2019t seem familiar with the bad old days, and thus don\u2019t recognize how easily\u00a0those days\u00a0could return. And they are returning. Violent crime is on the\u00a0rise, and\u00a0was edging steadily up even before the mayhem of these last two weeks. Obviously, that trend is becoming a spike. On Sunday, May 31, there were 18 murders just in Chicago \u2013\u00a0according to the\u00a0Sun-Times, the bloodiest day since the University of Chicago\u2019s Crime Lab began keeping data over 60 years ago. The Windy City is a critical part of this discussion because it illustrates a point the \u201cdefund the police\u201d crowd\u00a0conceals, ostracizing whoever dares mention it:\u00a0Eliminating police departments\u00a0would do the most damage to minority communities. To be sure, there are some corrupt police officers, some who engage in excessive uses of force. Congress, along with state and municipal legislatures, needs to explore how we can discipline, fire, sue and otherwise discourage them. Public employee union contracts that protect bad cops \u2013 as well as bad teachers, and other bad \u201cpublic servants\u201d \u2013 need to be scrutinized to the extent they make it very difficult, if not impossible, to take disciplinary action, including termination. For decades, moreover, lawmakers have been AWOL on the issue of \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d That court-made doctrine undermines lawsuits against wayward cops. Of course, police have to have leeway to make good faith errors. Again, law enforcement is dangerous work. Cops\u00a0have to\u00a0make occasional snap judgments, and if they believe they can be sued over bona fide efforts to safeguard the public within the bounds of the law, they will not take the lawful actions we need them to take. While we obsess over the treatment of crime\u2019s perpetrators, it is crime\u2019s victims that merit our most urgent concern.\u00a0Minority communities are the ones most targeted and most wronged\u00a0by criminals. Yet, qualified immunity cannot be so sweeping that it enables patent abuses to escape accountability. Figuring out the appropriate line between tolerable police error and actionable police abuse is the job of lawmakers politically accountable to the people whose lives are at stake. They must not continue abdicating to the courts. All that said,\u00a0though,\u00a0police encounter minority suspects at higher rates because they offend at higher rates.\u00a0The stubborn fact is that this is particularly true of young black males. Though it is fashionable\u00a0to speak of police departments and the criminal justice system as \u201cinstitutionally racist,\u201d\u00a0it is also specious. Over time, police departments more and more reflect the racial and ethnic composition of their communities. In many big cities, top political and law enforcement officials are themselves\u00a0African-American. And as for the justice system writ large, it is overseen by professionals who graduated from elite American law schools.\u00a0With the possible exception of\u00a0college professors, there is no more politically progressive stratum in our society \u2013 and no one prouder to say so than lawyers themselves. The notion that they would abide racism, much less thoroughgoing anti-black racism, in an institution they run would be laughable if the matter were less fraught. We know what offense levels are, not because police are too myopically focused on minority communities, but because crimes have victims.\u00a0Those victims report crime, or are found injured or killed at crime scenes. This is not a statistical game\u00a0fit\u00a0for deducing racism on\u00a0a\u00a0dubious \u201cdisparate impact\u201d theory. This is real life \u2026 and death. While we obsess over the treatment of crime\u2019s perpetrators, it is crime\u2019s victims that merit our most urgent concern.\u00a0Minority communities are the ones most targeted and most wronged\u00a0by criminals. Replacing police forces would not be easy, but wealthier communities have the wherewithal to make alternative security arrangements. They can also avoid working or visiting in high-crime areas. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The people whose families, property and lives would be most under siege if police departments were defunded are minority communities. The places that would collapse are the cities run by the progressives who promote this lunatic fantasy. It would be much better if we\u00a0came to that\u00a0realization\u00a0through common sense than if we allowed history to repeat itself.\u00a0Societal peace and prosperity are dependent on the rule of law, on the order that police uphold. When that is lost, it takes many years to get it back. The damage wrought in the meantime would be incalculable. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY",

LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Lisa Boothe in for Laura Ingraham tonight and this is a special edition of \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from New York. We have a packed show for you tonight. So let's get to it. Tonight is day 58 of violent protests that have shaken the City of Portland. That's right, eight weeks of sustained chaos and the American public has been told by the media and politicians on the Left that somehow it's peaceful. They would tell you that it is nothing but a wall of moms and folks congregating for greater racial justice. But all you have to do is take a look at the scenes night in and night out to realize that that narrative is a complete farce. As a result, the administration sent in 114 officers led by the Department of Homeland Security during the 4th of July weekend. Their goal, to stop the swell of violence and protect monuments and federal buildings that the mayor surrendered to the mob. During the course of their time there these agents have seen flagrant acts of violence and crime, so, of course, they made arrests, which the state attorney general has actually tried to stop. Apparently breaking the law, setting fire to a federal building and attacking officers isn't cause for concern to these liberal leaders. Today, a federal judge smacked down the state's attempt to stop these arrests. And just for doing their jobs it has led to disgusting accusations being hurled at these agents, not just from the Left Wing media, but powerful Leftist politicians. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The use of stormtroopers under the guise of law and order is a tactic that is not appropriate to our country. MAYOR TED WHEELER (D-OR), PORTLAND: Nonviolent Americans are going to be killed for doing nothing other than standing up for American democratic principles. REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): They've been pulling people off the street. This is what you see in countries where you have dictators. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Wow. Well, here to respond to these mayors directly is Ken Cuccinelli, acting DHS Deputy Secretary. Mr. Cuccinelli, before we get some of these crazy things that we're hearing on the Left, there's also been criticism from the Right. You have people that some say, look, these citizens of places like Portland, Oregon, they voted for a radical mayor, they voted for a radical governor, let the city burn, let them deal with the consequences of the policies that they voted for. What do you say to those critics? KEN CUCCINELLI, DHS ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY: You know, I'm this close to agreeing, except we have a federal mission at the Department of Homeland Security, governed by statute. And we've also heard people, this isn't constitutional. And real quick, Lisa, I'd point people to Article I, Section 8 Paragraphs 1, 9 and 18 and the statutes that have been written under it. And one of those statutes charges the Department of Homeland Security with protecting federal properties like this courthouse and Edith Green building there in Portland. So we're not only within the boundaries of the Constitution, we have a statutory charge, and that's the mission we're pursuing there. And when you see such libelous, slanderous comments from people who know better, let's not kid ourselves. The Speaker of the House knows that she's using Nazi allusions to refer to correct professional law enforcement officers. If I was a CBP agent, if I was an ICE agent, if I was an FPS agent, I might just sue her for libel. BOOTHE: Why is she doing that? CUCCINELLI: I mean, that's what that is. BOOTHE: Why is she doing that? CUCCINELLI: Well, one of the sad things right now about the political arena is that the Left views an important part of their base, as people who believe violence is an acceptable way to achieve your goals. And we saw the Mayor Wheeler go out last night. He is way out there. He's radical Left, as you said in your introduction. He's basically turned much of the city over to these violent criminals. And he's tied the hands of his own police department. I feel bad for them - the Portland Police Bureau. And last night he thought he could go out and appease the mob and control them. And he went out and spoke to them. He was booed they called for his resignation. And the right historical analogy has nothing to do with Germany. It has to do with the Bolsheviks. And last night that mayor was a Menshevik, the socialists who went out and thought they could control that revolution, and the bloodthirsty Bolsheviks came in and killed them all. This mob is out for blood. They are not there to protect the First Amendment or to exercise first amendment rights. We all respect those people. At every night that 75 to 100 people and then 1,000 more come later, and start attacking these buildings and the law enforcement officers protecting them. BOOTHE: And sir, the mayor was on the receiving end of things like \"F\" you Ted Wheeler, calls for his resignation, so why does he keep standing up for the mob? CUCCINELLI: You know, his own police last night had to declare a riot. It was quite an interesting display, frankly, and hopefully - or two nights ago. Hopefully, he learned a lesson. I don't know he hasn't learned lessons before, Portland has done this before. And honestly, I think he believes that's where Portland is politically. That's what he needs to do to get reelected in his mind. But how much destruction can Portland take? How much violence are they willing to tolerate? And, honestly, the answer to that goes back to your first question. To a certain extent, that's their business. But now when it impinges on the federal mission, that we are legally charged with protecting and executing. We've got to keep that courthouse working. We've got to keep the federal government functioning there. And that's - our mission is to protect that opportunity for the benefit, frankly, of the residents of Portland and Oregon. So-- BOOTHE: And let's stay on that mission, sir. CUCCINELLI: There's a real big difference. BOOTHE: Well, I want to play you something. CUCCINELLI: Yes, sorry, Lisa. BOOTHE: I'm sure you're not surprised. But the former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has weighed in here. I want you to listen to what he has to say and then I'd love to hear your reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEH JOHNSON, FORMER DHS SECRETARY: The militaristic presence on the streets of the United States and our cities during moments of high tension can actually make matters worse. I used to say to people within DHS, let's not let sideshows, ancillary missions like this derail our core mission and discredit us in the communities where we need to operate. And plainly no one is making that calculation right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Your reaction? CUCCINELLI: Well, look, we all have the right to our opinion, so long as these violent crimes don't overthrow the First Amendment. And Jeh Johnson has a good - lot of experience. But we have a situation here where the President has made it very clear to us that we are not just surrendering the courthouse, we're not just surrendering these properties. And that's really the alternative that former Secretary Johnson didn't address in his comments. His alternative is nothing, because the Portland Police have made it clear, as this Mayor did two years ago, when an ICE facility in Portland was attacked, he publicly withdrew the support of the police and basically declared Open Season. And they're doing it again. So this isn't the first time for Portland, although 58 days in a row violence is pretty extraordinary. If we don't do this mission, no one else will do it. And I don't think people in this country - ordinary Americans are ready to start letting violent criminals and insurrectionists overthrow even a single building of the federal government in a place like Portland. And I will say Portland is totally unique. You look at so many of our other relationships, even in cities where the President and the mayors don't necessarily get along, law enforcement still works together. We still try to pull gangs off the street there. We still work with their police to do that, and they let their police work with us. Only Portland has gone so far and so radical in not just appeasement, but in withdrawing - openly withdrawing even protection from their fellow Americans who are performing their federal mission. BOOTHE: Well, and Governor Inslee actually tweeted out tonight, I believe, that the President is itching for a confrontation, that he wants attention. Is that what it's about? CUCCINELLI: Well, that's pretty ridiculous, really. I mean, the President doesn't need attention. He's the president. He gets plenty doing his day job without these violent interludes that are allowed to happen. And Governor Inslee, like others here in in Oregon, so long as they hold the police back irresponsibly, by which I mean, letting violence run amok, where responsible policing could bring down that level of violence or end it entirely. For instance, in Portland, if they just instituted a midnight to 5:00 am curfew and enforced it, that's when the violence is overwhelmingly happening in that city. BOOTHE: And I-- CUCCINELLI: They would protect their city, their citizens, their businesses. BOOTHE: Deputy Secretary, thank you. We also want to say there's three federal agents that were blinded by lasers. You had rioters trying to board up a federal courthouse and light it on fire with people inside-- CUCCINELLI: And burn it down. Yes. BOOTHE: So we're praying for the safety of federal agents as well with the dangerous situation that's going on there, sir. CUCCINELLI: Thank you. BOOTHE: Thank you for joining us tonight. CUCCINELLI: We appreciate it. BOOTHE: So it isn't just Portland seeing chaos on the streets, teams of tactical border officers are also being sent to Chicago, Albuquerque and Seattle to help fight the rising crime wave. It's gotten so bad that Seattle's Chief of Police is even warning officers not to put themselves at risk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: They had frozen water bottles, some road construction and mortars thrown at them. So we want to make sure, particularly now that we don't have any tools in our tool belt to protect the officers as we did before, that we have some protection around each of the facilities. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Wow. So Joining me now is Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner. Bernie, so the chief there is referring to a law the City Council passed, banning the use of tear gas and pepper spray. This puts officers in a pretty dangerous situation. So my question to you, can police officers even do their jobs right now in the country and particularly cities like Seattle? BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Well, listen, whether it's Seattle, Chicago, Portland or anywhere else, any of these cities run by Democrats these days, it's extremely difficult for them to do their jobs because they don't have the backing, the support, the resources, they need to do the job, the equipment they need to do the job. And I want to touch on one thing, Lisa, when you were talking to Secretary Cuccinelli. Everybody's talking about stormtroopers and the paramilitary and the military - like Jeh Johnson said, we can't have these in our cities. The only thing that's different about those people that's out there making the arrest is their uniform. They're wearing tactical uniforms. They're wearing tactical uniforms, because they can't be out there in dress blues, because they're getting feces and urine thrown at them and Molotov cocktails and all kind of bombardment from these lunatics. They're not going to wear dress blues or whites, they have to be in tactical uniforms and that's the uniforms they're wearing. This isn't about a military operation. BOOTHE: Why do you think that narrative is out there, then? I mean, you just disputed some of the attacks that are going on from the Left and the media, why are we seeing that from them? KERIK: Well, the narrative is out there because these radical Leftist, Marxist politicians, they need to jazz up the lunatics in the field. They want them to - they want to incite them, they want to instigate them. And the only way to do that is basically saying, this is a military attack on our city, this is a military attack on our people. And in therefore, you have to get out and fight. And I will say, I'm going to tell you, as Cuccinelli said, the federal government is charged with protecting the courthouse and the federal buildings. Those politicians, the mayor, the Governor of Portland, Seattle, in these other places, they took an oath - they took a constitutional oath of office to enforce the laws and the Constitution of the of the Federal Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and their state laws. BOOTHE: Well, why aren't they? KERIK: That's exactly right. Why aren't they? BOOTHE: Hello. KERIK: There has to be some way to hold them accountable. Whether it's a civil rights issue, can the FBI come in and look at the civil rights issues? Why aren't they protecting the citizens of Portland? They're obligated by law. BOOTHE: And what's the impact on all of this? We've looked at, as you pointed out, some of the terminology, the way that we're seeing the Left speak about federal police officers, we've seen local police officers also be on the receiving end of just vitriol violence, as well. Look, you're a former NYPD Commissioner, you're talking to police officers on the ground all the time, what's the impact been on them? KERIK: Completely demoralized, whether it's New York City, Seattle, Portland. I talk the New York City cops every day. They're completely demoralized. And the only - the only real comfort they have is the President support. That's it. This Operation Legend - right away Nancy Pelosi who sounds like a kook when she's talking these days. She's basically talking about these stormtroopers. The reality is we have federal agents in New York City, and FBI joint terrorist Task Force, a DEA task force that consist of New York City detectives, State Police, federal agents. When I was a cop, a detective, I was in the DEA Task Force. We already have tons of federal agents in our cities. All the President wants to do is enhance those numbers, go into the communities go after gangs, guns and drugs. That's what has to happen. BOOTHE: Will it be effective? KERIK: That way - yes, it'll be effective, because you're going to charge them federally. No turnstile justice. You're not going to let some state prosecutor let him go. You're going to charge them federally. The U.S. Attorneys are going to prosecute them. They're going to get mandatory minimums, and they're going to go to prison for a long time. BOOTHE: Interesting. Bernie, thank you for joining us. We appreciate it. KERIK: Thank you. BOOTHE: Democrats in the media are working overtime to fear monger over Trump sending in troops to end the wave of violence. This insane talking point that he's turning into a dictator is not only going unchallenged, it's being magnified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Who doesn't think that Donald Trump would try to employ martial law if he thought it was the only way you could stay in power. SEN. RON WYDEN (D-OR): This country may be looking down the barrel of martial law in the middle of an election. WHOOPI GOLDBERG, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST: This feels like a planned attack against the American people. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to be prepared for things that this nation has never faced before. And, unfortunately, that could involve the use of these forces. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: It's almost like some sort of talking point is being circulated out there. Well, here now is Ben Weingarten, Senior Contributor at the Federalist, Columnist at Newsweek and author of American Ingrate. And Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor and host of the \"Sara Carter Show\" podcast. So, Sara, as Democrats are saying, President Trump's not going to accept the results of the 2020 election, have Democrats accepted the results of the 2016 election? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I was just going to say that Lisa, and it's really tragic. The Democrats haven't accepted it since 2016. They're continually trying to remove a duly elected President from office and they're weaponizing now not just law enforcement, but the people in communities that are drastically suffering from not only the COVID shut down with their businesses, but also their children, their education systems, complete social injustice that they feel. These, Democrats, these - I call them Marxist Socialists like to rile up the communities against the government. They don't care about the people that they represent. If they cared about the people they represent. They wouldn't want the people in the streets, rioting, destroying their property, destroying businesses. And unfortunately, we've seen lives lost, so many lives lost. Children as young as one, three years old in Chicago, teenagers, people injured, like you said, law enforcement officials, they're shameful actually and something actually should really be done. I think the President's doing the right thing. I think our federal law enforcement officers are doing the right thing. They are not stormtroopers. And I think we need to move forward as a nation. We need to find a way to unify, but I don't think the Left is going to do that. BOOTHE: And Ben, I want to pull up this article from the \"Wall Street Journal.\" I think it was an opinion column actually from Barton Swaim, and he argues that this is a classic case of projection. He's write - he wrote this. \"I mean, no disrespect to my liberal friends when I say, to borrow Mr. Biden's phrase, that I am absolutely convinced the Democrats won't accept the result if the Republican wins. I say this because with only two exceptions, liberals have considered every GOP presidential victory in the last half century, more or less illegitimate.\" And that was the exception, I think, since 1968, with the exception of two which were 49 State, landslide. So I think maybe the Left are the ones that aren't accepting the results here. What say you? BEN WEINGARTEN, NEWSWEEK COLUMNIST: I think - well, look - well, first of all, Hillary Clinton herself has clearly not accepted the results of the 2016 election and the election before the night was over was called illegitimate and the President was challenged on it. But look, it says everything you need to know about the modern Democratic Party, that restoring the rule of law on our streets is considered a totalitarian act, but anarchy and mob rule and rioting is considered legitimate activity. Also to your point, which is a great one. The fact of the matter is that it is the Left that has been engaging in totalitarian acts since before the President was elected. We haven't even gotten yet to the depths of the weaponization and politicization of the national security and intelligence apparatus, precisely because the Left and the media, but I repeat myself, the resistance have done everything they possibly could to halt the peaceful transition of power, which is the hallmark of our representative democracy, which they love to talk about so much, but they don't actually want to let it function. So I think what this really comes down to is, once again, the Left is trying to de legitimize the president again, even before he is potentially reelected and make it seem as if it's not a real victory and this isn't a real serious President. And then the other thing is, I think it's very clear, they think very little of the American people that they think we're stupid. They think that we can't see through the lies and the smears and innuendo and propaganda. BOOTHE: And about-- WEINGARTEN: This President has been checked more than any president in our lifetime. BOOTHE: Well, and about that, Sara, so first of all, this seems very similar to the Russia hysteria that we've all gone through - where we went through for years. But also you have Democrats that say that President Trump is undermining - he's undermining norms and institutions. But they were the ones who called for the abolishing of the Electoral College. They are the ones who call for faithless electors. And they are the ones that use the DOJ and the FBI to spy on a political opponent. CARTER: Right. And they were the ones that call for defunding police and they're the ones that instigating all of this anger inside the communities that they should be caring for and nurturing. Look, the bigger problems we've seen have been in communities actually run by Democratic politicians. Chicago, we see it in Portland, Oregon, we see it in Seattle. We've seen it in New York City. We've even seen it here in Washington, DC, and the only people that are paying the price for this are the American people. And you brought up a really great point there, Lisa, because when you talk about weaponization I thought about this tonight. I thought not only did they weaponize our law enforcement, our intelligence agencies, but they're trying to weaponize the people against each other. BOOTHE: Right. CARTER: The President of the United States is not going to call martial law or he's not sending stormtroopers. He's trying to protect the citizens of this country. Maybe the Democrats should try doing that a little bit, so we don't see more bloodshed and we don't lose more children. And maybe they should resolve the problems in their own home. BOOTHE: And Ben real quick, 15 seconds before we got to go, close this out. WEINGARTEN: The President is the one standing up for the Constitution. The Democrats are the ones trying to shred it. He can't even overturn an awful Obama administration Executive Order and he's being called a tyrant. It's laughable. BOOTHE: All right, Benefit, Sara, thank you. Coming up, we are way past tearing down Confederate statues. We'll show you what happened in Chicago last night with Horace Cooper and Steve Cortez. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: After violent clashes with police, Chicago's Christopher Columbus statues had been removed. When the crowds protesting outside of Mayor Lightfoot's home learned that the one in Grant Park would be taken down in the dead of the night, they cheered. Then reportedly demanded police to be defunded. Joining me now to discuss all of this is Horace Cooper, Co-Chair of Project 21 and author of \"Trump is Making Black America Great Again\". Also with me is Steve Cortes, Salem Radio Host. Steve so it's Christopher Columbus, it's Abraham Lincoln. It's an Elk in Portland, Oregon that got lit on fire. I am starting to get the sense that this isn't about the Confederacy or racism. STEVE CORTES, SALEM RADIO HOST: No, it sure isn't. All you know, unfortunately here in Chicago, we saw a dangerous dereliction of duty. This was really an abdication by Mayor Lightfoot as she is unfortunately presiding over a city - my city which is devolving into chaos. Last weekend, we had 70 people shot in the city of Chicago, and the weekend began, as you mentioned last Friday, one week ago, with a pitched battle at that statue between a lot of brave police officers facing off with a bunch of Marxist malcontents who wanted to inflict their will and tear that statue down. Now the cops held their ground, they paid a heavy price for it. 18 of them went to the emergency room, but they won that battle, thankfully, and not just preserving this and protecting the statue, but more importantly, protecting the principle of the rule of law and public order. And what did Mayor Lightfoot do then? She completely betrayed those cops, and she gave in and caved to the mob. This was a complete capitulation and unfortunately sends a message to those kinds of mobs that they can win and that they can get political power, not through persuasion, but through force and intimidation. It's a very dangerous precedent. BOOTHE: So Horace, we saw on Wednesday night, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler trying to go out to the mob and talk to them. He was met with things thrown at him, \"F\" you, resign. The Mayor of Minneapolis faced a similar scenario when he tried to go out and talk to the mob. So why does the Left keep trying to appease the mob when they clearly cannot be appeased? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21: The Left is the mob, that's exactly the problem. You see, this is not about the tragic death of George Floyd. This is about the cancel culture having an opportunity and taking the advantage. Black Americans have not said universally that their big problem that they face every day is that they see an occasional Confederate statue, or that there's a military base named after a former Confederate General or leader. What really matters in America, Black, White, or Brown are the kinds of things that the cancel culture could care less about. Here's the truth, after statues are taken down in the dark of night without using the legislative process, without persuasion, and discussion, people who are looking for jobs are still going to be looking for jobs. People who have struggles with poor education in their community are still going to have those. The Amazing - amazing thing about how the cancel culture is getting away with pushing its radical agenda, and in light of all of the scrutiny that America is saying that it wants to pay attention to that these issues have moved front and center. This is just a good example of them never letting an opportunity to do the radical thing go by. STEVE CORTES, SALEM RADIO HOST: Horace -- BOOTHE: Well, and we also saw -- hold on just one second. There's one other topic I'd like to discuss with you guys. So we all saw the former vice president, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, he called President Trump racist. On top of that, this is what Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush claims Trump is really doing by deploying federal agents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOBBY RUSH (D-IL): Trump wants to instigate a race war. He wants to have black folks fighting white folks so he can rise up and say I'm the real the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and I'm the president. Reelect me. That's what he's trying to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Steve? CORTES: Look, a deranged rant, unfortunately, from Bobby Rush. I'm not surprise there. But Joe Biden should know better. He doesn't, unfortunately. This is, unfortunately, the default position of the left when they no longer want to talk policy. They just call us racist. The people of America, though, and Horace was exactly right, the people of America want jobs, not mobs. And you mentioned previously, Lisa, about the inability to mollify, the inability to satisfy the mob by giving them what they allegedly want. They will always come back for more. And I would also say this. I think there is something way more sinister than just trying to take down statues. That's bad enough. The statues, I believe, are a dress rehearsal, because these Marxists will not be sated with trophies merely of granite and stone. They are going to come for real people, for living, breathing human beings, people like me who dare to disagree with them. That is where at the left is trying to take this country. And we have to meet it with force and resolve. Unfortunately, Mayor Lightfoot showed exactly the opposite. BOOTHE: Horace? COOPER: I just want to understand, was Bull Connor trying to achieve a race war? What about Governor Orville Faubus? When the president of the United States, Dwight Eisenhower was forced to send in a federal force to ensure that the rights of Americans were protected, is this what I'm hearing Bobby Rush say? Is this what I'm hearing the modern progressives say? What is amazing to me is that the racial segregationists of the 18th century, the 19th century, the 20th century, and even now the 21st century, all, like FDR said, that all we have to fear is fear itself. Today's modern liberal movement, all they have to offer is race itself. BOOTHE: Also the congressman might want to take a look at some of the things that the former vice president has said, like former President Obama was the first mainstream African-American who was bright, clean, and articulate, saying poor kids could be just as bright as white kids, or you have to have a slight Indian accent to go into a Dunkin Donuts or a 7- Eleven. So maybe he should take a look at those comments as well. Steve, Horace, thank you. CORTES: Thank you. BOOTHE: Thank you. Up next, the worst media offenders of the week, \"The Ingraham Angle\" has got its eyes on you. The tape you don't want to miss is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: I left that intro. So it's really easy to become numb about the media bias these days. So \"The Ingraham Angle\" is keeping track of the worst offenders of the week. Joining me now is Rachel Campos-Duffey, FOX News contributor, and Jeffrey Lord, former CNN contributor and author of \"Swamp Wars.\" Panel, let's begin with CNN's Don Lemon, who after shaming President Trump had a bit of trouble with his own cognitive abilities test. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: What were the animal shapes? DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Well, it's a lion, a hippo, and a camel. CUOMO: Isn't that a rhino in the middle? LEMON: A rhino. CUOMO: You don't even know a hippo from a rhino. You've got no acuity, son. You've got no acuity. LEMON: I'm looking at it backwards. I'm looking at it backwards. CUOMO: What does it mean if you don't know an elephant from a rhino? (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Apparently, it's really hard. The embarrassment for CNN didn't end there. Here is what happened when Erin Burnett tried to go to the doctor who created the cognitive test. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: There is one, a question that asked if a patient can recognize the drawing of a lion, they have doing this to sort of suggested that it is a very easy test. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Certainly, questions are harder than others, especially the five word recall, and most patients do not get the five words. Most of them get 3.7 words. So it's not that easy. BURNETT: Is that fair, the last five questions are hard and a fully normal person who didn't have memory issues would have trouble? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is challenging. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Rachel, Burnett seemed really disappointed to. RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, she did. First of all, let me say, I can't even remember my kids' names, so I was really impressed with how the president did on this. And this really shows bias. The story here isn't about the president who actually aced the test. The story is about Joe Biden who claimed that he has repeatedly taken this test and yet he refuses to release the results. It's about the candidate who is showing cognitive decline, the candidate who busts into very bizarre rants about children combing his leg hair and nurses blowing up his nose. That's the story. Why hasn't Joe Biden taken this test and released the results? BOOTHE: And Jeffrey, about that, Democrats have made that an issue themselves. Joe Biden has brought up his age on the campaign trail. There was a \"Politico\" article talking about how they were debating if he should just say he's going to be a one-term president. They are the ones that made this an issue, right? CAMPOS-DUFFY: Sure. JEFFREY LORD, FORMER CNN CONTRIBUTOR: They have. This is one of the problems they're going to have when Joe Biden gets out there. Just the other day he referred to Arizona as a city. I can't wait for him to be doing his debates with President Trump, who really does have a pretty good memory and is really good at this kind of thing. And I just have to say, I have to laugh that Don Lemon, my old CNN colleague, didn't know that a RINO is, and I have could have told him had I been there, that that stands for \"Republican in name only.\" (LAUGHTER) BOOTHE: Panel, this week the Trump administration busted a massive illegal spying ring at the Chinese consulate in Houston, they rightfully ordered it close, but this is how MSNBC Andrea Mitchell tried to spin it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC HOST: Do you suspect there is a political motive? We're sorry to say, but in this context where the president keeps talking about the China virus, albeit China did mishandle their original reporting on the COVID-19. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They certainly did. They certainly did. MITCHELL: But do you think this is partly to find a scapegoat? (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Jeff, why is she making it political? LORD: Yes, well, this is what you do when you start with anti-Trump bias. And I want to say this on behalf of the president. The president when he was a private citizen, long before he was elected president, spoke to me when I was talking to him at length about China. He has been very much the hardliner, said that his predecessors weren't doing the job. The idea that this is suddenly some political move on his part is absurd. He is not going to be taken advantage of here, and he feels certainly in the current circumstances that's what has happened, and he is not going to put up with it. BOOTHE: Rachel, I want you to weigh in on this one. So MSNBC's Joy Reid found her favorite word of the day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: He's using that trumped up charge to justify what in any other country, particularly an authoritarian one, would be called the secret police. He needs to have his secret police. There is the secret police aspect of it. These federal secret police. The deploying of secret police. It's a secret police vibe. Using his own secret police. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: So we kept count, and \"secret police\" was said a total of seven times that night, Rachel. CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right, and it's so rich because the real secret police story is the scandal, the Obama scandal that they refused to cover, which is President Obama spying on the Donald Trump campaign. That is really third world, banana republic, secret police stuff. Here is the deal, they are calling on these federal agents stormtroopers. They're calling them -- they're comparing them to Pinochet and Putin. It's outrageous. These are federal agents who are defending federal buildings against anarchists and Antifa. That's what they're supposed to do. BOOTHE: Jeff? LORD: Yes, Article Two, Section Three of the Constitution says the president quite specifically shall take care to see that the laws are faithfully executed. The president is upholding his constitutional duty. And to say in doing so he is violating the Constitution is nonsense, upside down. BOOTHE: Rachel, Jeff, thanks so much for joining us. CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, thank you. BOOTHE: Coming up, you've seen the Black Lives Matter murals -- I can't say, it's a hard word to say -- painted on streets across the country. So what happened when one Trump supporter tried to get a MAGA mural? Laura spoke with her, and it's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: In cities big and small across America, activists have the full support of local officials to paint Black Lives Matter murals on prominent city blocks. When the issue came to Redwood City, California, on July 4th, it was quickly proved. And in this case local resident Dan Pease not only got permission, the city supplied him with all of the paint and so forth, to do it. That's when Redwood citizen and real estate attorney Maria Rutenburg stepped in. She didn't have an issue with the BLM message being displayed at all, but she just argued if city streets were now a public forum, she should be able to display her own mural, MAGA 2020. Instead of allowing both to exist simultaneously, the city took down the BLM signage as a way to keep anything pro-Trump off of their streets. Maria Rutenburg joins us now. Maria, thank you for being here. Now, I understand that you even offered to pay the cost of the painting, but the city still shut it down? Now, why do you think that is? MARIA RUTENBURG: That's right. Well, I guess they didn't want to see MAGA 2020 painted on a main street in the city. BOOTHE: Well, they actually issued a statement, Maria, where they basically said this was only going to be a temporary Black Lives Matter mural, and they never intended it to be, I'll read it. \"The Black Lives Matter was intended for a short duration. Staff's concern about public safety issues that may arise from painting murals on public streets which could result in driver confusion and traffic accidents. Thus, the existing mural has been removed.\" But you maintain it is because you were going to call them on this, and if it's a public forum, let it rip. RUTENBURG: That's exactly right. And I believe that the city has obligations not to discriminate on the basis of content of political speech. We are all equal when it comes to the First Amendment, and if somebody has the right to speak, which is BLM, and I have no problem with them expressing themselves on asphalt. This is completely their right even if I don't agree with the message. So should they allow me to speak. And I have one message, I'm sure somebody else has something else. And the moment you open up asphalt as a public forum, you are stuck with so many different opinions you're not going to know what to do with them. INGRAHAM: Maria, I can tell because I lived in the former Soviet Union that that's a Russian accent that you have. RUTENBURG: Yes. INGRAHAM: So explain why -- does that play into at all your appreciation of the freedom you have in this country to speak out without fear of being intimidated, both whether it's on the right or the left? RUTENBURG: Exactly. And I became a lawyer because I admire the Constitution. I think we need the document in this country, and it is our duty to defend it. And in these trying times, if anything is uniting us it's Constitution. And cities, instead of looking for ways to divide us and create a political firestorm, they should look for something that gets us all together. And if they want to have us do a political discussion, that's totally fine. But they should honor every single side that has something to say. As an American I think it's my obligation to honor and respect other people's opinion, but I want them to respect mine as well. And if I have something to say, they should let me do it. And my biggest problem was with the city, because when cities become arbiters of private expression, that is basically the end of the United States. They should not be picking and choosing the messages they like to hear and not to hear. If they open up something for discussion, it's open season for everybody, and we can all say what we want. That's a basic American principle. INGRAHAM: That is fair, and that's a truly liberal perspective. Earlier in the month, by the way, the Redwood City public library had an artwork display featuring pieces from the city's BLM protest. Now, something tells me they wouldn't put up an art display for a pro-life protest, in other words. RUTENBURG: Don't worry about that, yes. INGRAHAM: Never going to happen. RUTENBURG: For sure, for sure. But it's their right, they can display things. But that's their right to censorship things. So we're all equal. We all live in the city. There's a lot of people expressing different things, and their obligation is to bring us together, not to divide us. INGRAHAM: Maria, thank you for joining us, and it was a clever thing you did. And who knows, it might catch on across the United States? RUTENBURG: Thank you so much for having me. INGRAHAM: More speech, not less. Thanks so much. RUTENBURG: Exactly. Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) BOOTHE: Amen to that, more speech, not less. Coming up, Governor Cuomo has a new COVID rule for now New Yorkers, but he better watch out. The folks in Buffalo might not be too thrilled. The Last Bite is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: Michael Bloomberg had his war on soda, now Governor Cuomo has his war on appetizers in New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): To be a bar, you had to have food available, soups, sandwiches, et cetera. More than just hors d'oeuvres, chicken wings, you had to have some substantive of food. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: So I am directly offended by this, because wings, that is a meal, and it is substantive food. But yes, so in 90 degrees, it's going to 90 degrees in New York this weekend, so perfect weather for sitting at an outdoor bar with a cold beer and a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup, right. That's all the time we have tonight. Thank you for watching this special edition of \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I'm Lisa Boothe in for Laura Ingraham.

One Boston woman has become a social media sensation following an\u00a0interview ahead of the 2020 presidential election, during which she was hamming it up for a local news station in a wicked-funny moment sure to amuse any Massachusettsan. Hundreds voted at Fenway Park on Saturday, as the nation\u2019s oldest ballpark doubled as the\u00a0polling place of choice for\u00a0Laura Eastaugh, who\u00a0was thrilled to cast her ballot, The Boston Globe reports. 'PUMPKIN TASTY': DUNKIN' DONUTS SIGN GOES VIRAL AFTER 18-YEAR-OLD IS TASKED WITH PUTTING UP 'WHATEVER' In a quick interview with WHDH that has since gone viral, the Brighton woman waxed poetic about democracy \u2014 and Dunkin\u2019. \u201cI wanted to vote at Fenway because we've all been cooped up inside for a little bit, and I've got my Dunkies,\u201d Eastaugh said, waving her arms and brandishing her iced coffee from the chain. \"I\u2019m ready to vote for Joe Biden, but I wish I was voting for Bernie Sanders, but it\u2019s a team sport.\u201d Apparently ready for her close-up, Eastaugh sported a Cam Newton Patriots jersey, as well as a face mask featuring the intertwined logos of the Patriots, Red Sox, Bruins and Celtics.

Black Lives Matter members in Chicago held a rally on Monday to support the more than 100 arrested last night following\u00a0widespread looting and rioting that caused at least $60 million in property damage\u00a0and saw 13 police officers injured, according to a report. The rally was organized by Black Lives Matter Chicago and was held at a police station in the South Loop where organizers say individuals are currently being held in custody. At least one organizer called the looting tantamount to\u00a0\"reparations.\" \u201cI don\u2019t care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy\u2019s or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,\u201d said Ariel Atkins, a BLM organizer, according to NBC Chicago. \u201cThat makes sure that person has clothes.\u201d CHICAGO MAYOR LIGHTFOOT PUSHES BACK AGAINST QUESTION ABOUT RIOTERS BEING ENCOURAGED BY 'LACK OF CONSEQUENCES' Protesters hold a banner as Ariel Atkins (not seen), a lead organizer for Black Lives Matter Chicago, talks to reporters Monday, Aug. 10, 2020, outside the Chicago Police Department's District 1 station in Chicago.

            "article_content": "Sen. Chuck Schumer, NYC Mayor de Blasio tweet congratulations to the president-elect; Alex Hogan reports. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has resulted in over 230,000 deaths in the United States and rightfully dominated much of the news cycle for several months with CNN often using it to bash conservatives and Trump supporters alike \u2013 but critics think the so-called\u00a0\u201c#FactsFirst\u201d network takes a different approach when liberals gather in large groups. \u201cIf CNN wanted to have more widespread trust and be listened on things like the coronavirus, they should apply their same condescending takes and snarky chyrons about death and selfishness to the people who went out yesterday,\u201d NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News. ACTRESS KIRSTIE ALLEY SAYS CNN IS 'BROADCASTING TERROR' WITH NONSTOP CORONAVIRUS FEARMONGERING CNN was long accused of \u201cterrifying people\u201d with round-the-clock coverage of the pandemic, complete with snarky chyrons blaming the virus on President Trump, anchors shaming anyone caught without a mask and pundits masquerading as scientists and doctors offering hot takes on COVID-19. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper is not as harsh when discussing pro-Biden events amid the coronavirus pandemic as he is when condemning Trump rallies. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for WarnerMedia) (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for WarnerMedia) But CNN\u2019s concerns about the coronavirus pandemic appeared to have been somewhat mitigated by Democratic nominee Joe Biden being projected as the winner of the 2020 presidential election. On Saturday morning liberals flocked to the streets in celebration that the race was called for Biden and the network that frequently labeled Trump rallies and White House ceremonies as \u201csuper spreader\u201d events was suddenly less concerned with massive events amid the pandemic. CNN left-wing anchor Jake Tapper appeared reluctant to come off as a nuisance to Biden supporters who were celebrating in the streets on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing people wearing masks\u2026 mostly wearing masks, they\u2019re not socially distancing. I hate to be a scold here but we just had the highest day of infections in the United States,\u201d Tapper told viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see people wearing masks, for some of them, they\u2019re slipping off their face, people also need to socially distance themselves, the masks are significant, though, they are the thing that doctor\u2019s say are most important.\u201d PRO-TRUMP ACTRESS KIRSTIE ALLEY SLAMS CNN'S COVID COVERAGE: \u2018FEAR OF DYING IS THEIR MANTRA\u2019 Dana Bash chimed in, \"But I can see Sanjay Gupta having a lot of heartburn right now,\" referring to the network's chief medical correspondent and\u00a0Tapper agreed that a lot of public health officials probably have \u201cagita\u201d watching the celebrations. \u201cBut, again, at least they are wearing masks,\u201d Tapper reiterated. Tapper even specifically praised the voters in his hometown of Philadelphia. \"Philadelphians, realizing the significant role they played in this election, taking to the streets in celebration in the birthplace of liberty, we should say, in this country,\" Tapper told Bash.\u00a0\"I'm sorry for interrupting. I had to say hi to my friends.\" \u201cAfter their throwaway couple moments admitting that these celebrations were in direct contradiction to guidelines, CNN quickly went back to marveling at the sights of so many partying in the streets,\u201d\u00a0Houck observed. DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall feels the\u00a0coronavirus story has had political implications from the get-go. \u201cThat didn't necessarily serve the interests of the citizenry, but it did serve the interests of shrill media voices and anti-Trump political opponents.\u00a0Failing to criticize the weekend political celebration crowds after condemning Trump campaign crowds as dangerous just shows the inconsistency of the political activists,\u201d McCall told Fox News. CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO FACES CORONAVIRUS HYPOCRISY CHARGES ONCE AGAIN \u201cWhen Tapper expressed concern about being a \u2018scold,\u2019 he essentially acknowledged the varying standards on coronavirus dangers exhibited in the mainstream media,\u201d McCall said. \"When Tapper expressed concern about being a \u2018scold,\u2019 he essentially acknowledged the varying standards on coronavirus dangers exhibited in the mainstream media.\" Tapper and the network both appeared outraged by a Fox News report indicating that CNN held Biden and Trump supporters to a different standard, defending themselves on Twitter with video of the anchor\u2019s \u201cscold\u201d line to back up claims they did sound the alarm about Biden supporters partying in the streets. Tapper\u2019s concern of coming across as a \u201cscold\u201d was drastically different than his approach last month when he condemned President Trump for holding rallies. The \u201cState of the Union\u201d anchor closed his Oct. 11 show with a diatribe against the president for holding rallies amid the pandemic that Tapper labeled \u201csuper-spreader\u201d events. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] need to hold these rallies apparently exceeding his concern for those attending them,\u201d Tapper told viewers last month.\u00a0\u201cOne of President Trump\u2019s skills during this era has been to behave with so little regard to basic decency, those who try to uphold the standards get accused of being partisan. As if \u2018don\u2019t behave in a way that\u2019s reckless and displays a wanton disregard for human life\u2019 is somehow now a partisan issue. It isn\u2019t.\u201d Tapper then scolded Trump for \u201creckless behavior\u201d regarding the coronavirus and accused him of indulging his ego at the risk of prolonging the pandemic. CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO CAUGHT 'HOBNOBBING WITHOUT A MASK' AFTER PUSHING MASKS ON AIR: REPORT \u201cTrump has likely become, personally, a vector of the disease... the president is taking part in actions that could result in loss of life\" \u201cTrump has likely become, personally, a vector of the disease,\u201d Tapper continued during his October rant. \u201cHe is increasing the likelihood that other Americans will contract it through holding these reckless rallies\u2026. The president is taking part in actions that could result in loss of life.\u201d Political satirist Tim Young spent much of the pandemic traveling around America and speaking to voters about their concerns for a Washington Times project. Along the way he noticed that \u201ca lot of people view CNN as a laughing stock and the PR wing of the Democratic Party.\" \"CNN has made clear time and time again that you can\u2019t catch COVID from anything that leans left,\u201d Young told Fox News. \"CNN has made clear time and time again that you can\u2019t catch COVID from anything that leans left.\" FLASHBACK: CHRIS CUOMO SLAMS PENCE FOR NOT WEARING MASK AT CLINIC Young pointed out that CNN called Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation at the White House a \"super-spreader event,\u201d but doesn\u2019t hold liberals to the same standard. \u201cYou can only catch COVID from Trump rallies, church, and small family gatherings like Thanksgiving and Christmas. When you attend a Black Lives Matter riot or a massive celebration for Joe Biden, CNN is clear that your immune to any and all airborne viruses,\u201d Young continued. \u201cMeanwhile when thousands of liberals slobber all over each other in the streets of D.C. and New York for Biden's yet-to-be-certified win, they don\u2019t passionately condemn it. If that's not a double standard and bias, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d Roughly 24 hours after Biden was declared the winner, the thin-skinned Tapper changed his tune after being called out for hypocrisy over the way he downplayed pro-Biden celebrations compared to his harsh words about Trump events. As CNN panicked to maintain credibility after being exposed by Fox News, Tapper on Sunday morning asked Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders about the situation while reiterating that the partyers mostly wore masks. TUCKER CARLSON: THE CURIOUS CASE OF CHRIS CUOMO, MASK HYPOCRITE \u201cWe saw a lot of celebrations of President-elect Biden\u2019s victory in the streets of so many major American cities\u2026 I know, at least based on what we saw on screen, a lot of these people were wearing masks but not all of them were,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cThe CDC guidelines say, \u2018Even if you\u2019re wearing a mask, you should avoid crowds,\u2019 new coronavirus cases are souring\u2026\u00a0Is it incumbent upon President-Elect Biden to make it clear to his supporters that crowds are a bad idea during this pandemic, even if people are wearing masks, and he understands that they want to celebrate but they shouldn\u2019t be filling the streets like that?\u201d Sanders declared that Biden would eventually speak out on the issue, noted that Biden\u2019s Saturday night speech featured attendees staying in their cars and urged people to be safe and wear a mask. Tapper then wrapped up the interview without a follow-up question, as pro-Biden celebrations were never condoned as \u201csuper spreader\u201d events or \u201creckless.\u201d CNN didn\u2019t scold people celebrating Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s projected win like it condemned Trump rally goers, according to critics. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Meanwhile, Tapper was hardly alone when it came to criticizing Trump, his supporters and other non-liberals for\u00a0holding rallies amid the pandemic: Former New York Times reporter and author Alex Berenson, who has been an outspoken critic of COVID lockdowns, feels the hypocrisy is \u2018obvious\u201d and shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone at this point. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cIt's absurd for the same people complaining that Trump was putting his supporters at grave risk to be lionizing Biden's fans. Especially when in the next breath they try to scare everyone with news that cases (positive tests) have hit a new high. We have seen lots and lots of rules-are-for-thee-not-for-me this year, and this is one more example,\u201d Berenson told Fox News. CNN even investigated\u00a017 Trump campaign rallies to determine if host counties saw a coronavirus spike following the event. It remains to be seen if the liberal network conducts thorough probes of the aftermath of Biden victory celebrations. Fox News' Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report.

The sixth annual Law Enforcement Appreciation Day event was scheduled to be held Sunday from 3 to 6 p.m. at the amphitheater in Civic Center Park in Denver. It was advertised\u00a0by the Pro Police Rally Colorado Facebook page. Randy Corporon, an attorney who helped organize the \"family-friendly\" event involving food and live music by Becker Band, said Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen had asked him to either reschedule or move the pro-police gathering from its normal location, citing a risk that officers could be put in danger as Black Lives Matter demonstrators planned a counter-protest also at the Civic Center Park. NAVY VETERAN PRAISED AS 'CAPTAIN PORTLAND' AFTER BEATING BY FEDERAL OFFICERS DURING RIOTS A man bleeds from his head after being injured at a pro-law enforcement rally that clashed with counter-protesters demonstrating against racial inequality, in Denver, Colorado, U.S. July 19, 2020. (Reuters/Kevin Mohatt) \u201cHe was agitated that we're going to get his officers hurt,\u201d Corporon told the Denver Post.\u201cMy response to him was that he should allow his officers to do their job and if people are down there breaking the law, to stop them. Because they'll have nothing to fear from us.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re exercising our constitutional right to peacefully assemble, and we have no intention of giving up that ground to these domestic terrorists,\u201d he said before the event. \u201cThis chief of police is the guy who walked hand-in-hand with Black Lives Matter.\u201d \u201cIf you agree that the domestic terrorists don't own the streets and our parks in my birthplace, once beautiful Denver Colorado, please join me,\u201d Corporon\u00a0tweeted Saturday advertising the event the next day. Shortly after the band began to play around 3 p.m. on Sunday, anti-police demonstrators, who greatly outnumbered the group who had shown up to show their support for law enforcement, moved into the amphitheater space and banged drums, blew whistles, clanged pots, clapped and shouted obscenities to drown out the music, according to the Denver Post. Several people threw punches. Photos showed clashes between women from opposing sides pulling each other\u2019s hair. One man was bloodied and had a large gash in his forehead.

(Reuters/Kevin Mohatt) Officers on duty to monitor the event tried to form a line between the two groups but could not completely separate the opposing sides. Denver Police later confirmed they used chemical sprays in at least three separate instances to help disperse the crowd. PORTLAND 'WALL OF MOMS' ACTING AS HUMAN BARRIER BETWEEN PROTESTERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin posted several videos documenting the events Sunday as they unfolded. She said Black Lives Matter protesters swarmed the stage and attacked several women attending the pro-police rally, some using collapsable batons. Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli reacted to the \u201cOutrageous violence\u201d seen in Denver Sunday, tweeting \u201cThese tyrannical, left-wing anarchists hate free speech. If you do not agree with them, they believe you must be beaten down \u2013 literally.\u201d Most of the people showing support for law enforcement had left within an hour. Anti-police demonstrators also stood in front of a police vehicle to prevent it from leaving, the Post reported. One person was arrested for assault. Police said a supervisor was at the scene to ensure the two pepper ball deployments and one hand-held fog device deployment were carried out according to the department's policy.

Those tools are used only if there is some sort of disruption or threat to safety,\u201d Denver police spokesman Tyrone Campbell told the Post. The counter-protest was organized by Party for Socialism and Liberation, and other Black Lives Matter supporters, including the Afro-Liberation Front, according to KMGH-TV. Lillian House, an organizer for the Party of Socialism and Liberation, said any celebration in support of police is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cjust all around out of touch with the struggles people are facing.\u201d \"There's not much else to say other than every cop here is a terrorist by association,\" Hale Rardin, a Black Lives Matter supporter at the scene, told the station. In response to the criticism against\u00a0law enforcement, Pro Police Rally Colorado founder Ron MacLachlan said his group is not against police reform or Black Lives Matter advocating for racial justice but made a distinction that \u201cWe've got to stand with our men and women in law enforcement. Without them, we are in chaos and anarchy.\" \u201cThe idea that these people have been around for the last six weeks going out and terrorizing different neighborhoods for a couple hours at a time, that's not acceptable,\" he said, referring to the civil unrest that's unfolded since George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis in May. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Before the event Sunday, MacLachlan said the pro-police gathering was not just for officers but also for their families. He pondered, \u201cWhat kind of home are they in when they have that kind of tension going on inside their lives?\" Malkin also claimed MacLachlan \u201cwas beaten with just minutes after praying\" by Black Lives Matter protesters using a bullhorn and a longhorn. She also said police Chief Pazen, \u201cwho marched with BLM last month, let pro-police patriots get beaten and silenced.\u201d",

A pro-Black Lives Matter cartoon made available to students at a Florida school district\u00a0outraged some parents, who claimed the district was trying to indoctrinate students with a left-wing agenda. The controversial\u00a0\u201cBlack Lives Matter Protests\u201d cartoon has since been pulled by the Sarasota County district.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\" September 11, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Massive wildfires, unprecedented in their scope continue to sweep across huge portions of the West tonight. In Oregon, half a million residents have been forced to evacuate their homes. That's one of every 10 people in the entire state. Dozens are dead, including small children. But the fires still are not close to contained. Watch this report from Fox's Jeff Paul. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Months of tinder dry conditions added to days of high winds and hot temperatures creating a perfect firestorm across the West. California is one of the hardest hit with a record breaking three million acres burned and nearly 4,000 homes and buildings lost so far. A 12-year-old boy and his grandmother are among the latest deaths. The flames are spreading so fast, it really doesn't give people much time to get out. The fires also taking a toll in Washington State where more than a hundred homes are gone, and a one-year-old boy died as his family tried to flee the flames. And in Oregon, more than 35 fires are burning with at least five small towns destroyed. Resources across the west are stretched thin. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: It is awful and it continues as we speak right now. Walls of flame consuming everything in their path, homes, thousands and thousands, untold numbers of animals, and of course, as we said human beings, too. It is tragedy on a massive scale. When something this terrible happens, decent people pause. They put their own interests aside for a moment. They consider how they can help. We've seen that kind of selflessness before in this country. This is, remember, the anniversary of 9/11. But there are others for whom altruism is an unknown concept. Self-interest is all they know. These people do not pause, they never do. They relentlessly press forward for any advantage under any circumstances. They see human suffering as a means to increase their personal power. These are the people who turn funerals into political rallies and feel no shame for doing it. As Americans burned to death, people like this swung into action immediately. They went on television with a partisan talking point. Climate change, they said, cause these fires. They didn't explain how exactly that happened. How did climate change do that? They didn't tell us but they just kept saying it. In the hands of Democratic politicians, climate change is like systemic racism in the sky. You can't see it, but rest assured, it's everywhere, and it's deadly. And like systemic racism, it is your fault. The American middle class did it. They caused climate change. They ate too many hamburgers. They drove too many SUVs. They had too many children. A lot of them wear t-shirts to work and didn't finish college and that causes climate change, too. And worst of all, some of them may vote for Donald Trump in November. And if there's anything that absolutely definitively causes climate change, and literally over a hundred percent of scientists agree with this established fact, it is voting for Donald Trump. You might as well start a tire fire in your yard. Joe Biden has checked the science and he agrees with this. Yesterday, the people on Biden's staff who understand the internet tweeted out an image of the wildfires along with this message, quote: \"Climate change is already here and we're witnessing its devastating effects every single day. We have to get President Trump out of the White House,\" end quote. So once again, by voting for Donald Trump, you are causing climate change which causes devastating fires. You by your vote have made hundreds of thousands of Oregonians homeless tonight. You've murdered people. Joe Biden's closest friend in the world, a prominent kite surfer on Martha's Vineyard called Barack Obama echoed that message with his trademark restraint. Obama declared that your life depends on voting for Joe Biden. Now, hold on a minute, you might ask, doesn't this very same Barack Obama own a $12 million spread right on the ocean in Massachusetts? At a time when sea levels are rising so fast we are about to see killer whales in the Rockies. Well, that doesn't make sense. It doesn't seem like Barack Obama could be very concerned about climate change. And by the way, didn't Obama go to law school? When did he become a scientist? Those seem like reasonable questions. On the other hand, lawyers pretending to be scientists are now everywhere in the Democratic Party. Here, for example, is the Governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee. Inslee is a proud graduate of Willamette University Law School. He is explaining he has already figured out the cause of the fires. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): And these are conditions that are exacerbated by the changing climate that we are suffering. And I do not believe that we should surrender these subdivisions or these houses to climate change exacerbated fires. We should fight the cause of these fires. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So I mismanaged my state, now it's on fire. You're required to give me more power. Right? You see how that works. But as a factual matter, this is a crock. There is not a single scientist on Earth who knows whether or by how much these fires may have been quote, \"exacerbated\" by warmer temperatures caused by climate change. All we have is conjecture from a handful of scientists and many politicians, none of whom has reached a definitive conclusion. Daniel Swain, for example, he is a climate scientist at UCLA conceded recently that it's, quote, \"hard to determine whether climate change played a role in sparking the fires.\" Okay. That's what science is. It's gradual. It's incremental. Often, it's tentative. We don't say things we don't know for certain. It's the opposite of politics. They have nothing in common. Meanwhile, back in the material world, investigators have determined that the massive Eldorado Fire in California which has towards nearly 14,000 acres, was caused by people setting off some kind of fireworks. And then on Wednesday, police announced that a criminal investigation is underway into the massive Alameda Fire in Ashland, Oregon, the southern part of the state. The Sheriff there said it's too early to say what caused the fire, but he did say human remains were found at the suspected origin of it. So nothing is being ruled out tonight, including arson. As always with these things, the more you know, the more facts the more details you know, the more complicated it becomes. So serious people -- and there are still some -- are just beginning to gather evidence to figure out how this started and thinking through how to prevent it going forward. But at the same time, unfortunately, our media are giving voice too deeply unserious people, partisan people and they are on television drowning out nuance. Don't worry about the facts, they say, just trust us. The sky is orange over San Francisco because households making 40 grand a year made the mistake of voting Republican. Therefore, you must give us total control of the nation's economy. The Green New Deal, it's mandatory now. Watch amateur arson detective, Nancy Pelosi explain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Mother Earth is angry. She is telling us -- whether she is telling us with hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, fires in the West, whatever it is that the climate crisis is real and has an impact. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Mother Nature is angry, please. When was the last time Nancy Pelosi went outside? Could she identify a single tree? No one asked her, of course. All we know is what she said, climate change caused this, and of course it did. Because no matter what the natural disaster is -- hurricanes, tornadoes, acne, whatever -- climate change did it. In other words, you did it. And to repent for doing it, you need to give us full control of your life. Now keep in mind, the person telling you this, Nancy Pelosi owns at least two subzero freezers. She showed them to us on television. Each one costs $10,000.00. They use a lot of energy. And like Barack Obama, like Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi constantly flies around the country privately, between her multimillion dollar estates. So if she cared about climate change, of course, she wouldn't be doing that. She doesn't, and neither do her supporters. Otherwise they'd be masked outside of her estates in anger. They wouldn't be trying to destroy the hair salon that exposed her hypocrisy. But it's not about science, it's certainly not about the Earth. Again, these are people who don't go outside who know nothing about nature. It's about blaming and ritually humiliating the American middle class for daring to elect someone they don't like. Joe Biden knows that the Pennsylvanians would be financially ruined by the fracking ban he supports are the same Pennsylvanians who flipped Pennsylvania red in 2016 for the first time in a generation. Think they're holding a grudge? You bet they are. One of the reasons Joe Biden doesn't go outside because his handlers won't allow him is because when he does, he has a tendency to show pure undisguised contempt for the middle class he supposedly care so deeply about. In 2019, you'll remember, he openly mocked coal miners. He suggested they just get programming jobs once they're all fired. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I come from a family where an area where there is coal mining in Scranton. Anybody could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mine sure in hell can learn how to program as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Learn to code. Hilarious. Joe Biden should learn to code. Keep us posted on how that goes. But there isn't time for that. The world is ending. There's no time to pause and savor the deep layers of hypocrisy here. Stop. We're too busy. We're measuring our lives in minutes now. Last summer, Sandy Cortez did the math on all of this. She is good at math, and she calculated we only have 12 years left to live. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change. Like this is the war. This is our World War II. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Yes, that sounds bad, and we're starting to wreck your night on a Friday, but actually, it's worse than that. Much worse than that. Consider this. Just four months after she gave us that warning, Sandy Cortez tweeted that we only have 10 years to cut carbon emissions in half. So think about that. We lost two years in just four months. At that rate, we could literally all be dead unless Joe Biden wins in November, which is of course, what they're saying underneath it all. On Tuesday, California Governor Gavin Newsom pretty much said it out loud. Newsom has abandoned science completely. He did it long ago. Science is too stringent for Gavin Newsom, too Western, too patriarchal. Newsom is now a man of faith. He has decided that climate change caused all of this and that's final. He's not listening to any other arguments. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I have no patience, and I say this lovingly not as an ideologue, but as someone who prides himself on being open to argument, interested in evidence, but I quite literally have no patience for climate change deniers. It simply follows completely inconsistent that point of view with the reality on the ground. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I'm not an ideologue, but anyone who disagrees with me must be ignored and eliminated. I don't want to hear any countervailing facts or evidence. None. But I'm not an ideologue. So people like Gavin Newsom has announced they don't want to listen to climate change deniers which raises the central question, what is a climate change denier? Well, a climate change denier is anyone who thinks a ruling class has done a very poor job running their states, running their country, protecting the people they were hired to protect and watch over. So are we climate change deniers if we point out that the State of California has failed to implement meaningful deforestation measures that might have dramatically slowed the spread of these wildfires? Does that make us deniers? Because in 2018, the state oversight agency in California found that years of poor or non-existent forest management policies in the Sierra Nevada forest had contributed to the fires. One of the few Republicans who still holds elected office in that state, State Assemblyman, Heath Flora, last year called on using the state's $22 billion budget surplus, probably the last one in its history to implement vegetation management because fires don't obviously spread as well if they're not connected by huge forests, which function as kindling. All of that is obvious, which means you can't say it out loud. The natural world facts nature itself is anathema to ideologues like this, the same people telling you they are protecting nature hate nature, everything about nature. Presumably you're also a climate change denier if you point out that six of the Oregon National Guard's wild firefighting helicopters aren't in Oregon anymore. Where are they, you might wonder? They're in Afghanistan. So instead of dropping water to suppress the blazes, this helicopters are busy supplying a war effort that's been going on for nearly 20 years for no reason. So how did that happen? And what's the effect of it? Those might be good questions to ask of, I don't know, Gavin Newsom, Jay Inslee, and the Governor of Oregon. Does anyone even care? And the answer, of course, is no. Nobody cares about the details at all. They don't care about the lives of the people they govern. They don't care about facts. They don't care about science. It was just last week that the mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti admitted on the record that LA has become completely third world, which it has, unfortunately. Of course, Garcetti didn't blame himself for the degradation of one of the great American cities that he runs. No, he blamed you. You did it, quote, \"It's almost 3 p.m.\" Garcetti tweeted, \"Time to turn off major appliances. Set the thermostat to 78 degrees or use a fan instead. Turn off excess lights and unplug any appliances you're not using. We need every Californian to help conserve energy. Please do your part.\" Oh, you've got to wonder if you were able to go to Garcetti's house which are not, can't get past the bodyguards you pay for. But if you were, is he following these recommendations? No. But it's not about him. It's about the people he is supposed to be helping. The ones he is now blaming. He wants them to suffer to fix a problem that he and his fellow Democrats in California created. Even now as residents are facing sweeping power outages in addition to the wildfires. In the meantime, Gavin Newsom has vowed that 50 percent of the energy in California, percent of their grid will be based on quote, \"renewable sources\" within a decade. That means sources like wind and solar power. The truth is, you can't dial up wind or solar in moments of extreme demand. Moments like right now, during the heatwave sweeping California. Gavin Newsom was asked last month whether he would consider revising his stance given that the blackouts have left millions of Californians without power and presumably killed people, because that's what happens when you don't have electricity. And Newsom responded this way, quote: \"We are going to radically change the way we produce and consume energy.\" In other words, no, we're not changing. In other words, the blackouts will continue until morale improves. So will the wildfires. Get used to it. California State Assemblyman James Gallagher represents Paradise, California where fires have destroyed thousands of structures this week. He joins us tonight. Mr. Gallagher, thanks so much for coming on. First. I'm so sorry about what has happened to your part of our biggest state, a beautiful state, my state. But let me ask you since your community has suffered, do you blame climate change for what's happened? JAMES GALLAGHER (R), CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLYMAN: Thank you, Tucker, for having me on. And yes, you know, our community is reeling once again from a devastating wildfire. And you know what troubles us the most, what angers us the most is that these fires are a disaster 40 years in the making, and you hit so many points in your monologue there that are right on. The Democrats who control this state who have been in charge of the legislature, who hold every statewide office have failed to take care of Forestry Management in California, and we have overgrown forests with brush piles 10 feet high, in some cases, dead and dying trees. And it's a tinderbox waiting for a spark. And we've had these wildfires that have killed my constituents, incinerated their homes and left our communities devastated. And then as you said, as you were talking about, we have Governor Newsom coming to my community today, and we were treated to Bernie Sanders last year when he was running for President who come and tell us that the problem is climate change, deflecting from the 40 years of mismanagement of our forest, of bad policies, of kowtowing to the big special interest in California, the Sierra Club, who said, we don't want one tree cut. It's this radical policy that is the cause of these fires and that is leading to people dying. And so you could imagine why, yes, we are very upset with how this policy has been carried out and the excuses, the deflections that are made that somehow it's our fault, right? That somehow it's because we live where we live. There were even people saying that we should, that Paradise should not rebuild. They should never live there in the first place, even though it's been a community for over a hundred years. There's people who chastise what kind of cars we drive, the lifestyle that that we live that that somehow that's our fault and not their policies, which have clearly been the cause of these devastating fires. CARLSON: What you're seeing is what you're seeing everywhere on every issue, which is class war. It's the people with the most deflecting all the blame downward toward the people with the least. And I'm sorry, you're on the wrong end of that tonight. James Gallagher, Assemblyman from California. Godspeed. Good luck, and I'm sorry again. GALLAGHER: Well, thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you. Well, the \"Tribute in Light: Memorializing 911\" in Manhattan tonight, up next we'll talk to our own Rick Leventhal. He was on the ground on Church Street in Lower Manhattan that day, 19 years ago, when the Twin Towers collapsed. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Hard to believe, but 9/11 was 19 years ago today. You may have woken up and thought where was I 19 years ago? Rick Leventhal knows for certain where he was. He was in Manhattan -- Lower Manhattan as the Towers came down. He joins us now to discuss today's Memorial in his own experiences there on Church Street 19 years ago. Rick, good to see you. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. Thank you. The worst day of most New Yorkers live certainly the toughest day of reporting I've ever experienced and today's ceremony obviously a bit different because of COVID. Family members and politicians gathered once again at Ground Zero to mark the moments the planes hit the towers and recognized the names of all the nearly 3,000 victims of the terror attack, but this year people stood six feet apart. They skipped the speeches and wore masks for the first time since first responders used them to protect themselves while clearing rubble from the smoking pile back in 2001. The twin Blue Beams known as the \"Tribute in Light\" are shining over the city again tonight. The 9/11 Memorial had said it would cancel that this year but quickly reversed that decision after hearing outrage from firefighters and police unions, and victims' families. As you said 19 years ago this morning, I raced down in Lower Manhattan while the Towers were still on fire and I had to run for cover when the first building fell and then again for the second. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: Oh yes. Oh, there it goes. There it goes. There it goes. Oh -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When it comes down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do need to put it down now. I think we need to put it down now. Here we go. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: It was chaotic. The phones weren't working. The information was scarce. It was incredibly unsettling because it felt like the world was ending, and one of the moments I'll never forget was interviewing Artie Forman who was working on a roof working on a roof across the street and witnessed both planes hit both towers and the unimaginable horrors that followed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: What's going through your mind when you see this happen? ARTIE FORMAN, CONSTRUCTION WORKER: You see bodies flying out of the sky and you can't do nothing about it. You tell me. You tell me what you think. I mean, my heart and my mouth. I mean, I pray for these people. There's no words to describe what's going on out there. I mean, you see bodies just coming -- a half hour later, they're still coming out of the goddamn sky. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: Of course, America responded with courage and strength embodied by the words of then President George W. Bush, who joined workers on the pile at the World Trade Center site. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: Two months later, I was on my way to Afghanistan for the first of several trips there and to Iraq to cover the brave Marines and soldiers fighting the war on terror. It's so amazing that it's been 19 years, Tucker. It feels like a lifetime ago and it feels like yesterday. CARLSON: I was thinking that exact thing. It brought it all back. I can't imagine how you feel watching that. Rick Leventhal, thank you so much for that. LEVENTHAL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: As you know, it is the 19th anniversary, Brett Eagleson will never forget that day. He lost his father on 9/11. He is part of a group of victims who lost family members that day who have sued Saudi Arabia for that country's alleged role in the attacks. A 2012 F.B.I. report found that Saudi officials provided financial support to two of the hijackers. Well, yesterday, it has been going on a long time -- but yesterday, a Federal Court in New York unsealed an order requiring Saudi officials including members of the Saudi Royal Family, including the longtime Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar to provide testimony about this report. This seems like a major legal win, and so we wanted to speak to Brett once again and we're doing that now. Brett, thanks so much for coming on tonight. Do you see this as a victory? Tell us what it means. BRETT EAGLESON, LOST FAMILY MEMBER DURING 9/11: Tucker, thank you again for having me on. And first and foremost, I just want to say my heart and prayers are out to all fellow 9/11 family members, first responders, and military. We love you. We appreciate you and thoughts and prayers are with you all. But Tucker, importantly tonight, we need to talk about a groundbreaking ruling that happened yesterday. It's earth shattering. It's monumentous for our case, we are winning. We are winning very, very hard right now. And the judge just granted us -- and this is a Federal judge, Tucker. So she does not take lightly the fact that she granted us the opportunity to depose 24 witnesses of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We're talking about members of the Royal Family, princess, Prince Bandar, Prince Aziz, the head of the Islamic Ministry -- you know, Islamic Ministry of affairs. That's equivalent to a Mike Pompeo or an A.G. Barr. So this is groundbreaking stuff. It's -- we are on the offensive for the first time in a long time. And you know, Tucker, I just want to say one thing, if I can, I'd like to address the President of the United States tonight, because I know he loves to watch your show. And, Mr. President, if you are watching, first and foremost, I want to thank you for having us at the White House last year. You're the first President that's ever done that, by the way, and I stood there and I shook your hand and I looked you in the eye and we told you our troubles and we told you everything that we're going through. And you said to us, Mr. President, keep going. Hit them hard. I'm behind you. I'm right with you all the way. Well, Mr. President, we did just what you said. We did keep going. We hit them hard. And we're at the point now where we've got the Saudis on the ropes. We're David and we've got Goliath on the ropes. And, Mr. President, we need help one last time. Help us get us over the finish line. Declassify these remaining documents, and I promise you, you will be a hero, not only to the 9/11 families, but to all of America for exposing the swamp for what it is. President Bush and President Obama gave us no help. They actually hindered us. President Obama vetoed JASTA, believe it or not. He tried to kill our lawsuit for this horrible Iranian deal. So Mr. President, you're our last and only hope. And please, please do the right thing. Make the Saudis see the light. You know, Mr. President that the Saudis want to have good relations with the United States and let this be a turning point for these relations, and please help us. CARLSON: I'm rooting for you. But I wish we had more time. If you ever find out why the U.S. government has continued to hide documents that would explain what happened in 9/11, I hope you'll come back and explain it to us because it's something I'm really interested in. EAGLESON: Tucker, and if you ever -- if you knew of any of that, Tucker, we are just flabbergasted as to why they kept them. CARLSON: You have a right to be because your government has let you down. It let all of us down. EAGLESON: Thank you again for having us, Tucker. I really, really appreciate it. I'll be happy to -- I'll be happy to come back. CARLSON: Thank you, Brett. Well, tonight a foreign company is threatening to destroy the largest salmon spawning ground in the world. It's in our country, it's in Alaska. So for people who actually care about nature and the environment, and that should be all of us. It's not about climate. It's about the material land and water that we're sovereign over. You should follow this. We're going to talk to a man who makes his living outdoors in Alaska after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: In Washington, strangely, the people who talk the most about the environment almost invariably are the people who know the least about the environment, who go outside the least, who care least about nature and are most likely to deny its imperatives. But nature is vital. It's the source of so much human happiness. And here's something if you care about nature, you should know about. Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of the wonders of the world, more salmon spawn there than any place on the planet. Now a Canadian company is trying to build an open pit mine there. An E.P.A. review found that mine would be devastating potentially for the ecosystem, for nature. There would be some mining jobs, but fewer than you think and they would be automated and time limited. The mine if built is expected to create jobs only for about 20 years. Whereas the damage the mine cause could last forever. So at this point, the White House has delayed approval for building this mind, the Pebble Mine. Should the White House cancel it entirely? Brian Kraft knows a lot about this area and a lot about nature. He is the owner of the Alaska Sportsman's Lodge. We're happy to have him on tonight. Brian, thanks so much for coming on. BRIAN KRAFT, OWNER, ALASKA SPORTSMAN'S LODGE: Hi. Thanks for having me on, Tucker. CARLSON: Tell us about this part of the world where you live and work. Why is it important? KRAFT: Well, it's a remote part of Alaska, Southwest Alaska known as the Bristol Bay Area. It is home to salmon runs that are measured by the millions. There's no roads, no real infrastructure. It's in a pristine, completely intact nature functioning as it has for a millennium. So it's a perfectly functioning ecosystem with healthy fisheries. CARLSON: So you run a business, presumably you're not against business. You're in rural areas where there aren't enough jobs. Presumably, you're sympathetic to the idea of creating more jobs. I'm assuming all of this, but I think it's probably right. So tell us about -- assess the argument that we need Pebble Mine because the economy needs Pebble Mine. KRAFT: Well, the economy and Bristol Bay is driven by salmon and the salmon runs are very strong and very healthy. We've got a thriving commercial salmon fishery that feeds the world. We've got a thriving sport fishery that people come from all over the world to experience and we've got a thriving ecotourism industry as well. And then you have the local people that have lived there for millions or thousands of years and are sustained by the salmon runs. So there is an economy that's functioning right now. And all we have to do is take care of it, and putting a big hole, a big mine at the headwaters of some of the salmon streams that originate and create this habitat is not a really good idea. You know, and originally, Tucker, I was all for this. I first heard about this proposal. I am pro-business and just like many Alaskans up here, we understand resource development and resource extraction economy up here, by and large, so I got it, I understood that, hey, this could create jobs, this could be a good opportunity. But then just like many Alaskans, the more we looked at it and the more we studied it, we found out this isn't the right location. Unfortunately, this location is too sensitive and I think that's what the administration has come away with, too. They've looked at it. They've gone through the process. They've gone through the EIS Program with the Army Corps of Engineers, come to finally EIS situation where they go, you know what, there's adverse consequences to going forward with it as planned and we can't allow that to happen. CARLSON: Amen. So many of these conversations, these debates about the environment take place between people who know nothing about it, and so we're just grateful to have someone like you, Brian, who lives there and spends his life there assess it for us. Thanks a lot for coming on tonight. I appreciate it. KRAFT: Thanks for having me, Tucker. Big fan. Appreciate it. CARLSON: Thanks. Well, a Los Angeles County Health official has admitted she does not want to reopen schools until the presidential election. There's a little science for you. She said that on tape. We will play it for you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Over the past several weeks, we showed you many videos of Joe Biden voters wearing BLM t-shirts terrorizing people in their homes. Democratic politicians in the media who help them pretend they don't encourage this. It's terrorism, obviously, but they're not for it. Notice they never condemn it though. Well last month, in August, a Democrat running for the statehouse in Minnesota, a man called John Thompson made it a little harder to pretend that Democrats aren't for this. Thompson was videotape outside the home of the Minneapolis Police Union President, Bob Kroll. He was threatening Kroll and the city with violence. We played you the tape. At one point, Thompson beat effigies of Kroll and his wife, he beat them like pinatas. Watch this. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] CARLSON: What country is this? This is totally cool though according to the Minneapolis newspaper, \"The Star Tribune.\" Their Editorial Board remarked that Thompson was just quote, \"stoked and amped up.\" Thompson may need to work on quote, \"funneling his emotions,\" the Editorial Board conceded, but quote, \"We can understand his tornadic style.\" Assuming that's a word. Meanwhile, Ken Martin, he is the state party chairman, Democratic Party, said the party doesn't condone Thompson's rhetoric, but the party is, quote, \"grateful for his work against racism.\" Apparently beating effigies is part of that. In other words, maybe next time Thompson should beat only one effigy instead of two. Thompson is not alone. He's not an outlier by the way. He reflects his party and he reflects his base both of which routinely claim to be terrorized in order to justify their own terrorism. That's not sustainable. You can't have a country like that. No party that tolerates this kind of terrorism belongs in government. Period. And today, a police union in Minnesota finally realized that and pulled its endorsement of several Democratic legislators. If they don't want more people like John Thompson outside their homes, maybe more civic organizations should do the same. Thompson isn't the only public figure who has been letting the mask slip recently. This week, a recording surfaced showing LA County Public Health Director, Dr. Barbara Ferrer saying that the state's largest county won't reopen its schools until -- guess -- after the presidential election. In other words, these are political lockdowns. Your kids are pawns of the Democratic Party. Listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DR. BARBARA FERRER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR: We don't realistically anticipate that we would be moving to either tier two or to be opening K through 12 schools at least during -- at least until after the election. It seems to us a more realistic approach to this would be to think that we are going to be where we are now until we get after -- until we are done with the elections. (END AUDIO CLIP) CARLSON: So officials in LA are saying no, Democrats. Oh, that's not a big deal. They're saying the Dr. Ferrer just happened to pick the election out of a hat. I just happened to pick it. Right. Marc Siegel is a physician. He's a FOX News medical contributor. We're happy to have him on tonight to assess -- Doctor. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, I call this election infection. The election is infecting, right, not the virus. CARLSON: Yes. SIEGEL: And in terms of Dr. Ferrer, she is not really a doctor. Like Tedros of the W.H.O., she calls herself a doctor, but she's not a physician. So I have three things I want her to think about tonight. One is education. The second is public health. The third is money. Dr. Farrer, education, can you imagine starting in November? Let's talk about geometry. You start with the square but never get to the cube. How about American History, Dr. Ferrer? You start with the revolution, but you never get past World War I. And what about public health? What about the interaction between kids? What about having nurses look after the medical issues with kids? What about special needs? What about nutrition? And then thirdly, what about money? Barons is studying the lost appearance, being out of work because of all our schools closing in the United States, it would cost $700 billion to the U.S. economy. Over here in New York, Tucker, we have Mayor de Blasio saying the schools are going to open, the schools are going to be open, but if you look next to him, you see an election countdown calendar. He has got the same thing going on here. And meanwhile, teachers in New York are saying, hey, we've got no masks. Hey, we've got no protocol. We've got no plan in place. How can we possibly reopen? What are we going to do? We're not coming in, the teachers who saying. So Tucker, I'm not a betting man. But I have a wager tonight that I'd like to share with you. I've got a special date in mind when the schools in New York might open and my bet, I want to see if you agree with this, my bet is November 3rd -- Tucker. CARLSON: Unfortunately, Doctor, I'm not going to take that bet because I think you're probably right. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for that assessment. SIEGEL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Up next, the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange face up to 175 years in prison if he is extradited to the United States. For what exactly? Why are they trying to put Julian Assange in prison for life? We should know. Glenn Greenwald joins us after the break to tell us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange has been held in a high security prison since he was arrested last spring at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he effectively was held for many years in isolation. His extradition hearing is now finally underway. Assange's lawyer estimates he could face 175 years in prison if he is extradited to the United States. He faces espionage charges here. WikiLeaks exposed all kinds of things, some of which it was good to know, including corruption by the Democratic National Committee in 2016. So what is the story on Julian Assange? Why is the D.O.J. pursuing this case so aggressively? Glenn Greenwald has followed this from the very beginning. He's, of course, a journalist, founder of \"The Intercept\" and we're happy to have him tonight. So Glenn, thanks for coming on. I think a lot of people have heard for years that Julian Assange is a bad guy who hurt the United States. Now the United States is going to bring justice in this case. What's your view of this? Tell us what we should know in three minutes about Julian Assange? GLEN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDER, THE INTERCEPT: Let's remember, Tucker, that the criminal investigation into Julian Assange began by the Obama administration because in 2010, WikiLeaks published a slew of documents, none of which harmed anybody, not even the government claims that that was very embarrassing to the Obama administration that revealed all kinds of abuses and lies that they were telling about these endless wars, that the Pentagon and the C.I.A. are determined to fight. They were embarrassing to Hillary Clinton. And so, they conducted -- they initiated a grand jury investigation to try and prosecute him for reporting to the public. He worked with \"The New York Times\" and \"The Guardian\" to publish very embarrassing information about the endless war machine, about the neocons who are working in the Obama administration. To understand what's happening here, we can look at a very similar case, which is one that President Trump recently raised, which is the prosecution by the Obama administration as well of Edward Snowden for the same reason that he exposed the lies that James Clapper told. He exposed how there is this massive spying system that the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. control that they can use against American citizens and obviously this isn't coming from President Trump. He praised WikiLeaks in 2016 for informing the public. He knows firsthand how these spying systems that Edward Snowden exposed can be abused and were abused in 2016. This is coming from people who work in the C.I.A., who work in the Pentagon, who insist on endless war and who believe that they are a government unto themselves more powerful than the President. I posted this weekend a speech from Dwight Eisenhower warning that this military industrial complex, what we now call the Deep State is becoming more powerful than the President. Chuck Schumer warned right before President Trump took office that President Trump challenging the C.I.A. was foolish because they have many ways to get back at anybody who impedes them. That's what these cases are about Tucker. They're punishing Julian Assange and trying to punish Edward Snowden for informing the public about things they have the right to know about the Obama administration. They're basically saying to President Trump, you don't run the country even though you were elected. We do and they're daring him to use his part in power to put an end to these very abusive prosecutions one which resulted in eight years of punishment for Julian Assange for telling the truth, the other one which resulted in seven years of exile for Edward Snowden, of being in Russia simply for informing the public and embarrassing political officials who are very powerful. CARLSON: So in 30 seconds, the President could pardon Julian Assange right now and end this, is that correct? GREENWALD: He could have pardoned him and Edward Snowden and there's widespread support across the political spectrum on both the right and the left for doing both. It would be politically advantageous for the President. The only people who would be angry would be Susan Rice, John Brennan, Jim Comey and James Clapper because they're the ones who both of them exposed. CARLSON: Well, that's the most powerful summary I've ever heard of that story. Glenn Greenwald, thank you very much for that. GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: We're out of time, but on our way out tonight, into the weekend, we want to give you one last look at the \"Tribute in Light\" remembering every American, we lost thousands of them on 9/11 nineteen years ago today.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden visits Kenosha, Wisconsin ahead of Trump's trip to Pennsylvania; analysis from Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier. Politics is a lot like baseball. But thanks to the news media, press conferences with presidential candidates have turned into a predictable mix of hardball and wiffle ball. It all depends on which candidate the \u201cjournalists\u201d support. Compare two recent press conferences. Both President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were gearing up for their trips to riot-torn Kenosha, Wisconsin. Only Trump was the target of fastball after fastball. Every journalist pitch was designed to make him strike out \u2014 or to flat out bean him. WASHINGTON POST PIECE PANNED FOR SPECULATING ONLY A 'BIDEN LANDSLIDE' WOULD PREVENT 'VIOLENCE' BEYOND ELECTION Reporters raised questions about whether Trump\u2019s arrival \u201ccould exacerbate tensions and increase violence.\u201d Then they pressed him to see why he wouldn\u2019t meet with \u201cthe family of Jacob Blake,\u201d the man shot following a fight with police. It only got worse from there. The press did just that, press Trump all over the field. The six minutes of questions were reminiscent of baseball\u2019s beanball wars. Several reporters aimed their pitches right (er, left) at the president. In short, another typical day at the ballpark. The news media teamed up against Trump and he smacked what they threw at him like a political Babe Ruth. CNN was the worst, naturally. Their White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins threw hers straight out of left field. She was trying to tie Trump to the violence of Portland, where leftists have rioted for nearly 100 days. She asked, or argued, \u201cBut I notice you did not mention that your supporters were also in Portland this weekend, firing paintball guns at people, some form of pepper spray. So do you want to also take this chance to condemn what your supporters did in Portland?\u201d CNN'S BROOKE BALDWIN PRAISED BIDEN DURING KENOSHA VISIT: HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT FOR 'THE SOUL OF THIS NATION' Trump hit that pitch out of the park. He noted, \u201cpaint is a defensive mechanism; paint is not bullets.\u201d Then he went for the grand slam, connecting the rioters to the press. \u201cYour supporters \u2014 your supporters \u2014 and they are your supporters, indeed \u2014 shot a young gentleman who \u2014 and killed him \u2014 not with paint, but with a bullet. And I think it\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d In all, Collins tried to link Trump\u2019s \u201csupporter\u201d or \u201csupporters\u201d to violence seven separate times. She also tried to shout over Trump, but her mask muffled the sound and Trump easily dodged the beanballs. MSNBC'S JOY REID SAYS 'BLM DOESN'T RIOT,' BLAMES TRUMP FOR ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE FUELED BY 'WHITE NATIONALIST MOBS' In short, another typical day at the ballpark. The news media teamed up against Trump and he smacked what they threw at him like a political Babe Ruth. Now compare that to the Biden presser held just two days later. There were no brushback pitches, no beanballs. And nothing that a 77-year-old man couldn\u2019t easily handle. Everything was about decorum. None of the reporters talked over Biden. In fact, they said \u201cthank you\u201d to him five separate times. That\u2019s a word none of them uttered during the Trump presser. The questions began with deference, unlike with how they addressed Trump. \u201cVice President, two quick questions for you if I may,\u201d started off the presser. Then, just as the reporters had done for Trump, they threw the pitches in from left field. The press was always trying to drive the narrative to benefit liberal politics. Even though a reporter admitted that locals didn\u2019t want Biden in Kenosha, the way he was asked about it was almost gentle. \u201cWhy is now the right time for you to go to Kenosha And what do you hope to accomplish tomorrow?\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER That easy pitch was followed by one even easier, but still pushing the liberal ideal, hoping Biden might take an intentional walk from the debates. \u201cIs there anything, you've said you'll participate, is there anything that could dissuade you from participating and how have you began to prepare?\u201d The questions tried to help Biden frame his responses. When asked about violence in Kenosha, he was reminded of the Democrat talking point, \u201cobviously you are not president now and Donald Trump is.\u201d Not that the rioters who burned down much of the city were Biden\u2019s \u201csupporters,\u201d to use the CNN word. They didn\u2019t ask that. The game ended with a reporter giving Biden a chance to tout his fund-raising success. \u201cYou raised $364.5 million, your campaign and the DNC last month, record for a monthly haul, apparently. How are you going to spend it?\u201d To which Biden jokingly asked the reporter to dinner. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This wasn\u2019t ever competitive. It was an exhibition among people who are all on the same team. Biden should be used to it. These are the same pitches the press threw to his old boss President Barack Obama for eight years. Journalists are already proving that\u2019s the kind of bush league play we can expect if Biden wins.

Former New York City mayor and billionaire Democratic bundler Mike Bloomberg is set to address the Democratic National Convention (DNC) Thursday amid resentment over an alleged lack of financial commitment to the party\u00a0so far in the election cycle and criticism of the former Republican's\u00a0\"stop-and-frisk pioneer\" past. Bloomberg\u00a0left the GOP in 2007 and became a Democrat in 2018. When\u00a0he\u00a0ran for the party's presidential nomination this cycle, he gave the impression that he would be willing to crack open his enormous piggy bank to give Democrats a significant financial edge in the 2020 election cycle. \"Mike Bloomberg is either going to be the nominee or the most important person supporting the Democratic nominee for president,\u201d Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg's campaign manager, told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in January.\u00a0\u201cHe is dedicated to getting Trump out of the White House.\u201d Former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg speaks during a campaign rally at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., Tuesday, March 3, 2020. Bloomberg's inclusion in the 2020 DNC lineup has outraged many of the party's progressives (Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald via AP) DEMS SAY BLOOMBERG NOT HELPING 2020 CAMPAIGN AS MUCH AS PROMISED: REPORT After dissolving his presidential campaign he transferred $18 million to the party, the largest transfer of its kind to-date. And just this week he pledged $60 million to help House Democrats in the November election. He also committed roughly $35 million to the pro-Democratic data consulting firm Hawkfish. But Bloomberg, who remains a prolific donor for Democrats -- NPR reported he'd spent $350 million this election cycle as of late July --\u00a0has not done enough, according to many on the left. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) still maintain a cash edge as the campaign heads into its final stages. There was speculation earlier this year that Bloomberg\u00a0could be willing to drop $1 billion through the summer and fall in an effort to defeat President Trump -- approximately the same amount of money he spent\u00a0on his failed presidential campaign. That has not materialized, and neither have the payments to his former campaign staffers who he promised during his campaign to keep on the payroll with benefits until the November election.\u00a0A field organizer even filed a class-action lawsuit over the layoffs. \"He stiffed our party and all the monthly workers he promised to keep on through November,\" progressive activist Amy Siskind said on Twitter when Bloomberg's inclusion in the DNC lineup was announced.\u00a0\"Why is Bloomberg speaking?\" Bloomberg's record as a mayor has been under the microscope as well. It was one of the issues that eventually sunk his campaign. MIKE BLOOMBERG PLEDGES $60M TO HELP HOUSE DEMOCRATS WIN IN NOVEMBER \"'We can\u2019t just say the words Black Lives Matter'\u00a0says mayor who endorsed stop and frisk pioneer Mike Bloomberg,\" Hill TV host Krystal Ball said Monday in response to a speech by Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who endorsed Bloomberg's White House bid. She added Tuesday: \"Democrats are treating progressives and young people as cater waiters, there to serve hors d\u2019oeuvres to the Republicans, billionaires, and former office holders who are the real guests.\" Nelini Stamp, part of the progressive Working Families Party that backs progressive Democrats, also expressed outrage at Bloomberg's inclusion in as a speaker last week when he was announced. WILL BLM HAVE ROLE AT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION? PROGRAM REFLECTS TENSIONS WITH MOVEMENT \"Legit ridiculous,\" she said. \"Especially having someone like Mike Bloomberg who cough cough as a reminder stop & frisked Black and Latino youth in the city of NY for years!\" Bloomberg, during his campaign, said that he \"inherited\" stop-and-frisk and cut it back as mayor, and apologized for not doing so \"faster and sooner.\" And there are, of course, more than 70 days until the presidential election and Bloomberg could still make a splash with a large financial commitment. He'll also have the chance to mend fences with his critics during his address Thursday. Nevertheless, the consternation over Bloomberg's appearance is a microcosm of the larger tension between party progressives and the Democratic establishment over a perceived lack of respect for\u00a0the party's far-left wing. That dynamic\u00a0has boiled over with complaints about the brevity of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's one-minute speaking slot, progressive recoiling to nominee Joe Biden's comment that \"most cops are good,\" and a number of DNC delegates vowing not to vote to approve the party's platform because it does not include \"Medicare-for-All.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Michael Bloomberg, the architect of stop-and-frisk, is speaking at the DNC and Jamaal Bowman, who was stopped and frisked under Bloomberg, is not,\" Justice Democrats spokesman Waleed Shahid said Monday. Bowman is the New York congressional candidate backed by the far-left Justice Democrats organization who upset powerful Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., in a primary earlier this year. \"[W]hat\u2019s clear from this week\u2019s lineup is that the DNC isn\u2019t looking toward the future, but straight at the past,\" Rebecca Traister wrote for The Cut\u00a0in a piece\u00a0slamming the party for not including people like Bowman and fellow Justice Democrat Cori Bush, who beat longtime Missouri Rep. Lacy Clay in a primary just weeks ago, in its programming. Fox News Paul Steinhauser, Kelly Phares and\u00a0Andrew O'Reilly\u00a0contributed to this report.",

A woman who said she was in the car that drove through a group of protesters in New York's Times Square, described\u00a0being\u00a0harassed before getting into the vehicle and later receiving death threats. A video of the incident shows\u00a0a Ford Taurus driving through a crowd of Black Lives Matter\u00a0protesters, including people appearing to block the vehicle with bicycles, during a rainy Thursday evening.

I do not know what these people care about, but they do not care about human lives.\" One unidentified protester told WABC-TV the driver of the vehicle tried going through a red light. \"If you go through a red light when there are people in the crosswalk, you are accepting the chance that you hit somebody,\" the protester said. WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE Germanotta,\u00a0who has been arrested several times for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower, was part of a handful of Trump supporters staging a counter-demonstration. She said her group was told by police to leave the area just after 8 p.m.\u00a0No one has come forward to complain of any injuries from the incident, WABC-TV reported. Many speculated the car was an unmarked New York police vehicle, which the NYPD later disputed. However, the license plate matched a\u00a0Ford Taurus police interceptor linked to pro-police activist Hakim Gibson, Gothamist reported. The publication said Facebook posts by Gibson indicated the car was purchased at an auction and outfitted with a\u00a0push bumper and spotlight.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump touts criminal justice reform and economic success during an exclusive interview with Harris Faulkner. EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign posted their largest online fundraising day ever on Sunday, bringing in $14 million across three entities on the president's birthday \u2014\u00a0smashing their previous online fundraising record of $10 million on Oct. 19, 2016. The surge in cash comes as Republicans' war chest continues to dwarf Democrats' holdings, as it has for the entire primary cycle. Trump and the RNC \u2013 which have been building a fundraising juggernaut for more than three years \u2013 have roughly $255 million cash on hand,\u00a0compared with\u00a0the approximately $100 million the Joe Biden campaign and DNC have in their coffers. A competitive primary with numerous candidates on the Democratic side essentially stalled their effort to consolidate donations for months. The RNC, along with the Trump Make America Great Again Committee\u00a0(TMAGAC) and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. (DJTP), received an average online gift of $46, Fox News is told. Trump turned 74 on Sunday. GOP ENJOYS TWO-TO-ONE CASH ADVANTAGE OVER DEMS, SPENDS BIG ON ADS \u201cEnthusiasm for President Trump continues to be our greatest motivator and political weapon,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News. \"Republicans are thinking smarter digitally and harnessing support and energy for President Trump to up our online fundraising game and outwork, outdo, and outmaneuver the Democrats at every turn.\" The largest-ever\u00a0total 24-hour haul for the campaign was recorded the day Trump launched his reelection campaign last year, bringing in nearly $25 million. The birthday windfall marks the largest online fundraising figure. The RNC-Trump campaign\u2019s online birthday card campaign for the president\u00a0received 1\u00a0million signatures alone. \"The grassroots support behind President Trump\u2019s re-election is something no campaign has ever seen.\" Biden continues to lead Trump in most national polling, as well as in key battlegrounds. But Trump has sought to more aggressively head back out on the campaign trail amid the coronavirus pandemic, scheduling his first rally in months this coming weekend. The former vice president's glitch-prone livestreamed events, meanwhile, have attracted a relatively small number of viewers, and surveys appear to reflect what the president's campaign calls an enthusiasm gap.\u00a0According to an\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post poll\u00a0earlier this year, 53\u00a0percent of Trump supporters say they\u2019re \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about supporting the president, but only 24\u00a0percent of those backing Biden say the same\u00a0about supporting the former vice president. \u201cThe grassroots support behind President Trump\u2019s reelection is something no campaign has ever seen,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told Fox News. \"Just as more than a million people have registered for tickets to the President\u2019s rally this weekend [in Oklahoma], they are also donating to help his campaign in record numbers. There is an enthusiasm gap - it is real and it is wide. President Trump\u2019s supporters would run through a brick wall to vote for him. Nobody is running through a brick wall for Joe Biden.\u201d DEMS CHEERING 'BLM' PROTESTS NOW SAY TRUMP RALLIES POSE CORONAVIRUS RISK President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House. Trump will hold his first campaign in several weeks in Tulsa, Okla., next week. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Some Biden supporters have indicated they understand the\u00a0enthusiasm issue in the race. Fox News reported exclusively last week that top Biden\u00a0surrogate\u00a0Terry McAuliffe recently told a videoconference meeting of Virginia\u00a0Democrats that Biden should remain in his basement -- where he has campaigned remotely during the coronavirus pandemic --\u00a0and that Democratic officials are broadly \"preferring\" that Biden stay out of the limelight. Fox News\u00a0obtained a video of McAuliffe's Norfolk comments, which came after Biden has made a\u00a0series of gaffes\u00a0in his already-limited public appearances as he social distanced from home\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including by\u00a0declaring\u00a0that African-Americans\u00a0who support Trump \"ain\u2019t black.\" WATCH: TOP DEM SAYS BIDEN SHOULD REMAIN IN BASEMENT \"People say all the time, 'Oh, we got to get the vice president out of the basement,'\" McAuliffe told the\u00a0\"monthly breakfast\"\u00a0of the\u00a0Norfolk City Democratic Committee. \"He's fine in the basement. Two people see him a day: his two body people. That's it. Let Trump keep doing what Trump's doing.\" Trump, for his part, has dealt with a series of controversies concerning his handling of the unrest following the death of George Floyd, including the decision to clear a park by the White House of protesters ahead of a photo op. McAuliffe served as campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run. At the Zoom videoconference, he was introduced by a senior Norfolk Democrat,\u00a0Charlie Stanton, who compared soldiers who participated in the D-Day landing to\u00a0modern-day Antifa members. \"It's hard for the vice president to break through,\" McAuliffe told the group. \"You've got the COVID crisis. He's not a governor, doesn't have the National Guard. He's not the president, doesn't have the briefing room. He needs to come out strategically. And when he says something like he did on race relations two days ago, it needs to have a big impact -- thoughtful, and that's what we're preferring that he actually do at the time.\" But, McAuliffe conceded, \"We're building the digital today, which Trump has a huge lead on, he's got like 88 million Twitter followers, so that's a big emphasis for us.\" Also on Sunday, Trump Victory, the joint field effort between the RNC and the Trump campaign, celebrated what they called a\u00a0\u201csummer kick off\u201d with a National Weekend of Action in states across the country. INSIDE A MASSIVE EFFORT TO DEPLATFORM 'BLACK LIVES MATTER' CRITICS Volunteers across the country were coming out to show their support and \"celebrate [Trump's] birthday by knocking on doors (in states that allowed) and making phone calls,\" the RNC said.

For weeks, Portland\u00a0Mayor Ted Wheeler and the mainstream media have been downplaying the violence and chaos emanating from the Black Lives Matter protests\u00a0taking place in front of the city's federal courthouse, documentary filmmaker\u00a0Ami Horowitz\u00a0told Fox News, calling it \"media malpractice.\" Horowitz, who\u00a0previously covered the Minneapolis protests in the wake of George Floyd's death and Seattle's Capitol Hill Organized Protest area, spoke to\u00a0demonstrators who have protesting for\u00a0weeks outside Portland's Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse, at one point vandalizing and attempting to\u00a0set the building on fire. They were also seen throwing knives and using fireworks against federal law enforcement sent to defend the building. According to Horowitz, they aim \"to encourage societal breakdown\" so they can rebuild it. US ATTORNEY FOR OREGON BLASTS PORTLAND OFFICIALS IN BLISTERING INTERVIEW: 'NONSENSICAL, POLITICAL THEATER' \"I saw many members of the press who had their cameras down when the protesters/rioters were ravaging the federal building, but when the federal agents came out of the courthouse, all of the sudden, their cameras are rolling,\" the filmmaker told Fox News. In a pair of tweets\u00a0Monday night,\u00a0President Trump\u00a0slammed \"deranged Anarchists & Agitators\"\u00a0rioting\u00a0in Portland and other cities, while claiming that if presumptive Democratic nominee\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0wins the November election, the country would descend into chaos. Demonstrators draw a peace sign in front of a fire during a Black Lives Matter protest at the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse Tuesday, July 28, 2020, in Portland, Ore.\u00a0 (AP) Howowitz went on to say: \"Many of them were hardcore rioters who were using pipes, hammers, and even golf clubs to break down the protective shielding of the building and to bust through,\" he explained. \"They repeatedly used incendiary devices in order to create multiple fires in the hope of burning the building down and everyone inside.\" INSIDE NIGHTLY SIEGE FACED BY FEDS IN PORTLAND: REPORTERS DETAIL ATTACKS ON OFFICERS The\u00a0\"U.N.

Hatfield United States Courthouse Monday, July 27, 2020, in Portland, Ore.\u00a0 (AP) \"Only when the federal building was in danger of burning down and its occupants were threatened, did the federal officers come out to extinguish the threat and did so as humanely possible, using tear gas, pepper spray, and other non-lethal means, even after they were attacked with glass, bottles\u00a0and rocks,\" he said. Portland's City Council has\u00a0banned\u00a0its\u00a0police from working with federal law enforcement. \"At one point I was hit by a propelled gas canister. There were groups of people interrogating journalists. They warned me that if I portrayed the protesters in a negative light, I would face 'street justice,'\" Horowitz said.\u00a0\"And after being recognized, I was pelted with broken glass.\" Demonstrators sit and kneel as tear gas fills the air during a Black Lives Matter protest at the Mark O.

PROTESTS FLARE UP IN TEMPE, ARIZ., AND AUSTIN, TEXAS - AS PORTLAND SEES ITS 61ST CONSECUTIVE NIGHT OF UNREST When Horowitz asked if violence was needed, a female protester responded: \"You gotta have violence.\" \"There's four levels of protest,\" the Black woman explained. \"Looting and rioting is part of protesting. So yes, I do agree that it needs to be there.\" \"This is us taking the high road,\" another woman\u00a0said.\u00a0\"This is us not creating groups to kill off and assassinate the people that are doing the same to us,\" a masked woman told him. \"This is us just trying to create a world filled with love and kill off the hate.\" But not everyone there agreed with the violence. \"I don't think y'all really know what you're fighting for,\" a Black man told Horowitz, pointing out that only \"two percent\" of the protesters were Black. \"And then when everybody gets to go home, we stay Black,\" he said, \"and we\u00a0get blamed for your Black Lives f---ing\u00a0Matter ... this is B.S.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mayor Wheeler, along with the Democratic mayors of other cities stricken by violence in recent weeks, signed a letter to congressional leaders Monday that demanded they pass a bill banning the Trump administration from sending federal officers to cities without local consent. \"[W]e are outraged that the administration has responded to these First Amendment-protected gathering by authorizing the deployment of riot-gear-clad forces to Washington, D.C., Portland, Seattle and other communities across the country without the consent of local authorities,\" the letter read. \"As demonstrated now in Portland, these federal forces have used the pretext of protecting federal property to also patrol streets, way outside of their lawful jurisdiction, arrest residents without cause and trample on Constitutional rights.\"",

            "article_content": "Postmaster General testifies before Senate committee; Chad Pergram reports. Six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Friday against\u00a0Postmaster General Louis DeJoy alleging new \"unlawful\" mail policy changes have affected their ability to conduct \"free and fair elections.\" The states allege that DeJoy's efforts to cut costs have led to significant mail delays across the country and jeopardize the Nov.\u00a03 general election where\u00a0more Americans than ever will cast their ballots by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic. SEN. CARPER YELLS EXPLETIVES AT DEJOY HEARING WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE WITH HIS VIDEO FEED The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Pennsylvania, quotes heavily from President Trump's tweets over his opposition\u00a0to mail-in voting and asks the court to reverse mail service changes implemented by DeJoy, a GOP donor and Trump ally, and declare them unlawful. \"Defendants have abruptly and unlawfully impaired the operation of the postal services and have acted to cast doubt on the Postal Service's ability to facilitate mail-in voting,\" the lawsuit alleges. Pennsylvania, California, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts,\u00a0North Carolina and the District of Columbia jointly filed the suit. In addition to DeJoy, the lawsuit names the United States Postal Service and Robert Duncan, chairman of the USPS Board of Governors, as defendants. On Tuesday, 14 other states filed a lawsuit against Trump, DeJoy and the USPS in federal court in Washington state alleging the postal changes could undermine the 2020 election. The states suing in that lawsuit are Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin and Virginia. POSTMASTER GENERAL, IN SENATE HEARING, AIMS TO CALM FEARS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS BEING DELIVERED LATE The new lawsuit alleges violations to the Postal Reorganization Act for making policy changes without first submitting the proposal to the\u00a0Postal Regulatory Commission,\u00a0violations to the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution for interfering in how states conduct elections and violations of the 26th Amendment of the Constitution for \"significantly and disproportionately\" harming older voters who are more likely to vote by mail due to health risks\u00a0from COVID-19. In this image from video, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testifies during a video virtual hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on the U.S. Postal Service during COVID-19 and the upcoming elections, Friday, Aug. 21, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington. (US Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs via AP) \"The service delays caused by\u00a0Postal Service's implementation of sweeping new policies in the midst of a pandemic may disenfranchise voters because their ballots will not be sent or received in time and may deter people from voting because they do not trust that their ballot will be delivered,\" the lawsuit says. Among the policy changes the lawsuit seeks to reverse are: prohibiting late or extra trips by postal workers \"that are often necessary to keep the mail moving forward in the mainstream,\" requiring mail carriers to adhere rigidly to start and stop times regardless of whether all the mail on their route has been delivered, limiting the use of overtime and no longer giving election materials\u00a0the highest priority regardless of the class of mail it was sent. LOUIS DEJOY: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE POSTMASTER GENERAL Amid nationwide concern about mail delays, and\u00a0even protests outside his DC home, DeJoy announced Tuesday his cost-cutting measures would be put on hold. \"To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,\" DeJoy said in a statement. Democrats, however, said DeJoy didn't go far enough and the House will vote Saturday on legislation to undo his operational changes and provide $25 billion in funding for the USPS. DeJoy appeared before the Senate Homeland Security Committee Friday where he sought to reassure lawmakers election ballots\u00a0will be counted if received within seven days of the election. \"As we head into this election season, I want to assure this committee and the American public that the Postal Service is fully capable and committed\u00a0to delivering the nation's election mail securely and on time. This sacred duty is my number one priority between now and election day,\" DeJoy said. He added: \"The women and men of the Postal Service have demonstrated extraordinary commitment for our mission throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In every community in America, we continue to work to keep our employees and customers safe as we fulfill our essential role depending medications, benefit checks and financial statements the public depends upon.\" Fox News' Tyler Olsen and Lissa Kaplan contributed to this report.",

Getting ready to show up to the polls on Tuesday decked out in your favorite candidates\u2019 swag? You may need to reconsider.

But many states also have laws related to \u201cpassive electioneering,\u201d which can include wearing a T-shirt with a candidate\u2019s name. There are 37 states that prohibit campaign signs and literature from polling places, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan, nongovernment organization\u00a0\u00a0And at least 21 states have restrictions specifically relating to apparel at the polls, with 15 prohibiting it. While the laws differ in each of those states, most prohibit wearing or displaying anything with a candidate\u2019s name or other references to a candidate or political issue. That means wearing any Trump or Biden gear \u2014 or even swag from a local candidate \u2014 is a no-no at polling places in those states.

California\u2019s elections code prohibits items with a candidate\u2019s name, likeness or logo\u00a0but does allow slogans. The state\u2019s elections chief even put out a notice in September letting county clerks know that slogans including \u201cMake America Great Again (MAGA), Black Lives Matter (BLM), Keep America Great (KAG), Vote for Science, and Build Back Better,\u201d are allowed. Some states are stricter. Montana doesn\u2019t allow anything \u201cthat is designed or tends to aid or promote the success or defeat of any candidate or ballot issue to be voted upon at the election.\u201d Some states don't allow candidate names but do allow slogans on apparel at polling places.

Since 2012, Arizona residents have been able to wear any kind of political garb they want after state lawmakers passed a bill that did not include clothing in its \u201celectioneering\u201d definition, AZCentral.com reported. The\u00a0law came after a tea party supporter won a lawsuit, letting her wear a T-shirt with a tea party logo to her polling place. In Minnesota, a similar case brought by another tea party supporter ended up going to the Supreme Court. In 2018, the court delivered a 7-2 decision to strike down a state law banning political clothing at polls, with the majority of justices finding that the state\u2019s rules were too vague.

Loeffler, a\u00a0co-owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, saw\u00a0players from the Atlanta team wear t-shirts\u00a0that read \"Vote Warnock\" in support of her Democratic opponent, Rev.\u00a0Raphael Warnock, after the Republican senator spoke out against the league's social justice plans.",

            "article_content": "Fox News political analyst Juan Williams recaps night one of the Democrat National Convention. Black Lives Matter has been the cultural and political story of the summer, at times managing to outstrip a pandemic and a presidential election for headlines as the movement led protests over racial injustice and animated\u00a0the Democratic\u00a0base\u00a0-- yet high-profile BLM leaders are conspicuously absent so far from this week's national convention, underscoring the tension between the far-left political movement and the party. The influence of Black Lives Matter on the Democratic convention, however, is apparent. Its platform in two separate spots says \"we believe Black lives matter.\"\u00a0Michelle Obama said \"Black life matters\" in her address (Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who spoke before her Monday, did not). WHAT TO WATCH FOR TUESDAY AT THE DNC: 'RISING STARS,' A FORMER PRESIDENT AND AOC'S ONE MINUTE And the brother of George Floyd, whose death in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department in late May served as the flashpoint that triggered nationwide unrest and the resurgence in the Black Lives Matter movement, asked for a moment of silence for his brother during his convention appearance. The tension between Black Lives Matter and the Democratic Party has been clear all summer, with many activists associated with the movement demanding absolute ideological purity from officials on causes like defunding police, and Democrats, at times, not willing to oblige. No moment Monday underscored that dynamic more than when presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden said police officers are generally good during a pre-recorded discussion on racial inequality. The official Black Lives Matter Twitter account liked this tweet criticizing Joe Biden's comment that most police officers are good. (Screenshot/Twitter) \"Most cops are good, but the fact is the bad ones have to be identified and prosecuted and out period,\" Biden said. That line\u00a0upset\u00a0many\u00a0progressive\u00a0activists, who said it missed the point they have been making -- that police, whether they as individuals have used unjustified force against Black people or are at their heart racists, are participating in the systemic oppression of Black people by simply being police officers. The A.C.A.B (All cops are bastards) acronym often seen at Black Lives Matter protests, Independent\u00a0writer Victoria Gagliardo-Silver said earlier this year, \"means every single police officer is complicit in a system that actively devalues the lives of people of color.\" \"Protestors haven\u2019t been in the streets all summer because \u2018most cops are good,'\" activist Brittney Cooper wrote on Twitter Monday.\u00a0\"Do better, Dems.\" The official Black Lives Matter Twitter account liked that tweet. TRUMP HITS BACK AT MICHELLE OBAMA AFTER SEARING DNC SPEECH, SAYS HE 'WOULD NOT BE HERE' IF NOT FOR HER HUSBAND Cooper's other tweets from Monday night and Tuesday morning, however, were largely complimentary of the convention itself and urged people to vote for Biden, perhaps reflecting most progressives' desire to oust President Trump. There are a handful\u00a0of elected officials, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., scheduled to speak for one minute on Tuesday, who have vocally supported the movement. But the lineup that's been made public so far is heavy on current and former officials -- not unusual for a political party's convention -- who have not actively participated in the movement. None of the official speakers up Monday, or publicly scheduled to appear at the DNC Tuesday through Thursday, are leaders within the Black Lives Matter movement. Fox News reached out to the DNC, the Biden campaign\u00a0and Black Lives Matter to inquire whether any yet-to-be-announced speakers at the Democratic convention would be Black Lives Matter leaders or high-profile activists, but none immediately responded. Even the speakers the DNC is featuring to highlight the message that Black lives matter, like Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, who spoke from Black Lives Matter Plaza, have been controversial within the Black Lives Matter movement. Bowser has been at odds with her city council over moves to defund the city's police, and said she doesn't think the city should have \"a mob decide\" to pull down historical statues. Bowser has even seen\u00a0protesters march\u00a0on her private property this summer\u00a0expressing dissatisfaction with her handling of the recent unrest and reluctance to give in to their demands. In another clash between a Democratic mayor and Black Lives Matter protesters this summer, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was booed out of a protest after refusing to commit to dismantling his city's police department. \"I do not support the full abolition of the Minneapolis Police Department,\" Frey said in response to a yes or no question on the matter. \"Alright, then get the f--- out of here,\" a protest leader yelled at him. \"Go.\" Similar hostilities have existed between Democratic Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and the city's Black former police chief, Carmen Best, who retired amid tension between her and the city government over support for police. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And if the tension between the Democratic Party establishment and Black Lives Matter was in question, Black Lives Matter DC eliminated any uncertainty\u00a0with broadsides against Bowser both Monday night and Tuesday morning. \"@MayorBowser is attempting to call out Trump\u2019s treatment of protestors to distract from hers,\" the group said Monday night. \"@MayorBowser Hyprocrite morning to you!You literally gave your speech where u had DEFUND MPD paved over,\" Black Lives Matter DC said Tuesday morning. \"41 Innocent Protesters where just beat, peppered sprayed & arrested last week.All Charges DROPPED. You or Paint don\u2019t keep us safe.\" Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.",

A new report on the suspension of New Yorker staff writer and CNN legal analyst\u00a0Jeffrey Toobin\u00a0claims the legal pundit was masturbating during a Zoom call with colleagues. Vice reported\u00a0on Monday that the magazine is investigating an incident where the legal pundit exposed himself to\u00a0members of the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0and WNYC radio staffs during a Zoom call last week. \"Jeffrey Toobin has been suspended while we investigate the matter,\u201d a spokesperson for the New Yorker confirmed to Fox News.

CNN ANALYST JEFFREY TOOBIN SUSPENDED BY NEW YORKER OVER ALLEDGED NUDITY ON ZOOM CALL The call, which was described as an \"election simulation,\" featured Toobin's New Yorker colleagues including Jane Mayer, Masha Gessen,\u00a0Andrew Marantz,\u00a0Jelani Cobb,\u00a0Evan Osnos,\u00a0Sue Halpern, and Dexter Filkins playing various roles in potential 2020 outcomes including President Trump, Joe Biden, \"establishment Republicans,\" 'establishment Democrats,\" and \"the military.\" Toobin was playing \"the courts.\" According to two sources, Toobin was seen masturbating in what was supposed to be a 10-minute \"strategy session\" along party lines, but that it \"seemed like Toobin was on a second video call.\" \"The sources said that when the groups returned from their breakout rooms, Toobin lowered the camera. The people on the call said they could see Toobin touching his penis. Toobin then left the call. Moments later, he called back in, seemingly unaware of what his colleagues had been able to see, and the simulation continued,\" Vice reported. Vice added an update to its original report, \"This piece has been updated with more detail about the call and the headline has been updated to reflect that Toobin was masturbating.\" In an email to staff according to Vice, New Yorker\u00a0editor David Remnick wrote,\u00a0\u201cDear All, As you may have read in various news reports today, one of our writers, Jeff Toobin, was suspended after an incident on a Zoom call last week. Please be assured that we take such matters seriously and that we are looking into it.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cI made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera. I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers,\" Toobin said in a statement to\u00a0Motherboard. \u201cI believed I was not visible on Zoom. I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video.\" According to a CNN statement obtained by\u00a0The Washington Post, \"Jeff Toobin has asked for some time off while he deals with a personal issue, which we have granted.\u201d CNN nor WNYC did not previously respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

            "article_content": "New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea joins 'Fox &amp; Friends' after another night of violence in the city in response to George Floyd's death. American cities are spending Monday morning digging out from\u00a0scenes of destruction after demonstrations against the\u00a0police-involved death\u00a0of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0gave way to\u00a0a fifth straight\u00a0night\u00a0of looting\u00a0and rioting,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0another wave of arrests. As of Monday morning, at least 4,400 people have been taken into custody\u00a0nationwide\u00a0in relation to the chaos, according to an Associated Press\u00a0tally. Meanwhile,\u00a0countless more business owners\u00a0whose livelihoods already have been impacted by the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic\u00a0are\u00a0finding\u00a0their stores damaged\u00a0and ransacked. \u201cIt's one of the most challenging times that I\u2019ve seen in my 30 years of policing,\u201d NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told \"Fox & Friends\"\u00a0on\u00a0Monday\u00a0after a night of looting in Manhattan\u2019s Soho neighborhood left sidewalks outside high-end retail stores littered with debris and broken glass.\u00a0\u201cI can tell you that we had thousands of police officers deployed last night.\u201d People run out of a broken-into smoke shop in New York City early Monday as police arrive. (AP) FOX NEWS CREW REPORTS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SEEN STEALING FROM STORES IN NEW YORK CITY \u201cIn terms of protest, in terms of balancing orderly protest, respecting people\u2019s rights to peacefully assemble, that was going on all day, large crowds in Brooklyn, smaller crowds in Queens, significant crowds in Manhattan,\" Dermot continued. \u201cBut then it turned dark, it turned ugly and it turned that way fast.\u201d The\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reports that police arrested dozens of looters in the Big Apple overnight. A witness told the newspaper that some of them acted in an apparent system where\u00a0suspects would break into stores before leaping into getaway vehicles outside. Videos\u00a0on social media\u00a0showed crowds\u00a0targeting\u00a0a wide array of\u00a0businesses\u00a0throughout Manhattan,\u00a0emerging from shattered storefronts with everything\u00a0ranging from Chanel\u00a0handbags to bicycles. The ongoing demonstrations that have gripped the U.S. and the\u00a0entire world\u00a0were sparked by the death of Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as\u00a0a\u00a0Minneapolis officer\u00a0pressed a knee into his neck.\u00a0That officer \u2013\u00a0Derek Chauvin\u00a0\u2013 has been charged with third-degree murder and\u00a0reportedly has been transferred\u00a0to a maximum-security prison. Dr. Marc Siegel says he's very concerned about the spread of COVID-19 amid the nationwide protests. Floyd's death came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger\u00a0Ahmaud Arbery\u00a0in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of\u00a0Breonna Taylor\u00a0in her home in March. HISTORIC MINNEAPOLIS RESTAURANT BURNED DOWN BY RIOTERS JUST DAYS BEFORE REOPENING Despite\u00a0fresh\u00a0concerns about the spread of coronavirus, Americans\u00a0from all walks of life\u00a0have come together en masse\u00a0to demonstrate\u00a0against\u00a0the deaths\u00a0and call for the reform of police departments and the criminal justice system. While many of the\u00a0gatherings have been peaceful\u00a0\u2013 including some that\u00a0saw officers take a knee in solidarity with protesters\u00a0\u2013 others have\u00a0frequently\u00a0turned violent,\u00a0often\u00a0when\u00a0late\u00a0afternoon gives way to nightfall. A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston made a turn for a worse overnight when protesters clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores, and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Jacqui Heinrich reports from the scene after a day of violence in the city. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday, adding that seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. RANDOM PILES OF BRICKS REPORTED AT GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS In Portland, Oregon, police deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Demonstrators near the White House in Washington, D.C. protest the death of George Floyd on Sunday. (AP) A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque also turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers said\u00a0they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos told the\u00a0Associated\u00a0Press that officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores \u2013 although there were no reports of injuries. GEORGE FLOYD UNREST: RIOTS, FIRES, VIOLENCE ESCALATE IN SEVERAL MAJOR CITIES And in Texas, police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Some people \u2013 in television footage of the standoff -- could be seen throwing water bottles at police. A little farther north in Dallas\u00a0\u2013 one of the many\u00a0U.S. cities to have\u00a0instituted a curfew\u00a0in hopes of quelling the unrest \u2013 police made dozens of arrests. People clean up items outside a Jewel grocery store Monday in Chicago, after the business was broken into during unrest in reaction to the death of George Floyd. (AP) Some Americans have even tried to get in the way of the looters, with mixed results. A man protecting a liquor store in Chicago Sunday night was hit in the right arm by gunfire and was rushed to a hospital, where he is now said to be in good condition, according to the\u00a0Chicago Sun-Times. FAMED WASHINGTON, D.C. MONUMENTS DEFACED AFTER NIGHT OF PROTESTS In Philadelphia,\u00a0local residents\u00a0from a group called \u201cStand Up Philly\u201d banded together to deter looters from going after\u00a0a Target store. Anthony, one of its members, told Fox29 that the locals are against what happened to Floyd, calling it \u201cdisgusting\u201d and vowing that \u201cit has to stop.\u201d \u201cBut we\u00a0have to\u00a0unite the city and what is happening throughout the city right now is dividing the city,\u00a0it is not uniting the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no justice in robbing stores and looting your own neighborhood and burning the city down.\u201d Mayor Francis Suarez says the majority of people arrested in the George Floyd protests are not from Miami. Even though an\u00a0estimated 16,000 National Guard troops\u00a0have been mobilized to quell the rioting and looting, it\u2019s not clear when the violence will end. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But in the meantime, Shea is calling on all Americans\u00a0to show restraint. \u201cI think people need to understand, when they see officers out there on the line as they\u2019re doing now trying to keep peace, they\u2019re doing the best they can in an extremely,\u00a0extremely difficult situation,\u201d he told \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019. \u201cThis goes across the country and they need your\u00a0support.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump should remind voters that he is the protector and guarantor of our constitutional frameworks, says the Hoover Institute's Victor Davis Hanson. This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" July 30, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening, and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" After two months of rioting and political chaos, there are still people out there who claim this is all about the death of George Floyd. Believe it or not, there are. Some of the people who say that may actually believe and we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. The liberal mom who lives next door to you, for example. She is probably entirely sincere when she lectures you about the scourge of police brutality, she means it. She has no idea BLM is about anything else. We're not judging, and that's not surprising. Most Americans are nice people. They're literal and ingenuous. They tend to take claims at face value because they want to believe the best. But in this case, they are wrong. None of what you are watching is about Civil Rights. Violence and race baiting are the enemies of Civil Rights. What you're watching instead is a power grab. It's being coordinated by the most ruthless and cynical figures in American politics. They don't want you to know what they're doing. They're not honorable enough to state their intentions. They're not like you at all. When normal people want something, they can be aggressive. But the professional left never is. It's invariably passive aggressive. Their first instinct is to manipulate rather than persuade, they hide their real beliefs. They say precisely the opposite of what they mean every time. They accuse you of the crimes they themselves are committing. It makes your head spin. Arguing with them is pointless, by the way, they're nihilists. They don't believe in the existence of truth or in the fixed meaning of words. They care only about power. It's painful to say this. It hurts to admit there are people in our country who are like this, but there are and they have more power than ever. If you need more evidence of that, Barack Obama showed up at Congressman John Lewis' funeral today. Obama claimed he was there to eulogize his own friend, but that's not true, and that's not what he did. Instead, Obama gave a divisive and deeply dishonest campaign speech in church. Here's part of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: By ending some of the partisan gerrymandering so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians, not the other way around. And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God given rights of every American, then that's what we should do. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: It's hard to believe that clip is real, but it is, down to the cloying fake accent, Mr. Hawaii guy. But take three steps back, imagine if some greasy politician showed up at your loved one's funeral and started throwing around stupid partisan talking points about Senate procedure, can you imagine that? You'd be shocked if that happened. You'd probably walk out. Desecrating a funeral with campaign slogans? What kind of person would do that? But Democrats in the audience didn't seem offended. They didn't blink, they cheered. It all seemed normal to them, and why wouldn't it? Political power is their religion. It's not out of place in a church. It's what they worship. People who will politicize a funeral will do anything, and they're trying to. Democrats are working systematically to dismantle the core institutions of American life, beginning with the family and with faith. They're subverting the core system in our government, the justice system. They're nullifying laws, burning police stations, attacking courthouses, working to eliminate the legal equality of American citizens, the foundation of it all. They've systematically repurposed Federal law enforcement agencies as political weapons. They have imprisoned their political opponents. Their leaders have called for making all of these changes permanent by packing the Supreme Court, packing the United States Senate, packing the electorate itself by importing tens of millions of new voters. Why are they doing all of this? They'll tell you, it's to make the country better and more just, but the country isn't improving and it's not fairer. They're doing this for one reason: to ensure they have complete control of the United States. We're watching it happen right now, though almost no one ever admits it and those who do come close to getting shut down. We can tell you stories. So how should the rest of us respond to what we're seeing? And let's be clear, by the rest of us we're not just talking about conservatives or people who watch the show. We're talking about literally, everybody else -- moderates, the politically non-aligned, traditional liberals who still care about civil liberties; there are some of those, sincere religious people of all faiths, immigrants from abroad who came to this country because of our Bill of Rights, only to watch it evaporate once they got here. In other words, everyone who fundamentally loves this country, which is still most Americans. What are people like that do in the face of this? This revolution? Well, it's simple. Defend the system that we have. That's our job. The American system is flawed. No one doubts that, but it works better than any other system in history and tearing it down will not help. In fact, it will benefit only a few of the ones pushing for it, and it will crush millions. So if you care about the United States, fight for its institutions. They have served us well. This country has survived almost 250 years through a Civil War. Let's keep going. The president this morning vented his frustrations on Twitter about potential voter fraud in the upcoming election. He wrote this quote, \"With universal mail-in voting, not absentee voting, which is good, 2020 will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the United States.\" We don't know if that's true. We hope it's not, it could be, though. That's what the President wrote. And then he ended this way, quote, \"Delay the election until people can properly, securely and safely vote.\" End quote. Delay the election, and that was the headline across cable news today and we should be clear that will not happen. The election will almost certainly take place in November. But at this point, it's probably unwise to suggest changing the election. Voter fraud or not. Too much is in flux already. That's not accidental. It's by design. A bewildered population, dealing with change from every possible direction cannot fight back. That's why they're doing it. So our job is to defend what we already have as a nation and to promote the continuation of it. Keeping things the same has never been more important than it is right now. Victor Davis Hanson has thought a lot about all of these topics and we're honored to have him as we always are tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you for having me. CARLSON: If you are able to clear your head long enough to get the overview here, every -- by my count, every significant institution in American life is under sustained assault from the left. What's the point of that, do you think? HANSON: I think the point is they don't have confidence in their message that will resonate with 51 percent of the population, at least, they seem that way so they want to change the system rather than work within the system that won't yield the result that they demand. And I think Donald Trump is frustrated, but I think you're quite right, Tucker. He is the enforcer of traditions and protocols that have gone back to the 19th Century. We always have the first Tuesday after the first of November, and that's what we did. We did it in the Civil War. We did it in World War I. We did it in World War II. He has been the victim of weaponization of the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the D.O.J., the distortion of the 25th Amendment. He has been a victim of trying to erode the institution of impeachment, to politicize it in a way we hadn't seen before. So he has to strike back and say, I'm not going to pack the court. I'm not going to destroy the Electoral College. That's what you want to do. You want to let 16 year olds vote, you want to let felons vote. But in this next 90 days, I'm going to get task forces to make sure the Postal Service is swift, efficient, and with balloting. I'm going to get more polling stations available so we can social distance. We're going to accommodate these crisis of virus, lockdown, rioting, recession. We can do it and that's -- and he doesn't need to do it. That's what's ironic because there's about seven or eight known unknowns tougher from now until Election Day. We don't know the waxing and waning of the virus. We don't know whether the lockdown will be porous. We don't know the status of the economy. We don't know the effect of all of this lawless anarchy and chaos on the so-called silent voter. We don't know what John Durham is going to do. We don't know what the Vice President selection of Joe Biden will portend. We don't know what Joe Biden will do if he actually has to go out and perform like a regular candidate. I have a sneaking suspicion that those are tailwinds for Donald Trump. That he doesn't need to alter the system because that's the natural role for the Republican Party in general and for him in particular. He has been a victim of people who try to distort these constitutional frameworks and he has got to remind everybody that he is the protector and the guarantor of them. CARLSON: He is the protector and the guarantor of our system. That is exactly right and so nicely put. Not surprisingly. Victor Davis Hanson, thank you for that summary. Great to see you. HANSON: Thank you. CARLSON: Rioters, domestic terrorists have been waging a sustained war on the City of Portland, Oregon for more than two months now. For some reason, the U.S. government has allowed this to continue even as rioters have damaged Federal property and attacked police officers. Last weekend, one of them stabbed a journalist. We have footage of it, here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Someone is stalking us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, buddy. Why are you following us? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Aw. Aw. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you just stab him? Bro, he just stabbed him, dude. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: He did just stab him and the man who was stabbed survived. He joins us tonight, the journalist Andrew Duncomb. We welcome him. Andrew, thanks so much for coming on. ANDREW DUNCOMB, JOURNALIST WHO WAS STABBED IN PORTLAND: Thank you, Tucker for having me. CARLSON: So the factual questions first, why were you stabbed? Who did it? And has that person been arrested? DUNCOMB: Yes, I was stabbed by a known Antifa member by the name of Blake Hampe. I was -- I feel like I was -- I feel like I was stabbed and/or targeted specifically due to my location being doxed, about me being here inside of Portland 17 hours before I had arrived. CARLSON: Has the man who stabbed you been arrested? Is he in jail right now? DUNCOMB: Yes, he's been arrested. He is charged with second degree felony assault, currently being held on a $250,000.00 bail. CARLSON: He just missed your spinal cord. By the way, congratulations on surviving. This stabbing has received very little news coverage. I assume because you're not a leftist. Had you seen this guy before? Did you expect it? Why do you think he did it? DUNCOMB: I've never seen him before. Once again, I had been -- I had been stalked and doxed previously on Twitter, by these people here, the Rose City Antifa Group, where they would put my information out there saying like he'll be here, he will be here. Previously in the past -- I've been targeted by Antifa previously in the past, and so for me to say specifically what the intent was, I'm not sure. CARLSON: Right. Well, you're obviously a black man who disagrees with their views. So that must be deeply offensive to them. What happened after you were -- DUNCOMB: The targeting definitely has to do with me being a black Trump supporter. And anytime that I come to film, they know that it destroys their narrative and it goes against what they're trying to promote. CARLSON: Yes, I mean, there -- I guess there's one revolutionary who doesn't think Black Lives Matter, I guess. So what happened after you were stabbed? What did they -- did they say anything to you? Did he say anything when he stabbed you? And what did the people around him say when you fell down with a knife wound? DUNCOMB: When I fell down, I didn't -- I can't remember specifically there -- I was on a -- it was kind of a traumatic experience. I can't remember if he said anything specifically to me. Once I got stabbed, my body kind of went into shock and kind of in a fight mode. And so I remember getting up after I hit the ground from falling and looking at him specifically. And I saw the knife that he had in his hands and it looked like -- it appeared to be about seven inches. And so I just remember thinking I had to keep pressure on my wound and try to get somewhere safe. One of my guys that I was with stepped in between us and he told the guy that I was with, do you want to get shanked next to? CARLSON: It's just -- it's just beyond belief that this is America. Did the governor of the state, the mayor of the city, city councilman, any of them -- the ones who have encouraged this kind of violence, did any of them reach out to you after you've been stabbed? DUNCOMB: No, sir. Not at all. I haven't heard anything from any of them. The only ones that has reached out to me is some local reporters and things like that trying to -- they wanted to get this story out. CARLSON: What do you conclude from this, Andrew? What have you learned? DUNCOMB: I've learned -- basically, it's really not so much -- I've learned like with this incident, like I see it as a miracle to be here right now, to be able to even do this interview right now. It was -- the knife went in about four to five inches inside of my side and ended up missing everything. Remarkably, I didn't require surgery, just a little bit of blood and pain. And so, more so, I want to turn this into a message to tell everybody that they need to wake up and people need to start exposing Antifa for who they truly are and that is a domestic terrorist organization who are actively deploying an assault against our democracy. And they don't really care about black lives. They are using BLM as a front to carry out the senseless acts of assault against this country. CARLSON: Yes, the leadership should be charged with criminal conspiracy and would be in prison right now, and they haven't been for reasons that aren't clear. I'm glad you survived. Andrew, thank you. Thank you for coming on tonight. DUNCOMB: Thank you, Tucker for having me. CARLSON: Thank you. Well, for centuries, former American Presidents have followed a tradition of maintaining a dignified silence once they leave office. Barack Obama doesn't bother with those rules. He used Congressman John Lewis' funeral today to give a nasty partisan political speech. The press didn't report that. But we have tape. Plus, it's been two months since George Floyd died in Minneapolis. Has Minneapolis become a safer, happier, more just city? A report from Minneapolis after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: As of this week, it's been two months since George Floyd died, and in that short period of time, this country has changed perhaps more than it has in decades. There has been widespread violence and lawlessness. We just talked to a man who was stabbed for the crime of trying to cover a riot. Crime rates have soared in almost every major city. Here's how people in Minneapolis responded to George Floyd's death. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] CARLSON: So things fell completely apart. In case you don't remember that from a couple of months ago, a small group of violent people took control, but the most amazing part of all of this is how the City of Minneapolis responded, the City Council. Rather than increasing the presence of the police, decided to eliminate the police department, and then that idea which two weeks before would have been considered so insane, no one would have said it out loud, metastasized almost immediately to the rest of the Democratic Party and defund the police became a talking point. Now, Barack Obama, one of the sleaziest and most dishonest figures in the history of American politics used George Floyd's death at a funeral to attack the police. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Bull Connor may be gone, buy today, we witness with our own eyes, police officers kneeling on the necks of black Americans. Bull Connor? The country falling apart riven by racial strife and tribalism, and one of the most respected people in the whole country decides to pour gasoline on that and compare the police to Bull Connor? As if America or Minneapolis is like Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. It's insane. It's reckless. But of course Obama doesn't care. It's only about November and the coming election. The problem is, what they're doing to get there. What happens when you eliminate the police or diminish their power? Here's what happens. (END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): Following riots and public demonstrations against the Minneapolis Police, the city is now seeing a surge in crime. Homicides have doubled this year. Gun crimes dramatically outpaced last year. People who live in work where the riots hit say prostitution, drugs and burglary are now unabated. With a segment of the public and the City Council against them, the Police Union says morale is terrible. Officers don't proactively police and are reluctant to use force. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Oh, so when you eliminate the police, there's more crime surprised precisely no one including the people who did it. Members of the Minneapolis City Council knew exactly what the result would be. They're not that stupid. So even as they abolish the police, they forced taxpayers to pay for security for their homes. Oh, I get it. Fox News senior correspondent, Rick Leventhal has been in and around Minneapolis really for months now. He joins us with report. Hey, Rick. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. As we all watched, Minneapolis became the launch pad for nationwide protests two months ago after the death of George Floyd and those demonstrations turned ugly fast, and the destruction that you've documented was widespread. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] LEVENTHAL: Apartment buildings, restaurants and other businesses were set on fire and looted some in broad daylight. Vehicles were smashed and torched, including police cars and a Postal truck to the delight of the crowds, but no one is cheering now, Tucker. Parts of the city have been deserted. Much has not been repaired. Crime is up and business is down. Homeless camps filling city parks are just now being dismantled. A salon owner told \"Fox and Friends\" about the loss of her shop that she has had for 40 years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just could not believe it. Everything was just up in up -- up in just a big fire -- just a big ball of fire. Smoke and fire and I couldn't believe it. It hurts to know I have no business. I have nothing at all. I don't even have a styling chair anymore, you know. I don't have a salon anymore, so it hurts. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: And Tucker, as you mentioned, in the aftermath of the riots, the City Council voted to defund the police, drawing criticism from a group of anti-violence black activists who held a press conference earlier this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is time for us to stand up in this city. It is time to tell the City Council that utopia is a bunch of BS. We are not in Mayberry RFD. We are in the Wild, Wild West. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: The city needs help, Tucker, and many are wondering when it's coming. CARLSON: I like how she put it. Thanks so much, Rick. Good to see you tonight. Thank you. LEVENTHAL: You, too. CARLSON: Pastor Steve Carlisle has been in Minneapolis for a long time for decades. He's seen the city evolve, including recently and we're happy to have him with us tonight. Pastor, thanks so much for coming on. So, it's been about two months. Tell us, because you have perspective how you think Minneapolis has changed in that time? PASTOR STEVE CARLISLE, VINE CHURCH MINNEAPOLIS: Well, there's less of a cop presence, which means that crime is on the up and up. And you know, it's sad. It's sad to see -- well, first, I'll say Minneapolis is a beautiful place. If you've been here, it's a beautiful place. CARLSON: Yes, it is. CARLISLE: And it's really sad to see people move out. It's sad to see people live in fear. I personally have -- I have seven kids and a wife and, and it gets tense at times. I mean, there's no sirens and there's no cop presence. You know, there's no cops pulling up and, you know, want to get to know -- you know, talk with us. And so that's a little bit disheartening, I would say. CARLSON: So, the irony is this violence, these riots were committed in the name of the weakest in Minneapolis. We're helping the little guy, the underdog, they told us. It sounds by the description you just gave that people without a lot of money and say seven children haven't been helped by this at all. CARLISLE: Well, again, this is what I know because I know that we need a greater cop presence. There's incidents -- I just happen to live about six blocks from the Third Precinct, six blocks away from where the target was burned down and all of that. And I can tell you speaking from where I live, we just -- people, it would seem -- it would seem like the Wild, Wild West. I mean, people are just bowled into -- fire guns and just break into places and this or that, and it's just -- it becomes scary. It becomes scary. CARLSON: Are you going to stay? CARLISLE: Well, I'm going to stay. I'm going to stay. You know, I was born and raised here. I'm a pastor at the church next door. And we're pointing people -- we're pointing people to Christ and pointing people to the hope that we have in Christ. So hey, Tucker, I am going to stay. CARLSON: You're a brave man. Pastor, thank you for joining us with that update. I appreciate it. Good luck. CARLISLE: Yes. Thank you. CARLSON: So Dr. Anthony Fauci has commanded you to wear a mask. He has commanded you to stay inside. Now, he wants you to do something else. Something extra. It's not Halloween. It's public health. We will tell you what Dr. Fauci has asked you to do, next. Plus the tech companies censored a video about the coronavirus they didn't like because they thought it might hurt Joe Biden's chances in the election. One of the physicians in that video lost her job. She's here straight ahead to tell us what happened. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: You have mucosa in the nose, mucosa in the mouth, but you also have mucosa in the eye. And that's one of the things that you know, theoretically you should protect all the mucosal surfaces. So, if you have goggles, or an eye shield, you should use it. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Anthony Fauci is 79 years old, he probably never thought that he would have to wait this long to accumulate as much power as he now has. But he's wasted no time in using it. Fauci has told you to do a lot of things over the last several months, wear a mask, stay inside, not go to work. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Restaurants, small businesses closed forever. He has transformed the American way of life in just a matter of months, but he's not done. Anthony Fauci has new plans for you. Now, Dr. Fauci says he would like you to wear goggles when you go out in public. Yes, that's not based in science actually. We checked. Most major studies on the transmission of the coronavirus through the eyes have been inconclusive. We're not sure and it doesn't look like a major vector for the spread of the disease. But that doesn't matter to Anthony Fauci. Shut up and put your goggles on, is his position. Unless of course, you're in the opening (AUDIO GAP). (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're swiping on a dating app, like Tinder or Bumble or Grindr, and you match with someone and you just kind of like, maybe it's fine if this one stranger comes over, what do you say to that person? FAUCI: You know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks. And that depends on the level of the interaction that you want to have. If you're looking for friends sitting in a room, put a mask on, and you know, chat a bit. If you want to go a little bit more intimate, well, then that's your choice regarding your risk. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Oh, so it's totally your choice. You have to stay inside, not go to work, wear a mask. But you can find a stranger on a dating app, Bumble or Tinder and have sex with that person and that's not a risk. That's your choice. Oh, okay. But just remember, when you go outside, you must wear a mask. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAUCI: But some sort of mask-like facial covering, I think for the time being should be a very regular part of how we prevent the spread of infection. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Okay, I hope you're following along. Fauci has never been elected to anything, but his word is law, and if you criticize him, you're in trouble. So ignore what we're about to show you. It's a picture of Anthony Fauci sitting in a baseball game within six feet of other people without wearing the mask. And by the way, you'll notice no goggles. Hmm. Fauci also, by the way, wants to end the handshake. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) FAUCI: I don't think we ever should ever shake hands ever again, to be honest with you, not only would it be good to prevent coronavirus disease, it probably would decrease the incidence of influenza dramatically in this country. (END AUDIO CLIP) CARLSON: So people have been shaking hands with one another through all known human history since at least the Greeks, but that's no longer allowed, unless you're Anthony Fauci or you're having sex with strangers you meet on Tinder. Hmm. And now we have to wear goggles. Whoa, how long before mandatory spacesuits or 12-foot hula hoops to ensure proper social distancing? Okay, we'll keep you posted on the goggle question. Dr. Anthony Fauci. Well, America's tech oligarchs as we reported the other night censored a video of physicians expressing their views about treatment for the coronavirus. Some of those views were optimistic that would hurt the Joe Biden for president campaign. And so they pulled it off the internet and banned anyone from sharing it. That's the state of free speech in America. We're allowed to share it here because we don't work for Google or Facebook. So here's a clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SIMONE GOLD, BOARD CERTIFIED EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: This is a treatment regimen that's very simple, and it should be in the hands of the American people. The difficult aspect of this is that at the moment because of politics, it's being blocked from doctors prescribing it, and it's being blocked from pharmacists releasing it. They've been empowered to overrule the doctor's opinion. I'm in favor of it being over the counter. Give it to the people. Give it to the people. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Dr. Simone Gold was in that video, the banned one. She was censored, but more than that, she was fired from her job, apparently, for appearing in that video. We're going to get the story directly from her because she joins us now. Doctor, thanks so much for coming on. Can it be true that you lost your job for expressing your medical opinions on camera? GOLD: Yes, thank you so much. I'm a board-certified emergency physician for 20 years. In fact, until it seems like five minutes ago, I was considered a hero and people would be clapping and glad that I was doing what I was doing. And then the video came out and I was summarily fired for appearing in what was told to me is an embarrassing video. So that's what happened. CARLSON: Leaving aside the legal question of whether an employer is just allowed to fire someone for appearing in a video that might hurt the Biden campaign, I'm interested in what their justification was. You're a doctor treating patients in an emergency room. What does a video have to do with your work? GOLD: Yes, of course, it has nothing to do with my work. I'm very well liked, well regarded. Thankfully, I've got a wonderful reputation with the patients, with my staff, with my colleagues and actually, I enjoy what I do. But you know, we came to Washington because we're so distressed. You know, frontline doctors like myself, we're seeing patients not get what they need. We're seeing the doctor-patient relationship being completely eroded that the governors are empowering pharmacies to overrule doctors who had conversations with their patients. It's really something that Americans should be alarmed about. And as you probably know, I did not know things were going to go viral. Of course, I was told later that we were the most viral video of all time. Apparently, there was 18 million views on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, wherever it is, and they all kind of summarily pulled all of it. It was just all taken off. My own website was taken down, and it's been interesting ever since. CARLSON: And we should say for our viewers who haven't seen it, and presumably our viewers can't see it because the tech companies have censored it, but it wasn't an hour-long video on hydroxychloroquine. There are many parts to it, including what you just said that were interesting that were clearly true. Shouldn't you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored? GOLD: You know, what's funny is the video that got the most attention was a press conference we did right in front of the Supreme Court, but actually the Summit was seven hours of doctors teaching the American people. We decided to come straight to the American people with lots of social media, so we did a morning session for three and a half hours and an afternoon session for three and a half hours. I'm not sure you even knew that and we went through everything with the lockdown, masks, hydroxychloroquine treatment, other treatments, just all of it. How it affects older people, younger people, et cetera. That was actually the majority of the Summit. And yes, people will be able to find it on -- I had to rebuild my website really quickly, America's Frontline Doctors. They took my URL, so it's got the word Summit now, americasfrontlinedoctorssummit.com. I don't want anyone to just believe me, because I'm saying it. We put together a white paper that has all the scientists utterly irrefutable that hydroxychloroquine is safe. That's without question. And there's tons and tons of studies to show now that it is quite efficacious. You have to kind of wonder why we're still talking about an F.D.A. approved medication. It has been around for 65 years. It's been around since long before George Washington who gave it to his troops. Why are we still discussing it? It's a little bit strange. CARLSON: Yes, I mean, look, I majored in Russian History. I don't know anything about hydroxychloroquine. I do know about the way the country is supposed to work and physicians should be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you're not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that's scary and I'm grateful that you came on tonight, Doctor. I really am. GOLD: Let me say one thing. There's a lot of people -- there's a lot of people saying some negative things about me. I would ask people please to stop saying negative things about me. I'm a board certified emergency physician. I take good care of patients. We've hired Lynn Wood to help me in this matter. And I hope that that puts to rest anything that people might want to say that's defamatory. CARLSON: I hope so, too. I rarely root for lawyers, but I am in this case. Dr. Gold, thank you. Appreciate it. GOLD: Thank you. CARLSON: So as you know, if you watch the show, repeatedly over the years, we have attacked robots. Automating everything has downsides. And by the way, robots are creepy. Well, apparently a moment ago, the robots at the center of our camera, fought back and messed with the picture. You probably couldn't see the show for a couple of minutes. We wanted to tell you why you couldn't because the robots took over -- just a little glimpse of our future, our amazing crew got it back and running. Just ahead, probably the best advantage a person can have in fighting the coronavirus according to some research is being married. Married couples are more likely to survive infection than unmarried. That's far from the only health benefit or benefit in general of marriage, but it's one. We're going to talk to someone who knows a lot about it, after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: There's been a lot of talk about public health since March when the Wuhan virus arrived here from China where they unleashed quite something on us. But the one public health imperative that Washington consistently overlooks in fact consistently undermines is marriage. Married men and women are nearly twice as likely to be satisfied with their lives, happy than those who are unmarried. They're also less likely to be infected with the virus or more likely to survive if they are infected. Here to explain the link between marriage and health is the Director of the National Marriage Project, Bradford Wilcox. Mr. Wilcox, thanks so much for coming on. So how is the state of marriage related to survival rates of coronavirus? BRADFORD WILCOX, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL MARRIAGE PROJECT: Tucker, what the evidence indicates is that counties that have more married people are less likely to be suffering from higher rates of infection from coronavirus. That's what we see, in terms of that particular angle. We also see when you look at married couples more generally, in the face of the kind of emotional traumas that I think all Americans are facing, we're seeing that married Americans, about 40 percent less likely to be depressed, to be anxious, to be worried. So there's kind of an emotional piece to it. They're kind of riding out this pandemic more successfully on the emotional front as well. CARLSON: Social scientists has pretty much, I would say, proven this over decades of research. So why does Washington either ignore it or actively seek to undermine marriage? WILCOX: Well, you know, I think there is this paradox that, you know, many elites today in America are actually living quite successful marriages. We've seen actually kind of divorce decline dramatically in the last 30 years or so particularly among college educated Americans, but they don't only kind of talk about marriage in public. I think they are kind of reluctant to address, you know, kind of family issues for really two reasons. One is that, you know, I think everyone knows people who have struggled in their marriages have gotten divorced, have had some kind of family difficulty, and they don't want to kind of sort of tackle that issue. The second though, I think piece to this is that there's kind of this progressive idea out there that sort of change of any sort is good and that family change of the last, you know, 50 years is, you know, by and large, you know, a good thing. So it's kind of a reluctance to sort of really think about whether or not these family changes we've seen in America over the last, you know, five decades have been good for our kids, and good for our communities. CARLSON: Yes, they're good at destroying, not so good at building. Bradford Wilcox, thank you so much. Great to see you. WILCOX: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: President Obama desecrated the funeral of Congressman John Lewis today to give a political speech. More on that after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Barack Obama showed up at a funeral today, John Lewis's funeral, to give a eulogy, but he didn't do that. Instead, he gave a grubby and dishonest political speech that went on and on, a vicious one, too. Here's Obama extolling the virtues of mail-in voting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Even as we sit here, there are those in power, who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run up to an election that's going to be dependent on mail- in ballots, so people don't get sick. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Yes, targeting minorities. That's a lie. That's a flat out lie. There's no evidence of that whatsoever and in the middle of racial turmoil, here's a former President stoking the fire for political reasons. It is disgusting. And actually mail-in voting, which is underway, has proven to be a disaster in a lot of places. In Washington, D.C. thousands of voters didn't receive their mail-in ballots at all, or until the day of the last election. In May, the Justice Department indicted a mailman for altering voters' ballot requests. Jen Ellis has fought all of this. She is a legal adviser to the Trump Reelect. She joins us tonight. So leaving aside the philosophical questions of mail-in voting, how is it actually working? Well? JENNA ELLIS, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR LEGAL ADVISER: Well, it's a disaster. It's absolutely a disaster, Tucker, and you don't need more studies. You don't need more debates about it to just look at what's going on in New York where even \"The Washington Post\" called it a total train wreck. President Trump highlighted that today where we don't even know the results of one district and the Democrats think that this is somehow 95 days before the presidential national election, we can implement universal vote by mail and we'll get the results on Election Day or even close to it. You look at Paterson, New Jersey where one out of every five ballots was discarded for being fraudulent. And there were reports of massive amounts of mail-in ballots that were just left in apartment buildings and didn't get to their residents. You look at what's going on in Pennsylvania. You look at the Democrats, who -- and their allies who are suing in dozens of states to try to have the election ballots to be counted days -- 10 days and days after Election Day. I mean, this is something where you're talking about the Democrats wanting to destroy the pillars of American society, the family and the church. It's also the civil society, the peaceful transition of power, the elections that are by the people, of the people and for the people. This is what started with the corrupt Obama administration, not allowing the peaceful transition of power to President Trump when he was still President-Elect. They tried to do this through the Russia hoax. They tried to do this with witch hunt impeachment and now, because they haven't successfully gotten rid of President Trump, they're trying to undermine our vote and the sanctity of our election and our franchise through universal vote by mail, which is a complete disaster. We're already seeing the results. And it's only the Democrats that want to remove election safeguards and they want to push out this universal vote by mail under the auspices of the coronavirus. If we can stand in line at a grocery store, at a hardware store, we can stand in line to vote. CARLSON: And they racialize everything -- everything. This has nothing to do with race. All Americans have the right to vote. No one is contesting that. No one is being targeted because of their skin color. This is insane and it makes people hate each other. It makes them suspicious. It causes them to abandon faith in the system. And there's a cost to that. ELLIS: Absolutely. CARLSON: Jenna Ellis, thank you so much. I appreciate it. ELLIS: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Not to get overwrought, but it's true, and there's so much of that going on, it's always the same storyline. Do what we want or we will impugn your character and make it impossible for you to live in this country. That's blackmail, honestly. We will be back tomorrow.

            "article_content": "NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea discusses how the movement to defund the police is impacting the city. Calls to \"defund the police\" are still alive on social media and in protests amid civil unrest across the U.S., but spikes in violent crime have some officials questioning the feasibility\u00a0of the movement. The phrase gained momentum after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor\u00a0involving police use of lethal force\u00a0as well as the officer-involved shooting of Jacob Blake, which sparked outrage across the country and calls to defund police departments. \"Maybe the ambitions of the 'defund the police movement' have scaled back somewhat,\" Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah, told Fox News. \"When the ideas were first being announced, they were being announced in very grandiose\u00a0terms, and the pushback has led to a very rapid reassessment and realignment of what the goals really were to much more modest proportions.\" \"Defund the Police\" is painted on the street in Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, June 14, 2020. (Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images) A number of activist and civil rights organizations ranging from the ACLU to Black Lives Matter to\u00a0March for Our Lives\u00a0has\u00a0called on officials to\u00a0\"divest\" or \"defund\" the police, arguing that reallocating\u00a0federal funding from police departments toward other local services could make communities safer, especially for minorities. Celebrities including Lizzo, John Legend, Natalie Portman and Jane Fonda signed an open letter calling to defund police. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced in June that he would cut $150 million from the city's police budget and redistribute some of the funds to \"black communities and communities of color,\" according to the LA Times. HOW CITYWIDE PROTESTS, SURGES IN VIOLENT CRIME COULD AFFECT THE 2020 ELECTION The New York City Council in July voted to slash $1 billion from the city's police funding and transfer that money to youth and community development programs. \"Defunding police means defunding police,\" Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a press release at the time. \"It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education\u2019s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.\" Others have called for the complete abolishment of police departments, including\u00a0Minneapolis City Council members, who announced a veto-proof plan in June to completely dismantle the city's police department and spoke to supporters at a June rally in Powderhorn Park. Alondra Cano, a city council member, speaks during \"The Path Forward\" meeting at Powderhorn Park on Sunday, June 7, 2020, in Minneapolis. The focus of the meeting was the defunding of the Minneapolis Police Department. (Jerry Holt/Star Tribune via AP) But recent spikes in violent crime in major U.S. cities have some officials questioning the effectiveness of the idea. Minneapolis City Council member\u00a0Jamal Osman said during a Sept. 16 meeting that residents were expressing concerns about crime upticks and asking where the police were. \u201cResidents are asking, \u2018Where are the police?\u2019\u201d Osman\u00a0said, adding that constituents' calls to the department\u00a0had\u00a0gone unanswered. \"That is the only public safety option they have at the moment. MPD. They rely on MPD. And they are saying they are nowhere to be seen.\u201d MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL'S 'HYPOCRISY' AMID CRIME UPTICK 'ASTOUNDING,' GOP CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE SAYS Minneapolis Police Chief\u00a0Medaria Arradondo said about 100 officers have left the department of taken a leave of absence so far in 2020. Mayor Jacob Frey on Sept. 22 released his 2021 budget proposal, which does not completely abolish or defund police but does include\u00a0a $14 million cut to the department's funding. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also acknowledged a rise in crime in New York City in a Sept. 24 press conference, and\u00a0New York\u00a0City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea\u00a0told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo on Sept. 25 that the city's cuts to the police budget have\u00a0\"certainly had a significant impact\" on crime.

REUTERS/Jeenah Moon \"In order for reform to be feasible, people do need to feel a degree of safety and order, so I do think the rising level of homicide does complicate the movement for reforming police,\"\u00a0Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University,\u00a0told Fox News. He added: \"What the activists push for and what the mainstream politician advances are often quite different,\" noting that 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said he does not support defunding police. VIOLENT CRIME IN US CITIES SURGES AMID PANDEMIC, PROTESTS: 'PERFECT STORM OF DISTRESS' Wasow also noted that the rise in homicides and gun violence has occurred \"without any defunding of police\" in reference to 2021 budget cuts that have not been implemented yet. \"These are policy debates that are happening now, but...at current levels of funding, we're seeing a rise in homicides.\" Cassell said while it's too early to tell whether there is any kind of correlation between the \"defund the police\" movement and spikes in violent crime, there appears to be a correlation between police reassignments amid nationwide protests and violent crime. In his\u00a0Sept. 10\u00a0research paper\u00a0titled\u00a0\"Explaining the Recent Homicide Spikes in U.S. Cities: The 'Minneapolis Effect' and the Decline in Proactive Policing,\" Cassell notes that many police were reassigned from proactive policing duties to help control protests in cities across the country amid unrest this summer that has continued into the fall. A protester carries the carries a U.S. flag upside, a sign of distress, next to a burning building Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cassell said\u00a0crime spikes could be \"projecting what would happen into the fall or next year if 'defunding the police' is taken to its logical conclusion.\" \"Defunding the police means, at some level,\u00a0cutting back on law enforcement activities,\" he said. \"... So I think we can project, just as the police have had to pull back this summer due to the protests, if they have to pull back due to defunding, we can expect high levels are particularly homicides or shootings to persist and maybe even increase further.\" He added that he doesn't think \"anyone wants to defund the police.\" \"I do think that, as a country, you can have a robust and serious discussion about whether certain activities could be shifted from the police department to other social service agencies...and I think that is happening.\" Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.

EXCLUSIVE: Black Lives Matter Chicago\u00a0co-founder Aislinn Pulley says the recent looting in Chicago undercuts the message the organization is trying to convey, while faulting Mayor Lori Lightfoot for slow-pedaling reforms in the city's police department. While not outwardly dismissing the looting and property damage, Pulley acknowledged it doesn't help address the problem of police brutality. \u201cI think the goal of the preoccupation around property damage and looting specifically, along the Mag Mile and in the heart of the city\u2019s commerce center, works to distract away from the actual cause of the outrage, the important thing is to intervene\u00a0and remind people what the causal incident was and continues to be.\u201d The unrest was prompted by a social media post urging people to converge on Chicago\u2019s business district after\u00a0police shot a young Black man\u00a0on the South Side around 2:30 p.m. Sunday. JOHN LOTT: CHICAGO'S CRIME PROBLEM \u2014 THIS IS REAL REASON BEHIND IT THAT CITY'S DEM MAYOR WILL NEVER ADMIT Officers\u00a0had responded to a call about a man with a gun in the Englewood neighborhood.\u00a0While being pursued by police, the man, Latrell Allen,\u00a0\u201cturned and fired shots\u201d at officers before\u00a0being\u00a0struck himself\u00a0and taken to a local hospital,\u00a0Deputy Chief\u00a0Delonda\u00a0Tally told\u00a0Fox 32 Chicago. A pedestrian hops over debris Monday, Aug. 10, 2020, after a jewelry store was vandalized in Chicago's famed Loop. Chicago\u2019s police commissioner says more than 100 people were arrested following a night of looting and unrest that left several officers injured and caused damage in the city\u2019s upscale Magnificent Mile shopping district and other parts of the city.\u00a0 (AP) Pulley lays the blame at the feet of Chicago's mayor, Lori Lightfoot, who unlike other local officials around the country, has\u00a0not enacted calls to defund\u00a0the police department's budget. \"The refusal to enact any meaningful change will mean that we will have continued instances like this\u2026.the way to resolve that is to actually address the root problems, it\u2019s not with Target, its not with Macy\u2019s or the gold coast Cartier....we can draw links certainly to what gets prioritized, but the root problem is that policing is the absolute same in this city,\" says Pulley. Pulley added:\u00a0\"There\u2019s been no significant decreases in the budget for CPD [Chicago Police Department], there hasn\u2019t even been a promise to decrease the budget for CPD, we\u2019ve seen other mayors across the country work with city councils to enact change, that has not occurred here.\u201d Lightfoot, on the other hand, took the opposite approach, adopting a strong tone in response to the looting in the heart of the Windy City. DEMOCRAT CHICAGO ALDERMAN SAYS CITY IS IN 'TOTAL UNREST' AND 'MAYOR HAS LOST CONTROL' Speaking at a press conference on Monday, she excoriated those who destroy property. \"There is no justification for criminal behavior ever. You have no right, no right to take and destroy the property of others. Our residents deserve to be safe. Our businesses deserve to understand and enjoy safety and security of their property and in our employees and our police officers deserve to be able to do their job without having to worry about shots being fired, projectiles being thrown and being maced. This is not anywhere near acceptable.\" Around 12:20 a.m. Monday, hundreds of people\u00a0descended on downtown Chicago, smashing the windows of businesses, and making off with merchandise, cash machines\u00a0and whatever else they could carry, police said. BLACK LIVES MATTER HOLDS RALLY IN CHICAGO TO SUPPORT THOSE ARRESTED AFTER LOOTING, UNREST By morning, the city had raised its bridges across the Chicago River\u00a0to prevent more unrest. Illinois state police had blocked off some expressway ramps into downtown, while CTA [chicago transit authority} had suspended train and bus services. Access was restored later in the day. BLM Chicago, however, has no plans to stop demonstrating. The looting and vandalism is not preventing organizers from making their voices heard. Asked by Fox News\u00a0if the peaceful protests can continue with property destruction concurrently taking place in the form of looting and vandalism, Pulley offered a full-throated affirmation. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"Remaining in the streets in terms of organizing, in terms of protest, marching and rallying should continue and will continue, we will continue to have unrest, intercommunal violence and these things until the root causes are resolved.\"",

            "article_content": "Protesters flooded the streets from coast to coast Saturday; Claudia Cowan has the details. The costliest civil disorder in U.S. history: That's what insurance experts and city officials say the riots and demonstrations following the death of George Floyd are shaping up to be. From police overtime to losses from fire -- as well as theft and other destruction -- costs of the unrest are adding up. And for the first time since statistics were collected in 1950, the insurance industry has labeled this a \u201criot and civil disorder\" catastrophe in multiple states. \u201cThe riots in the Minneapolis area are the first riot and civil disorder event designated by [Property Claim Services] since the 2015 Baltimore riots,\" Tom Johansmeyer, CEO of Property Claim Services (PCS), said Friday. \"We continue to monitor for insured losses outside Minnesota, and the event has become the first PCS and civil disorder event to include more than one state.\u201d POLS FACE IRE OF 'DEFUND THE POLICE' FORCE, FROM SEATTLE TO NEW YORK CITY Thousands of people have peacefully demonstrated across the United States against Floyd's death, but in the early days, protests escalated into violence and vandalism in a number of cities at night. Prior to 2020, the costliest civil disorder event in U.S. was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, according to PCS, the insurance industry's primary source for compiling and reporting insured losses resulting from catastrophes, from hurricanes to wildfires. That five-day event caused about $1.4 billion in 2020 dollars, according to PCS. Two days of riots following the funeral of Freddie Gray caused $26 million in losses in Baltimore alone. But losses stemming from the Floyd protests are likely to far exceed that. In Minneapolis, where some 400 businesses were damaged, owners and insurance experts estimate costs of the damage to exceed $500 million, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \u201cI am confident to say we will be seeing collectively more substantial losses than we have seen in these single city incidents,\u201d said CEO Sean Kevelighan with the Insurance Information Institute. Nationwide, Floyd related protests and riots lasted 3 weeks in 140 U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., New York; Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. By June 4 at least 40 cities in 23 states had imposed curfews. High-end boutiques in Beverly Hills and New York like Gucci and Chanel were looted, luxury stores in Santa Monica and big box retailers like Target and Macy\u2019s across the US have suffered tens of millions in losses. PORTLAND POLICE ARREST 8 DURING WEEKEND PROTEST, FIND ANTI-POLICE \u2018KILL ALL COPS\u2019 GRAFFITI ON BUILDINGS The National Guard were called in at least 21 states. David Weiss owns Lone Wolf Cigars in Los Angeles. One store in Santa Monica was destroyed on the second day of protests in Los Angeles. He hired private security to guard his second location the following week. \"The Santa Monica location was completely decimated, ravaged. Nothing to be salvaged,\" Weiss said standing inside a second his store in West L.A. \u201cThis is our Alamo. It's a last stand. If I don't stand here, my kids don't have a way to eat. My staff doesn't have a way to eat, pay rent. We don't have a choice.\u201d Consider this sampling of costs outside insured losses: In California, the state general services department says it spent $2 million repairing state buildings, from boarding up windows to repairing granite and removing graffiti. The state also spent over $38.2 million in California Highway Patrol overtime costs and $25 million deploying the National Guard. In Seattle, taxpayers spent $6.3 million in overtime, $67,478 on riot gear and $31,172 on pepper spray, flash bangs and other less than lethal weapons, according to SPD.\u00a0 Police overtime in Portland, Oregon totaled $6.2 million. LAPD patrol cars cost $80,000 each. Eight, according to the department, were totaled and 148 others were damaged, with broken windows, slashed tires and graffitti scrawled across the cars saying\u00a0\u201cmurderers,\u201d \"kill all cops\u201d and \u201csay his name.\u201d LAPD racked up $40 million in overtime -- but because the city is out of cash, a memo from Chief Michael Moore says officers must take comp time, leaving fewer officers on the street. COLORADO POLICE ARREST 3 AFTER CIVIL WAR STATUE PEDESTAL IS SET ON FIRE On Monday, the LAPD and the FBI held a joint press conference morning offering $10,000 for information leading to those suspected of vandalism, arson and attacks on police. \"We are looking for these suspects related to looting arson and assaults on police officers and other victims,\" said LAPD Deputy Chief Kris Pritcher. \u201cChunks of concrete, pieces of rebar, full bottles of bleach. A variety of different weapons and it didn\u2019t just include the officers but rather also civilians.\u201d It comes as police departments are already dealing with shortfalls related to the coronavirus crisis. \u201cSo when you're dealing with more cost to try to deal with this, with the current unrest in the society, we're also having to think about how we're going to deal with the shortfalls that we have because of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said officer Marco Monteblanco of the Washington State Fraternal Order of Police. He added: \u201cTo deal with hundreds and hundreds of individuals who are attacking people, who are burning buildings, who are damaging property, that takes a toll both on response times for the public because we're reallocating all of our resources to deal with that situation and things are not getting answered.\u201d In Tucson, police overtime for one night May 30 cost taxpayers more than $100,000 for 239 employees, about the annual salaries of two rookie officers. On that same Saturday night, Cleveland police racked up $3 million in overtime. Even small towns incurred costs:\u00a0Fargo, N.D., spent $840,000 and Harrisburg, Pa., $50,000 in overtime. LATEST SEATTLE CHOP SHOOTING SEES ONE DEAD, ANOTHER IN CRITICAL CONDITION \u201cFortunately, we only had one day of social unrest, whereas other cities had four, five, six, seven days,\u201d said Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson. \u201cIn order for us to do what we had to do, we had to spend over $3 million in overtime.\u201d But the highest costs related to the demonstrations are likely property damage, where thousands of businesses were damaged or destroyed. \"Fire, physical objects being thrown, automobiles being damaged, or even if people were on the job, there may be workman's comp claims,\" said Kevelighan of the Insurance Information Institute. \"The larger the city, you will have a higher ratio of self-insurance. What does that mean? That means taxpayers dollars will have to go to any losses that occurred and that puts a strain on the budget,\u201d Kevelighan said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Property Claims Services made its determinations about the \u201ccivil disorder event\u201d by talking to insurance companies. Homeowner, auto and business owner policies can cover damage from civil unrest, but how that will shake out is still being added up. Industry executives expect most claims will come from commercial policies. \"When you look at the U.S., riot and civil disorder may generally appear as a sub-$100 million risk, with the potential for much greater losses. But, when you add a handful of large national or international companies with losses of more than $100 million each, you could see a much larger industry loss begin to materialize. The large losses within the catastrophe could change the character of the overall event,\u201d said Johansmeyer of Property Claim Services. During the latest demonstrations, looters struck at least 250 CVS pharmacies and 350 Walgreens nationwide. None of the figures so far include lawsuits. Payouts are likely to hit taxpayers and ratepayers alike, as claims against cops for unnecessary force begin to hit cities, many of whom are self-insured. Black Lives Matter is suing federal officials for actions taken in Lafayette Square across from the White House. Other lawsuits have been filed by protesters alleging injuries by police from foam bullets and other non-lethal forms of crowd control. The Legal Aid Society of New York City sued the city over an alleged violation of a rule that arrested New Yorkers must be arraigned within 24 hours of their arrest.",

Leslie Neal-Boylan, the dean of the nursing school at\u00a0the\u00a0University of Massachusetts-Lowell, was allegedly fired after she received backlash from a student about an email to the campus community saying \"EVERYONE'S LIFE MATTERS.\" HARVARD GRAD BLAMES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AFTER 'STAB' VIDEO COSTS HER DELOITTE JOB Neal-Boylan, who held her position with the school for 10 months before being dismissed on June 19, wrote an email to the nursing school community addressing the ongoing protests across the country against police brutality and racial inequality following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Leslie Neal-Boylan, the dean of the nursing school at\u00a0the\u00a0University of Massachusetts-Lowell was fired after sending an email to the campus community saying \"EVERYONE'S LIFE MATTERS.\" \"I am writing to express my concern and condemnation of the recent (and past) acts of violence against people of color,\"\u00a0the email provided to\u00a0Campus Reform, dated June 2, said. \"Recent events recall a tragic history of racism and bias that continue to thrive in this country. I despair for our future as a nation if we do not stand up against violence against anyone. BLACK LIVES MATTER, but also, EVERYONE'S LIFE MATTERS.\" \u201cNo one should have to live in fear that they will be targeted for how they look or what they believe,\" the email continues, urging the nursing school students to \"care for\u00a0everyone\u00a0regardless of race, creed, color, religion, ethnicity, ability or gender preference.\" A nursing student took issue with the dean's choice of words and posted the email on Twitter saying,\u00a0\"including the statement \u2018all lives matter\u2019 was uncalled for and shows the narrow minded people in lead positions.\" The university responded to the student on Twitter and said \"Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The university hears you and we believe black lives matter,\" redirecting her to a statement by the chancellor of the university addressing the Black Lives Matter movement. After her termination,\u00a0Neal-Boylan reached out to UML Chancellor Jacqueline Moloney, Provost Joseph Hartman\u00a0and Provost Julie Nash, accusing the university of using her email regarding Black Lives Matter as an excuse to fire her. She said she had spoken\u00a0up about other, unrelated school issues in the past, according to emails reviewed by Campus Reform. Her firing was \"attributable to one phrase in my initial email that otherwise was very clearly a message to NOT discriminate against anyone,\"\u00a0Neal-Boylan said. \"To those students who were upset regarding my email, wouldn't it have been better to use that as a teachable opportunity to explain that leaders also make mistakes and use this as an example of why lifelong learning is so important?\"\u00a0Neal-Boylan wrote. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The dean added that she would not be pursuing legal action against the school because \"I know this would fuel the conservative opposition to the BLM movement and that would be anathema to me.\" A spokesperson for the University of Massachusetts-Lowell told\u00a0Fox News that the decision to fire Neal-Boylan \"was made in the best interests of the university and its students.\" \"Although we are not able to discuss specifics of a personnel matter, it would be incorrect to assume any statement by Dr. Neal-Boylan was the cause of that decision,\" the spokesperson added.",

            "article_content": " The nation went up in flames this weekend. No one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered. They cowered. They openly sided with the destroyers. In many cases, they egged them on. Later, they will deny doing any of this. They are denying it now. But you know the truth because you saw it happen. This is how nations collapse. When no one in authority keeps the order, and when someone in our professional class encourage violence, American citizens are forced to defend themselves. They have no choice. No one else is going to defend them -- they know that now. GEORGE FLOYD UNREST: CITIES FACE NEW LOOTING AMID STRONGER NATIONAL GUARD RESPONSE, CURFEWS It's possible that more people will be hurt in coming days -- that would be a tragedy. But in an environment like this, more violence could very well lead to a cascade of new tragedies, to something far bigger and more destructive than anything we have seen so far. So, this isn't over. It might simply be the beginning. We pray it isn't. It's hard to think clearly about anything that's going on right now. The chaos, the destruction, the relentless lying from above -- it's all too much. Americans are bewildered, and they are afraid. But most of all, they are filled with rage, angrier than they have ever been. The worst people in our society have taken control. They did nothing to build this country. Now, they are tearing it down. They are rushing us toward mass suicide. So, how do we respond? We must protect ourselves and our families. Once again, we have no choice, but to do that. But we cannot allow ourselves to become like they are. We are not animals, we are Americans. In the face of such indecency, we must resolve to be decent. We believe this country has a future. We intend for our children to live and thrive here. That is what we are defending. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER All our leaders do is set us against each other. They stage a never-ending national cockfight for their profit and amusement. But we're not going to play along. We will love our neighbors relentlessly in spite of all of it, not because they look like us or share our political views. But we love them because they are human beings, and they are Americans. Those are the bonds that tie us together -- the bonds our leaders seek to destroy. We can't let them. We should start by being unsparingly honest about what is happening right now. Truth is our defense, and it's our country's last hope. We plan to use this hour to create a record of this moment right now, to show you what's really going on in your country. We feel an obligation to do that before the facts are spun into propaganda by the liars or the images are pulled off the internet forever, as many of them inevitably will be. All our leaders do is set us against each other. They stage a never-ending national cockfight for their profit and amusement. But we're not going to play along. We're going to begin\u00a0with where my family lives and has lived for 35 years, in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. This is called Mac Market. It's on MacArthur Boulevard, which is named after General MacArthur during the war. It's our neighborhood store; it's walking distance from my house. People meet there every morning for coffee. Kids come after school for candy. It's as close to a community gathering spot as we have. The market is run by the Kim family. The Kims are immigrants from Korea. They are revered in our neighborhood for their decency and their hard work. When they lost their son several years ago, the neighbors grieved for them. The Kims are not political. They've never hurt anyone. They only make things better. But last night, the mob came for their store. At 1\u00a0a.m. Monday morning, Mr. Kim was kneeling alone on the sidewalk trying to salvage what he has spent his life building. Scenes like this played out in hundreds of neighborhoods across this country, maybe yours. Here are a few. In Columbia, S.C., a man called the police when things began to fall apart. Rioters saw him call. They surrounded that man, and they beat him. Onlookers laughed as he was pummeled. This is a national emergency. It's a profound national emergency. But you would never know that from listening to our elected leaders. Almost all of them pretend this is not really happening or if it is happening, it is just part of America's long tradition of vigorous political discourse. In Rochester, N.Y., a group of eight men smashed the windows of a jewelry store. The couple who lived above the shop emerged to confront them. Both of them were viciously beaten with a ladder and a two-by-four. In Dallas, a man armed with what appeared to be a sword did his best to defend a business from looters. The mob bashed him in the head with a rock and a skateboard. It's hard to watch. In San Jose, riders with crowbar stormed the highway and attacked vehicles, trying to pull drivers from their cars. In Birmingham, Ala., a local reporter called Stephen Quinn was beaten, and then he was robbed on live television as he tried to cover the looting. In Portland, Ore., a man was beaten apparently for daring to carry an American flag in public. He never released the flag, by the way. How many of these people died? How many were murdered by the rioters? We don't know yet. At the least, some are likely disabled for life. They were beaten that badly. And then there was the mass stealing. It seemed to be everywhere over the weekend. In Buckhead, an upscale part of Atlanta, rioters stole a Tesla from a dealership and drove it through an indoor mall just to underscore how completely out of control things were. In Portland, Oregon, mobs looted Louis Vuitton, Apple and Chase Bank among many others. They often set fires as they left.\u00a0In Chicago, protesters fought systemic racism by running through a Nike store stealing shoes. And in Washington, D.C., a federal city surrounded by military bases and protected at all times by the single highest concentration of law enforcement in the world, criminals operated with apparent impunity in the streets. They looted Georgetown. They smashed the windows in federal buildings. They desecrated virtually every war memorial in the city a week after Memorial Day. You've got to wonder how many of them have ever even heard of George Floyd. And if they have heard of him, what difference would it make? Violence and looting are not forms of political expression. And then, as you likely know, Sunday\u00a0night they set fire to St. John's Episcopal Church, a 200-year-old building that has welcomed every American president since James Madison. It is right across the street from the White House. For people stuck inside anywhere during this insanity -- the sick, the elderly, the powerless -- the experience was terrifying. Listen to this woman from Minneapolis. Reporter: How was last night? Unidentified woman: Scary. They went straight to Office Max, the Dollar Store and every store over here that I go to. I have nowhere to go now. I have no way to get there because the buses aren't running. So, that's what's happening in America right now. We didn't play all of the tape we have. There's a lot of it. Some of the tape is too shocking, and honestly, it's too incendiary. We understand that television is an emotional medium, and we don't want to make things worse. We're not going to, but you get the point. The point is, this is a national emergency. It's a profound national emergency. But you would never know that from listening to our elected leaders. Almost all of them pretend this is not really happening or if it is happening, it is just part of America's long tradition of vigorous political discourse. Politicians on both sides tell us that this is all about the death of a man in police custody in Minneapolis last week. The people burning down our country are \"protesters\". They're engaged in a legitimate \"protest.\" Okay, what exactly are those protesters' demands? What are they asking for? If Congress agreed to enact their program, what would the program be? Not a single person even hints the answer because there is not an answer. No one has bothered to pull the guys beating up old ladies on the street or looting Gucci, but you've got to wonder how many of them have ever even heard of George Floyd. And if they have heard of him, what difference would it make? Violence and looting are not forms of political expression. If you were killed tomorrow, how many buildings would you want burned to the ground in your memory? How many old women smashed in the face on the street in your name? None, we hope, because you're not a vicious psychopath, like the people you've just watched. In fact, what we're watching is not a political protest. It's the opposite of a political protest. It is an attack on the idea of politics. The rioters you have seen are trying to topple our political system. That system is how we resolve our differences without using violence. But these people want a new system, one that is governed by force. Do what we say or we will hurt you. You know this. You can see it for yourself on television;\u00a0you have. But our leaders continue to lie. They tell us that's not true. This isn't happening. It's just a protest. When the violence began, what we needed more than anything was clarity in the middle of this ...\u00a0\u00a0Instead, almost all of our so-called conservative leaders joined the left's chorus, as if on cue. Some Democrats have openly embraced what is happening. Really they don't have much of a choice. These are their voters cleaning out the Rolex store. These riots effectively are the largest Joe Biden for President rally on record. In gratitude for that, more than a dozen Joe Biden for President campaign staffers donated money to the rioters in Minneapolis, and then they bragged about it on Twitter. No Democratic leader can directly criticize what is happening right now. And in fact, some have joined in. Over the weekend, the Democratic Party of Fairfax, Virginia, which is an important Democratic organization, released the following statement on Twitter: \"Riots are an integral part of this country's march towards progress.\" Progress.\u00a0Burning buildings, teargas, dead bodies, the screaming injured, criminal anarchy -- to the Democratic Party of Fairfax, that is called progress. Celebrity after celebrity has weighed in to agree on social media. From his fortified compound, basketball star LeBron James has used his accounts to encourage more rioting. Bernie Sanders surrogate Shaun King has done the same. So has\u00a0Black Lives Matter leader, DeRay Mckesson. Colin Kaepernick openly calls for violence. Here's a quote: \"The cries for peace will rain down and when they do, they will land on deaf ears,\" he says approvingly. Imagine shouting fire in a crowded theater, a theater with 325 million people in it called our country. That's what they've been doing and have been doing for days. When the violence began, what we needed more than anything was clarity in the middle of this. It's hard to see when the tear gas starts. Someone in America needed to tell the truth to the country. Instead, almost all of our so-called conservative leaders joined the left's chorus, as if on cue. On Friday, as American cities were being destroyed by mobs, the vice president United States refused to say anything specific about the riots we were watching on television. Instead, Mike Pence scolded America for its racism. Carly Fiorina, once a leading Republican presidential candidate tweeted that -- and we're quoting, \"It's white America that now must see the truth, speak the truth and act on the truth.\" Meanwhile, Kay Coles James, who is the president of the Heritage Foundation -- that's the largest conservative think tank in the country. You may have sent them money, hopefully for the last time. Kay Coles James wrote a long scream denouncing America as an irredeemably racist nation: \"How many times will protests have to occur?\" Got that? \"Have to occur.\" Like the rest of us caused this by our sinfulness. The message from our leaders on the right, as on the left, was unambiguous: Don't complain. You deserve what's happening to you. No one jumped in more forcefully or seemed angrier in America than former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. \"Tonight I turned on the news and I am heartbroken,\" Haley wrote. \"It's important to understand that the death of George Ford was personal and painful for many. In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.\" Imagine shouting fire in a crowded theater, a theater with 325 million people in it called our country. That's what they've been doing and have been doing for days. But wait a second, you may be wondering, how am I\u00a0\"personally responsible\" for the behavior of a Minneapolis police officer? I've never even been to Minneapolis, you may think to yourself. And why is some politician telling me I'm required to be upset about it? Those are all good questions. Nikki Haley did not answer those questions explaining. It is not her strong suit -- that would require thinking. What Nikki Haley does best is moral blackmail. During the 2016 campaign, she compared Donald Trump to the racist mass murderer, Dylann Roof. How is Donald Trump similar to a serial killer? Nikki Haley never explained that. She wasn't trying to educate anyone. Her only goal was political advantage. Nikki Haley is exceptionally good at getting what she wants. She is happy to denounce you as a racist in order to get it. She just did. In this case, Nikki Haley's wish came true. The riots were indeed\u00a0\"personal and painful\" for everyone. And then the pain kept increasing. Two days after she wrote that, dozens of American cities had been thoroughly trashed, some destroyed. A country already on the brink of recession suddenly faced economic collapse. An already fearful population locked down for months because of the coronavirus had been thoroughly and completely terrorized. Mission accomplished. Let's hope Nikki Haley is pleased. We've now atoned. How did the Trump administration respond to the horrors going on around us? Well, Sunday morning, the country's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, did a live interview from the White House lawn. Here's how it began: Robert O'Brien, U.S. National Security Adviser: First thing I want to say, on behalf of the president --he said this to the family -- but our hearts and prayers are going out to the Floyd family. We mourn with them and we grieve with them and what happened there was horrific and I can't even imagine what that poor family is going through as his videos are played over and over again. That should have never happened in America and it's a tragic thing. The president said that from the start, and we're with the family and as the President said, we're with the peaceful protesters. \"We're with the peaceful protesters,\" O'Brien announced. Really? Can you be more specific about that? Who are you talking about exactly? Is it the people spitting foam as they scream, \"F the police\"? Is it the one standing next to the arsonist doing nothing as they set fire to buildings? Is it the kids laughing as they film the looting and the beatings on their iPhones? The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over the people in your care. That's what soldiers want from their officers. It's what families need from their fathers. It's what voters demand from their presidents. Maybe it's the famous people in L.A. who are raising money online to support the rioters? They're all just peaceful protesters. Yes, we support that. It's who we are. What about the president? Where is he during all of this? Well, on Friday night, after the show, Leland Vitter and a cameraman headed to Lafayette Square in Washington to cover what was happening outside the White House. Here's what happened next. Reporter: A Fox News reporter is getting chased out by these -- by the George Floyd protesters here in front of -- at Lafayette Park. Look, there's water being thrown on the reporter here. This is just -- they took his mic. The just threw the mic at the reporter here. As you see guys, things are spiraling here quick at the protest. That was in Lafayette Square in the center of our capital city. The tape raised a troubling question: If you can't keep a Fox News correspondent from getting attacked directly across the street from your house, how can you protect my family? How are you going to protect the country? How hard are you trying? On Twitter the next morning, the president reassured America that he and his family were just fine. The federally funded bodyguards had kept them safe. He did not mention protecting the rest of the nation, much of which was then on fire. He seemed aware only of himself. For people who like Donald Trump, who voted for Donald Trump, who support his policies, who have defended him for years and years against the most absurd kinds of slander, this was a distressing moment. The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over the people in your care. That's what soldiers want from their officers. It's what families need from their fathers. It's what voters demand from their presidents. People will put up with almost anything if you do that. You can regularly say embarrassing things on television. You can hire Omarosa to work at the White House. All of that will be forgiven if you protect your people. But if you do not protect them -- or worse than that, if you seem like you can't be bothered to protect them --\u00a0then you're done. It's over. People will not forgive weakness. That's the one thing, by the way, that is not a partisan point. It is human nature. Nero is the only Roman emperor whose name most people still remember. Why? Because he abandoned his nation in a time of crisis. And 2,000 years later, we still don't forgive him. Donald Trump's response to these riots, which is ongoing, is the singular test of his presidency. About an hour ago, the president announced that he's going to marshal all available forces -- military and civilian -- to stop these riots. President Donald Trump: If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. Good for him. Immediately after that address, the president walked over to St. John's, which, we just told you, was burning fewer than 24 hours ago, and that provided a powerful symbolic gesture. It was a declaration that this country -- our national symbols, our oldest institutions -- will not be desecrated and defeated by nihilistic destruction. We fervently hope this all works. What Americans want most right now is an end to this chaos. They want their cities to be saved. They want this to stop immediately. If the commander-in-chief cannot stop it, he will lose in November. The left will blame him for the atrocities they encouraged, and some voters will agree. Donald Trump is the president. Presidents save countries. That's their job. That's why we hire them. It's that simple. Some key advisers around the president don't seem to understand this or the gravity of the moment. No matter what happens, they'll tell you, our voters aren't going anywhere. \"The trailer parks are rock solid. What choice do they have? They've got to vote for us.\" Jared Kushner, for one, has made that point out loud. No one has more contempt for Donald Trump's voters than Jared Kushner does, and no one expresses it more frequently. In 2016, Donald Trump ran as a law and order candidate because he meant it, and his views remain fundamentally unchanged today. But the president's famously sharp instincts, the ones that won him the presidency almost four years ago, have been since subverted at every level by Jared Kushner. This is true on immigration, on foreign policy, and especially on law enforcement. As crime in this country continues to rise, Jared Kushner has led a highly aggressive effort to let more criminals out of prison and back on to the streets. This is reckless. At this moment in time, it is insane. It\u00a0continues to happen. What Americans want most right now is an end to this chaos. They want their cities to be saved. They want this to stop immediately. If the commander-in-chief cannot stop it, he will lose in November. The left will blame him for the atrocities they encouraged, and some voters will agree. The president seems to sense this. At times he seems aware he is being led in the wrong direction. He often derides Kushner as a liberal and that's correct, Kushner is. But Kushner has convinced the president that throwing open the prisons is the key to winning African-American votes in the fall and that those votes are essential to his reelection. Several times over the past few days, the president has signaled that he would very much like to crack down on rioters -- that is his instinct. If you've watched him, you'll believe it. But every time he has been talked out of it by Jared Kushner and by aides that Kushner has hired and controls. Kushner's assumption, apparently, is that African-American voters like looting. That is wrong. Normal Americans of all colors hate looting, obviously. Why wouldn't they hate looting? They are decent people. So one of the lessons of all that we have seen and we've seen so much over the past five days is America is going to change because of this -- that is certain. What can we learn from it? What should we demand going forward? The first thing to know is that we can no longer accept race-baiting from our leaders. Never. That has become so common now that we barely notice it. But it is dividing and destroying this country. We should make them stop. On Sunday, for example, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle tweeted this: \"I want to acknowledge that much of the violence and destruction both here in Seattle and across the country has been instigated and perpetrated by white men.\" Is that factually true? Who knows? Who cares? The skin color of criminals is totally irrelevant to how we prosecute them for the crimes they commit. It must be irrelevant. Otherwise, we're committing the bigotry we claim to abhor. Weakness invites aggression. That is true in nature and it's every bit as true in human society. Our leaders are weak. Predators know it. That's why this is happening. Yet everywhere on television and social media, prominent people are now talking exactly like this. Not just a few crackpots -- thousands of people, well-known people. They are amplifying race hatred at exactly the moment that we need at least at the moment when it's the most dangerous. This is Art Acevedo. Acevedo with the police chief of Houston. Houston is the fourth biggest city in this country. Acevedo's job, his sworn duty, is to enforce the law fairly and evenly regardless of the ethnicity of the suspect. Watch this and tell us if you think he is capable of doing that. Do you think he's even interested? Art Acevedo, chief of the Houston Police department: My people for -- as an immigrant, we are raised like this. But you know what? We built this country ... We have got news for them. We ain't going nowhere. We ain't going nowhere. I think the ship has sailed. So if you've got hate in your heart for people of color, get over it, because this city is a minority-majority city. \"My people.\" If a police chief of any color -- any color -- said that, we would attack him instantly, and we would mean it. It is wrong. When you run a law enforcement agency, you don't get to consider\u00a0\"my people\" much less claim your people deserve some kind of special consideration because they \"built this country.\" No. Your obligation is not to consider your people, but all people and consider them equally. Period. Art Acevedo is not even trying to do that. Imagine being arrested by this creep. Think you'd get a fair shake? There's almost nothing that hurts America more than this. If you are worried about the rise of extremism here -- and honestly, you should be worried -- this kind of insanity is absolutely certain to cause it. And let's be clear, when we say extremism, we're not talking about unconventional views that get you bounced off Twitter or scolded by the corporate HR department. We mean actual extremism where people espouse violence against other people, where large groups come to believe their racial identity is the most important thing about them. Now, at this moment, no matter what they're telling you, no matter what they claim for political advantage, there's not a huge amount of that in this country, thank God. Most people still think of themselves as Americans and want to. But if the left keeps talking like this, there definitely will be and very soon. And you don't want to live here when that happens. We should demand they stop immediately. Enforcing the law is not white supremacy. Insisting that everyone in the country follow\u00a0the same rules is not racism. In fact, it's the answer to racism. It is equality -- equality under the law. It is the one thing we must defend, and if we don't, it's over. Things fall apart. Weakness invites aggression. That is true in nature and it's every bit as true in human society. Our leaders are weak. Predators know it. That's why this is happening. If you let people spray paint obscenities in City Hall, pretty soon they are overturning cop cars. If you put up with that, they'll come right to the front door of the police precinct, and they will burn it down.

            "article_content": "Media rips President Trump over civil unrest in America. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo raised eyebrows on Tuesday night when he suggested that the George Floyd\u00a0protesters don't have to be \"polite and peaceful.\" Cuomo blasted those who believe the national \"problem\" is the riots that have taken place following the death of George Floyd and not the police brutality that prompted the nationwide protests. \"Now too many see the protests as the problem. No, the problem is what forced your fellow citizens to take to the streets: persistent, poisonous\u00a0inequities and injustice,\" Cuomo told his viewers. \"And please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful. Because I can show you that outraged citizens are what made the country what she is and led to any major milestone. To be honest, this is not a tranquil time.\" CNN'S DON LEMON SAYS 'WE ARE TEETERING ON A DICTATORSHIP' FOLLOWING TRUMP'S GEORGE FLOYD ADDRESS He later added, \"Police are the ones required to be peaceful, to deescalate, to remain calm.\" Critics slammed the \"Cuomo Prime Time\" anchor, many of them pointing to the Constitution. \"Yeah it's not like the First Amendment specifies our rights as 'peaceably to assemble,'\" The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech quipped. \"Protests absolutely don't have to be polite, but the law says they must be peaceful,\" Washington Examiner reporter Jerry Dunleavy told Cuomo. DOES TRUMP BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS ON JOURNALISTS DURING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS? \"Old line: the protests are mostly peaceful. New line: who says protests have to be peaceful?\" National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote. Donald Trump Jr. accused Cuomo of \"carrying water for violent criminals\" who have caused havoc in cities across the country. \"Imagine saying that less than a day since Captain David Dorn was killed in cold blood by looters? Truly disgusting,\" Trump Jr. wrote, referring to the St. Louis riot victim. Over the years, Cuomo has been accused of defending Antifa, the self-described \"anti-fascist\" movement that has incited violence at various protests across the country, including the George Floyd protests as many suspect. Back in 2018, he referred to Antifa as \"counterprotesters\" and argued\u00a0\u201call punches are not equal\u201d when they incite violence against racists. CNN'S OPINION-FUELED ANCHORS 'DISQUALIFY THEMSELVES' FROM MODERATING THE UPCOMING\u00a0PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, CRITICS SAY \u201cIf you\u2019re a punk who comes and starts trouble in a mask and hurt people, you\u2019re not about any virtuous cause. You\u2019re just somebody who\u2019s going to be held to the standard of doing something wrong,\" Cuomo explained. \u201cBut when someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot, even physical, are they equally wrong as the bigot they are fighting? I argue no.\u201d PBS REPORTER FACES BACKLASH FOR TELLING TRUMP THERE'S 'NO EVIDENCE' THAT ANARCHISTS APPEARED AT PROTESTS During a heated panel discussion in 2019, Cuomo went to bat for Antifa after a guest condemned its violence. \"You can talk about Antifa.\u00a0I've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, okay?\" Cuomo said. \"There are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The CNN anchor clarified that he did not\u00a0want to \"espouse Antifa,\" which Cortes argued he sounded like he was. \"You don't draw a moral equivalency between the neo-Nazis and the people there who fight against them,\" Cuomo said. \"You don't do that in that context because that's not what we are about.\"",

Unions representing millions of workers, from teachers to truck drivers, pledged to ramp up protests in the leadup to the presidential election, with walkouts aimed at\u00a0forcing local and federal lawmakers to pass police reform and address what they described as systemic racism. In a statement first shared with The Associated Press on Saturday, labor leaders from America's biggest public and private sector unions said they would organize walkouts for teachers, autoworkers, truck drivers and clerical staff, among others.

There will be a COVID vaccine soon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the question is whether it will be out yet this year or later in 2021. Either way, the global pandemic will be largely a non-issue a year from now. With that in mind, the real question is who has the better plan and the better record to get America working again?\u00a0Donald Trump wins in a landslide when applying that criteria to this election. The Great American Comeback is real under President Donald Trump. The American economy grew at the fastest pace ever recorded in the third quarter, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. And, as usual, it was higher than economists had predicted, which sets an even more positive trend for the future. President Trump knows how to get people back to work. GIANNO CALDWELL: WHY TRUMP'S REELECTION MAY BE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICA'S BLACK COMMUNITY Before coronavirus hit, America had recorded the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.\u00a0 Unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, people with disabilities, and veterans were all the lowest ever recorded by category. And women\u2019s share of payroll employment surpassed that of men. Under President Trump, real household median income hit the highest level ever recorded at $65,000. And the president\u2019s policies have increased real disposable income per household by almost $6,000. The Trump administration eliminated costly and unnecessary regulations on small businesses and other employers. These efforts are projected to increase household income by $3,100 per year.\u00a0Additionally, the promotion of energy exploration and production in resources like shale energy are expected to save American families an average of $2,500 in gasoline costs. That\u2019s real money. Prior to the global pandemic, nearly half a million manufacturing jobs were created under President Trump. Wages for blue-collar workers were growing faster than those of white-collar workers. In contrast, under President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, our country had one of the weakest economic recoveries since the Great Depression. Nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during their eight years in office. And an analysis published by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University finds that there will be 4.9 million fewer jobs under Joe Biden\u2019s plan than under Donald Trump\u2019s plan. Donald Trump signed one of the largest tax cuts in American history. The vast majority of hard-working people in our country benefited from the Trump tax cuts. Lowering the marginal tax rates, doubling the standard deduction, and doubling the size of the child tax credit helps everyday citizens. Donald Trump may not always talk and tweet the way we do in America\u2019s Heartland, but he gets the job done. Since the passage of the Trump tax cuts, millions of workers have received pay raises, bonuses or increased retirement contributions. Plus, the tax reform created Opportunity Zones to help low-income and distressed areas. In contrast, Joe Biden wants to repeal the Trump tax cuts. He said so over and over this year.\u00a0 You cannot repeal the tax cuts and then only tax people making more than $400,000.\u00a0 Repealing the tax cuts means most workers in America are going to see a tax increase under Biden\u2019s plan. Raising taxes is not the answer as we move forward with the recovery. Joe Biden is proposing to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. That would be the largest in U.S. history and four times as large as the increase proposed in 2016 by candidate Hillary Clinton. His higher taxes on employers would make it difficult for American businesses to compete with foreign companies. That would likely increase the move to send American jobs to other countries. Donald Trump got rid of the individual mandate that was a significant problem under\u00a0ObamaCare. He wants to repeal the rest of the failing program and replace it with a system that leads to lower health care costs and better treatment. In contrast, Joe Biden wants to expand\u00a0ObamaCare\u00a0to include a public option. This would open the door to our health care system being run by the federal government. Remember when they could not figure out the rollout of the\u00a0ObamaCare\u00a0website? Do you really want these people to make our health care decisions? Government-run health care will fail in America. It will end our private health plans and end up moving us and our families into a government-run system likely filled with fewer choices, higher costs and long waits for care. That\u2019s not the kind of America in which I want to live. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Washington is full of politicians who say all the right things but don\u2019t get squat done for the hard-working taxpayers. Donald Trump may not always talk and tweet the way we do in America\u2019s Heartland, but he gets the job done. If we have to pick between a talker and a doer, I will pick a doer every single time. Donald Trump is a doer.\u00a0He helped get Americans back to work before and he will again\u00a0\u2013\u00a0if given the chance for four more years. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

An Indiana woman was fatally shot earlier this month following an alleged argument between her family and a group of Black Lives Matter supporters, her family says. The woman, 24-year-old Jessica Doty Whitaker, was walking along Indianapolis Canal Walk with her fianc\u00e9, Jose Ramirez, and two other people around 3 a.m. on July 5 when someone in their group used a racial slur, Fox 59 reported. Whitaker was taken to a hospital where she died, her family says.\u00a0 (GoFundMe) A group of nearby strangers overheard the comment and confronted Whitaker\u2019s group, according to the station. Ramirez alleged that the group shouted\u00a0\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d to which either Whitaker or someone else in their group reportedly responded with, \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d A brief argument ensued until both sides separated after realizing the other was armed, Fox 59 reported. Ramirez claimed that both sides managed to resolve the argument before separating. But minutes later, someone reportedly opened fire from a nearby bridge, striking Whitaker, before running away, the station said. COLD CASE DISAPPEARANCE OF INDIANA WOMAN, 18, IN 1986 LEADS TO ARREST \u201cIt was squashed, and they went up the hill and left we thought, but they were sitting on St. Clair waiting for us to come under the bridge and that\u2019s when she got shot,\u201d Ramirez said.

He told Fox 59 that he has had to explain what happened to Whitaker\u2019s 3-year-old son. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell him his mom is in heaven and if you want to talk to her you have to look up and say, \u2018I love you mom,\u2019\u201d Ramirez said. Police have not independently verified whether the supposed argument over \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d occurred\u00a0or if the fatal shooting was even connected.

Lisa Murkowski on Sunday said her position \u201chas not changed,\u201d and that she \u201cwould not\u201d support taking up a potential Supreme Court nominee ahead of the 2020 presidential election, despite Senate Republican leadership plans to forge ahead in filling the vacancy left bythe late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a statement Sunday, said that \u201cfor weeks,\u201d she has said that she \u201cwould not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election.\u201d MURKOWSKI, PRIOR TO GINSBURG PASSING, SAID SHE 'WOULD NOT VOTE' TO CONFIRM A NOMINEE TO SUPREME COURT BEFORE THE ELECTION \u201cSadly, what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not support taking up a nomination eight months before the 2016 election to fill the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Scalia.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are now even closer to the 2020 election \u2014 less than two months out \u2014 and I believe the same standard must apply.\u201d Murkowski\u2019s comments come after Ginsburg passed away on Friday at the age of 87 from complications surrounding metastatic pancreatic cancer. Murkowski, prior to Ginsburg\u2019s passing, did an interview with Alaska Public Media, where she said she \u201cwould not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee.\u201d During the interview, Murkowski based her reasoning on precedent -- noting the situation surrounding former President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee and D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Obama nominated Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away in 2016, but Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination, citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. MCCONNELL: TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 'WILL RECEIVE A VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE' \u201cThat was too close to an election, and that the people needed to decide,\u201d Murkowski told Alaska Public Media, referencing McConnell\u2019s argument at the time. \u201cThat the closer you get to an election, that argument becomes even more important.\u201d Just hours after learning of Ginsburg\u2019s passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that a President Trump nominee to the high court to fill her vacancy \u201cwill receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d \u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term. We kept our promise,\u201d McConnell continued. \u201cSince the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.\u201d SCHUMER: GINSBURG VACANCY SHOULD NOT BE FILLED UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION McConnell added that \u201cby contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary.\u201d \u201cOnce again, we will keep our promise,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d But\u00a0the nomination and confirmation\u00a0process for the latest addition to the Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, took 89 days total for confirmation. It took 57 days from Kavanaugh's nomination to his confirmation hearing. There are 44 days until Election Day. Murkowski, during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process, was looked at as one of the final four swing senators who would determine whether the now-justice would be confirmed to the bench of the High Court. Murkowski remained undecided until the final hours prior to the confirmation vote. Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,said Saturday that whoever wins the presidency should\u00a0nominate the next justice. \"In order for the American people to have faith in their elected officials, we must act fairly and consistently -- no matter which political party is in power,\" Collins said in a tweeted statement. President Trump has the constitutional authority to make a nomination to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, and I would have no objection to the Senate Judiciary Committee's beginning the process of reviewing his nominee's credentials.\u201d \"Given the proximity of the presidential election ...\u00a0I do not believe that the Senate should vote on the nominee prior to the election. In fairness to the American people, who will either be reelecting the president or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the president who is elected in November 3.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump urged Senate Republicans to confirm his eventual nominee. \u201c@GOP We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWe have this obligation, without delay!\u201d He added.",

The Maine Republican famously voted to confirm then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite opposition from Democrats and a fellow moderate Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. That position earned her a wave of backlash\u00a0in the lead up to her re-election bid this November. Given Republicans' narrow majority in the Senate, lawmakers like Collins are critical to securing GOP victories. Immediately after Justice Ginsburg's death, observers raised questions about whether Collins, Murkowski, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who approved an article of impeachment this year against Trump, would allow a vote. After Ginsburg's death, Murkowski and Romney refrained from addressing a future vote in their statements, instead choosing to commemorate\u00a0the late justice. Murkowski, however, told Alaska Public Media just days prior that she \"would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee.\u00a0We are 50 some days away from an election.\" Before Ginsburg's death, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also indicated he wouldn't support a confirmation process\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\u201cIf I were chairman of the committee and this vacancy occurred, I would not have a hearing on it because that\u2019s what I promised the people in 2016,\u201d he said in July.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ordered a temporary stay of last week\u2019s lower-court order by U.S. District Judge Mariana Garcia Marmolejo. A sign to orient registered voters.\u00a0 (adacounty.id.gov) Marmolejo blocked Texas from eliminating straight-ticket voting, a decision that would allow for choosing one party's entire slate of candidates in the November election with a single stroke. Most states don't offer straight-ticket voting. Texas has for decades, but Republican Gov. Greg Abbott recently signed a law removing the option. That measure was pushed through by a GOP-controlled Legislature that argued the change would encourage voters to weigh down ballot races and cast better-informed ballots on Election Day. Democrats sued over the change in March, pointing toward long lines in Houston on Super Tuesday, when some voters waited more than an hour to vote. They said the law disproportionately hurts Black and Latino voters in big urban counties, where longer ballots result in longer wait times. BIDEN CAMPAIGN QUICKLY CAPITALIZES ON TRUMP TAXES REPORT WITH T-SHIRTS, BUTTONS AND STICKERS Garcia Mamolejo said claims that voting machines couldn't be reconfigured so close to the Nov. 3 election were unconvincing, doubting it \"will be as onerous as Texas claims.\" The lawsuit was filed in federal court along the Texas border in Laredo. It was one of several voting challenges filed by Democrats in Texas leading up to November. Republican leaders have refused to expand mail-in voting in Texas during the pandemic. Next week, the Texas Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that will determine whether Harris County can send mail-in voting applications to more than 2 million registered voters.

            "article_content": "<br> What happens if they don\u2019t do it? That was a question I posed during Fox News coverage of the 2020 election and the developing litigation landscape that surrounds it. That is, what if, after representing to the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court that it would segregate late-arriving ballots, Pennsylvania\u2019s county election boards failed to keep their promise \u2013 co-mingling and counting the ballots that came in from November 4 through 6, pursuant to a state court order, with those received on or before November 3, the Election Day deadline prescribed in law by the state legislature? The question required posing because of the Supreme Court\u2019s maddening timidity. The Court \u2013 or, at least, three justices of the Court \u2013 had cajoled Pennsylvania state officials to agree to segregate the late-arriving ballots in order to preserve the high court\u2019s ability to rule on their legality post-election. But the Court did not order the segregation. Instead, it relied on the good faith of state officials to both direct election boards in Pennsylvania\u2019s 67 counties to segregate the ballots, and to see that the election boards complied. Finally, on Friday night, Justice Samuel Alito went beyond merely encouraging the state to segregate the ballots. He issued a formal order that it be done. ALL EYES ON PA., OTHER BATTLEGROUNDS AS BIDEN INCREASES LEAD, TRUMP VOWS LEGAL FIGHT This is not the way a court normally works, let alone the nation\u2019s top judicial tribunal. Why didn\u2019t the Supreme Court order the segregation days ago, even weeks ago? Well,\u00a0because the court hasn\u2019t even decided to review the case. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, did the best they could to nudge Pennsylvania officials into doing the right thing. But they are playing a weak hand because of Machiavellian maneuvering by Chief Justice John Roberts. Acting more like a risk-averse politician than a jurist, the chief justice is trying to keep the Court out of cases that might impact the 2020 election. The legal issue is straightforward. Under the Constitution, state legislatures \u2013 not courts, not bureaucracies \u2013 have the power to set the rules for how an election is to be conducted. Moreover, it is politically accountable state officials \u2013 the legislature and governor \u2013 who have the responsibility to balance concerns about protecting citizens from an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, with concerns about protecting election integrity. That is not a job for courts. Consistent with these duties, the state legislature took several steps to liberalize mail-in voting so Pennsylvanians would have the option not to vote in-person during the pandemic. But they did so in a bipartisan compromise that quite intentionally left in place the statutory deadline for the receipt of mail-in ballots: November 3 at 8:00 p.m., when the polls close. Nevertheless, the Democratic Party-dominated state Supreme Court (judges are elected in Pennsylvania) countermanded this law in a 4-3 ruling. By judicial fiat, they ordered that ballots be accepted for three additional days \u2013 through Friday, November 6, at 5:00 p.m. Worse, in a move that patently invites fraud, the state judges ruled that if a ballot does not have a postmark, or is illegibly postmarked, it is to be deemed as if it were submitted on or before the November 3 election. BIDEN CLAIMS 'MANDATE' WHILE ELECTION VS TRUMP REMAINS UNDECIDED The state Republican Party has been attempting for weeks to get the Supreme Court to rule that the state court\u2019s directive is unconstitutional. But in mid-October, when there were still only eight members of the Court after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, Chief Justice Roberts voted with the Court\u2019s remaining liberals (Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan) to block the Court from considering the case. By rule, the 4-4 tie on the GOP\u2019s motion for a stay left the state supreme court\u2019s order in place. To be clear, the Supreme Court did not \u201capprove\u201d the state court\u2019s action; the justices simply took no action on the matter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Then, the state GOP asked the court to bypass consideration of a stay and rule on the merits of the case, but on an expedited basis\u00a0so there could be clarity before the election.\u00a0By then, Justice Amy Coney Barrett had just been confirmed, so it was possible that with nine justices the deadlock could be broken. Roberts, however, clearly wants to keep Barrett out of such cases, worried about playing into the Democrats\u2019 demagoguery that President Trump put Barrett on the Court to help him steal the election. Consequently, Justice Kavanaugh was persuaded to vote with Roberts and the three liberals \u2013 even though he had previously voted with his fellow conservatives, and has written opinions invalidating the kind of action the Pennsylvania court has taken. Since there were now five justices unwilling to agree to consider the case, at least on an expedited basis, Justice Barrett\u2019s vote was no longer important. She thus agreed, for now, to sit the case out. She has not recused herself; she has merely said she had not yet had time to bone up on and participate in cases that were pending before her appointment to the Court. Justices Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch \u201creluctantly\u201d agreed, in an October 28 statement (issued in the form of an opinion), that it was too late only five days before November 3 to consider the case on an expedited basis. But they pointed out that the Court had not declined to review the case. For now, the state GOP\u2019s application (known as a petition for a writ of certiorari \u2013 a \u201ccert\u201d petition) remains pending. The only thing the Court had declined to do was consider the case on an expedited basis pre-election. That did not mean the Court could not consider on an expedited basis post-election. As a practical matter, though, it would only make sense to rule on the dispute over late-arriving ballots if the state had not already commingled them with the timely ballots. If the state failed to segregate the late-arriving ballots, the state court\u2019s order could effectively escape the Supreme Court\u2019s review. Therefore, Alito, Thomas and Roberts wanted the state to segregate the disputed ballots \u2013 preserve the status quo so the Court would have the option of ruling on their legality after the election. Alas, those three justices appear to be on their own. Their six colleagues have not denied the cert petition \u2013 that would call for Roberts, Kavanaugh and Barrett to refuse to hear the case, a position they don\u2019t want to take. But for now, those justices are not taking any action at all. Roberts is betting that if the Court idles long enough, it can avoid any action that would be distorted by the media and Democrats as the conservative-majority Court deciding the presidential election. Without a majority of justices to work with, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch lacked the support to order Pennsylvania to segregate ballots. So instead, they prodded state election officials to do it. They signaled that they\u2019d entertain an emergency application by the GOP asking for an order that it be done if state officials volunteer to segregate. So the same day (October 28), the state agreed to issue \u201cguidance\u201d to the county election boards that the late-arriving ballots should be segregated. But understand: the Supreme Court did not issue an order.\u00a0The state\u2019s representation that it would issue guidance is not a guarantee that the guidance would be effective, and there was no assurance \u2013 other than good faith \u2013 that the ballots would actually be segregated. And that is why I asked: What happens if they don\u2019t do it? Almost instantly, it became clear that the three justices\u2019 reliance on the good faith of Pennsylvania officials was dubious. On November 1 \u2013 right before the election and just three days after its segregation representation to the Court \u2013 Pennsylvania officials issued new guidance that allowed the segregated votes to be counted. Thus, even though they are disputed, these ballots are being factored into the\u00a0very close race. Moreover, the state GOP pointed out that county election boards are not required to follow guidance from state election officials. There is no assurance that all 67 counties would or have followed the guidance. That was enough to force Justice Alito\u2019s hand. On Friday night, he issued the order. But note that he did in his role as the Circuit Justice responsible for emergency applications related to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is a lawful order, but it does not have the heft of an order from the full Supreme Court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There appear to be bigger potential legal issues in Pennsylvania than ballots arriving up to three days late pursuant to a state court order that has not been invalidated. In the end, there may relatively few late-arriving ballots, such that they would not affect the outcome of the election whether or not they were counted. Ironically, that may make Chief Justice Roberts more amenable to reviewing the case. It would be valuable to get a ruling since the issue of who gets to set election rules \u2013 state legislatures or courts \u2013 involves a constitutional imperative that will arise in future cases. How dismaying it would be, though, if the nation\u2019s highest court is too paralyzed to rule on an issue of great public significance until it is sure that its ruling won\u2019t matter in the here and now.

A new poll released on Sunday shows that a majority of U.S. voters prefer to have the Supreme Court Justice seat left vacant by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be filled after the November election. According to the data from a New York Times/Siena College survey, 56% of voters want the winner of the 2020 presidential election to nominate Ginsburg\u2019s replacement. About 41% want President Trump to make that decision now. President Donald Trump walks with Judge Amy Coney Barrett to a news conference to announce Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, Sept. 26, in Washington.

            "article_content": "The 'Special Report' panel compares and contrasts the Trump and Biden campaign strategies. The death of\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u00a0put the Supreme Court at the epicenter\u00a0of the 2020 presidential election, setting up a furious battle over who should fill the vacancy. Ginsburg, 87,\u00a0died Friday of complications from\u00a0metastatic pancreatic cancer, just weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, likely marking the start of a bitter partisan feud over who will fill her empty seat. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG DIES AT 87 Conservatives outnumbered liberals on the court 5-4 before the death of Ginsburg, a liberal stalwart. With a new right-leaning justice, conservatives could hold a solid 6-3 majority. At the beginning of September, President Trump unveiled a list of potential Supreme Court nominees should he have future vacancies to fill. The list included a trio of conservative senators -- Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., -- as well as Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Christopher Landau, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico. \u201cWow. I didn\u2019t know that,\" Trump told reporters Friday night when informed of Ginsburg's death. \"You\u2019re telling me now for the first time. She led an amazing life. What else can you say? She was an amazing woman, whether you agreed or not, she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life. I\u2019m actually saddened to hear that.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0has repeatedly said that he would move swiftly to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, despite opposing a push by Democrats and former President Barack Obama\u00a0to fill Justice Antonin Scalia's seat after he died in February 2016. McConnell reiterated that pledge on Friday night. \"Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary,\" McConnell said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cOnce again, we will keep our promise. President Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d SCHUMER: GINSBURG VACANCY SHOULD NOT BE FILLED UNTIL 'WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT' Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, and it's unclear that they have the necessary votes to nominate and confirm a new justice. A simple majority of senators present and voting is required for the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice. Several senators who are facing tight re-election odds this year, including Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,\u00a0in 2016 suggested the Senate should wait until after the November election to nominate and confirm a new justice. FLASHBACK: MCCONNELL VOWS TO FILL A SUPREME COURT VACANCY DURING ELECTION YEAR Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has already said the open seat should not be filled until after the Nov. 3 election. TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT LIST: POTUS REVEALS LIST OF MORE THAN 20\u00a0PEOPLE HE'D CONSIDER NOMINATING \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted on Friday. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to nominate a Black woman to the nation's highest court system. In a statement Friday night, the former vice president said the Senate should wait until after the election to nominate and confirm a new justice, citing Republicans' opposition in 2016 to Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat. \"The voters should pick a president, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg,\" he said. \"This was the position that the Republican Senate took in 2016, when there were nearly nine months before the election.\u00a0That is the position the United States Senate must take now, when the election is less than two months away.\"",

Texas offered straight-ticket voting\u00a0for decades, but in 2017,\u00a0Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law eliminating the option beginning\u00a0in the 2020 general election. A federal judge reinstated the practice this month, citing concerns about how the coronavirus pandemic could affect voting. NEW SUPER PAC LAUNCHES TO BOOST TRUMP IN AD WARS But the\u00a05th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision Wednesday, ruling that changes shouldn't be made so close to the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThe Texas Legislature passed HB 25 in 2017, and state election officials have planned for this election accordingly. The state election machinery is already well in motion,\u201d the panel of three judges, two of whom are conservative, wrote.\u00a0Eliminating straight-ticket voting and upholding the 2017 law, they said, \u201cwill minimize confusion among both voters and trained election officials.\u201d Early voting in Texas starts on Oct. 13.

HOLLYWOOD CELEBS FUEL TEXAS DEMS' FUNDRAISING PUSH IN BID TO TURN LONE STAR STATE BLUE Democrats had sued election officials from the Lone Star State\u00a0to restore straight-ticket voting in March, claiming that long lines on Super Tuesday were indicative of broader problems that Texas could face on Nov. 3. They argued that\u00a0eliminating straight-ticket voting disproportionately hurt Black and Latino communities\u00a0in big urban counties where ballots are longer, resulting in lengthier waiting times. \u201cIn ending a century-old voting practice that Texans have relied on to exercise their most fundamental and sacred rights \u2014 the rights to political participation and association \u2014 Texas has recklessly created a recipe for disaster at the polls in 2020,\u201d the lawsuit said.

            "article_content": "<br> With the presidential election still undecided, President Trump\u2019s campaign has launched a flurry of lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. The suits raise a range of claims. These include the exclusion of observers from vote-counting rooms, voting by non-residents, and even the counting of votes listed as being cast by people who have died. But the case that could decide it all started weeks ago, and is currently waiting at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Boockvar case involves a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court regarding how late mail-in ballots can be counted in that state. If the Supreme Court takes up this case and the presidential election hinges on the result of the vote in Pennsylvania, the high court could determine who is elected president. TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS VICTORY AS EARLY AS FRIDAY: 'DONALD TRUMP IS ALIVE AND WELL' The U.S. Constitution does not establish a system that uses the courts to pick the president. The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College \u2014 an institution that survives to this day \u2014 to pick select our nation\u2019s leader. In the Electoral College, each state receives as many votes as it has members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. California, our most populous state, gets 55 electoral votes \u2014 more than any other state. Our least-populated states each get 3 electoral votes. The founders rejected direct election of the president by the populace as a whole. They feared demagogues who might flatter and bewitch the people would get elected. But they also did not want Congress to choose the president. The founders believed that the president must remain independent so he could stand up to Congress and not be beholden to lawmakers to stay in office. State legislatures were given the power under the Constitution to choose members of the Electoral College. However, legislatures have delegated that power to voters. So when you cast your ballot in presidential elections you are not actually voting directly for a candidate. You are voting for electors pledged to vote for that candidate. This system represents a compromise that blended a popular voice with the institution of the states to elect the president \u2014 while avoiding Congress altogether. In most states, the legislature has decided that whichever candidate gets the most popular votes gets all the state\u2019s electoral votes. The Constitution also gave state legislatures the exclusive authority to regulate the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.\u201d While Congress can overrule the choices of the state legislatures, state courts cannot. This is a crucial point. State legislatures set the deadlines, define the validity of ballots, and the manner of counting the votes. This system can handle any normal election. But the election this week was no normal election. The COVID-19 pandemic forced some states to adopt large-scale mail-in balloting for the first time. Pennsylvania, for example, had 266,000 mail-in ballots in 2016, but 2.5 million this year. Most states have never mounted such a massive mail-in and counting effort before. Further, America simply cannot make up its mind. Aside from Barack Obama\u2019s two elections, the presidential elections from 2000 on have been so razor-thin that the Electoral College has made all the difference. If President Trump is reelected, he will have won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote for two elections in a row. Gone are the days when television networks and other news organizations could call the presidential election in the early evening because of the projected popular vote alone. In this context, the litigation in Pennsylvania could make all the difference if that state\u2019s 20 electoral votes are needed to determine whether President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election. As I write this, Trump and Biden are within a single point of each other in the popular vote in Pennsylvania. The candidate winning the state\u2019s 20 electoral votes remains undetermined. The mail-in ballots received between Tuesday and Friday this week in Pennsylvania and accepted under the order of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could decide the winner of the presidential race in that state, even if the winner prevails by a very small number of popular votes. This is not unprecedented. In 2000, George W. Bush won Florida, the state\u2019s electoral votes and the presidency by about 500 votes. It is at this point that Trump has a strong case pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. His campaign and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania can challenge the vote in the state on the grounds that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unconstitutionally interfered with the state legislature\u2019s sole authority over the time, place, and manner of federal elections and over the selection of presidential electors. If the U.S. Constitution directly grants those powers to the legislature of Pennsylvania, state courts have no authority to alter state election law for federal office, including the presidency. As a result, the U.S. Supreme Court could strike down the extension of the Pennsylvania deadline to accept ballots until Friday and order the state to reject any ballots that arrived after Election Day on Tuesday. This is not some constitutional flight of fancy. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has already made clear his view that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has violated the U.S. Constitution by allowing mail-in ballots to be accepted until Friday. In an opinion urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accelerate its consideration of the issues raised in the Boockvar case, Alito wrote: \u201cThe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has issued a decree that squarely alters an important statutory provision enacted by the Pennsylvania Legislature pursuant to its authority under the Constitution of the United States to make rules governing the conduct of elections for federal office.\u201d Joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Alito concluded: \u201cThat question has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution.\u201d\u00a0 In a separate case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh adopted the same view. Some critics will argue that the U.S. Supreme Court should defer to state courts in the interpretation of state law. Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted to delay the Boockvar case at the U.S. Supreme Court until after the election, admitted as much in a similar case from Wisconsin, where he agreed to overturn a federal judge\u2019s order to extend the Election Day deadline. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Roberts remains sensitive to political attacks on the U.S. Supreme Court. He probably fears a rerun of Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court stopped recounts in Florida 2000 and sealed George Bush\u2019s victory over Vice President Al Gore in the presidential election that year. Democrats and liberals have attacked the political legitimacy of the Supreme Court ever since. Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, however, could upend Roberts\u2019 carefully laid plans. Barrett had not yet joined the court when Roberts prevented the court from accelerating consideration of Boockvar. The case still remains on the Supreme Court docket, neither rejected nor accepted for review. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If Barrett joins the other four conservative justices, who share her originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, then Roberts could not stop the Supreme Court from intervening in Pennsylvania or from deciding in favor of invalidating all mail-in ballots that came in after Election Day.

Lisa Murkowski said in an interview this week that she \u201cwould not vote\u201d\u00a0to confirm a nominee to the High Court ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Ginsburg\u00a0passed away on Friday at the age of 87 from complications surrounding metastatic pancreas cancer. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG DIES AT 87 Murkowski, R-Alaska, paid tribute to Ginsburg, calling her a \u201ctrue leader and pioneer,\u201d a \u201cchampion and crusader for equal justice and civil liberties,\u201d and said she \u201cmade an enduring mark on history.\u201d \u201cI have the greatest respect for her as a trailblazer among women,\u201d Murkowski said Friday. \u201cI am personally deeply saddened by her passing and know that women around the world who have also admired her tenacity and spirit feel the same.\u201d She added: \u201cTonight we mourn her passing and turn to honoring her life and legacy.\u201d Murkowski\u2019s comments Friday night did not mention a potential path to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court, but just days earlier, the Republican senator, in an interview with Alaska Public Media, said she would not vote for a Supreme Court nominee should a vacancy become available ahead of Election Day. \u201cI would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cWe are 50 some days away from an election.\u201d During the interview, Murkowski based her reasoning on precedent -- noting the situation surrounding former President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee and D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Obama nominated Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away in 2016, but Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination, citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. \u201cThat was too close to an election, and that the people needed to decide,\u201d Murkowski told Alaska Public Media, referencing McConnell\u2019s argument at the time. \u201cThat the closer you get to an election, that argument becomes even more important.\u201d But McConnell, R-Ky., just hours after learning of Ginsburg\u2019s passing, vowed that a President Trump nominee to the Supreme Court to fill her vacancy \u201cwill receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d MCCONNELL: TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 'WILL RECEIVE A VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE' \u201cThe Senate and the nation mourn the sudden passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term. We kept our promise,\u201d McConnell continued. \u201cSince the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.\u201d McConnell added that \u201cby contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary.\u201d \u201cOnce again, we will keep our promise,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d SCHUMER: GINSBURG VACANCY SHOULD NOT BE FILLED UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION But\u00a0the nomination and confirmation\u00a0process for the latest addition to the Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, took 89 days total for confirmation. It took 57 days from Kavanaugh's nomination to his confirmation hearing. There are 45 days until Election Day. Murkowski, during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process, was looked at as one of the final four swing senators who would determine whether the now-justice would be confirmed to the bench of the High Court. Murkowski remained undecided until the final hours prior to the confirmation vote. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was the last Republican senator to throw their support behind Kavanaugh. In an interview with The New York Times earlier this month, Collins indicated that she would be uncomfortable with a vote on a Supreme Court nominee ahead of the election. \u201cI think that\u2019s too close,\u201d she told The Times. \u201cI really do.\u201d In a statement Friday night, Collins did not reference a path forward, but praised Ginsburg as \u201ca trailblazer for women\u2019s rights, a fierce champion for equality, and an extremely accomplished American who broke countless barriers in the field of law.\u201d She added: \u201cShe has been a role model to generations of women, and her legacy will live on in the countless people she inspired.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday said Ginsburg's\u00a0vacancy should not be filled until \"we\u00a0have\u00a0a new president.\u201d \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\u201d Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted Friday. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fox News correspondent Bryan Llenas join 'Outnumbered Overtime' with the latest from Beaver, PA. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if it ends up reviewing a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision to allow the receipt of ballots after Election Day, it will not be until after Nov.\u00a03, effectively\u00a0eliminating one\u00a0factor of the Republicans\u2019 case. In the Pennsylvania GOP\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court seeking\u00a0review, the party\u00a0stated\u00a0that when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled to change how the state would be handling its election, it presented a risk of confusing voters. That argument is known as the Purcell principle, as it comes from 2006\u2019s Purcell v. Gonzalez. SCOTUS WON'T FAST-TRACK APPEAL OVER BLOCKING EXTENDED DEADLINE FOR PA MAIL-IN BALLOTS \u201cCourt orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter\u00a0confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase,\u201d the court said in Purcell. In their petition, Republicans cited Purcell, saying that \u201cit is the Pennsylvania Supreme Court majority\u2019s last-minute upsetting of the rules established by the General Assembly that threatens public \u2018[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes\u2019 on the eve of a historic general election.\u201d Incidentally, Democrats also cited Purcell by claiming that overturning the state court\u2019s ruling so close to the election would cause confusion. John Hansberry, with the Philadelphia City Commissioners office, demonstrates an extraction machine at the city's mail-in ballot sorting and counting center in preparation for the 2020 General Election in the United States, Monday, Oct. 26, 2020, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Justice Brett Kavanaugh used Purcell in a concurring opinion when the Supreme Court decided to restore a South Carolina witness requirement for absentee ballots. Kavanaugh cited precedent that federal courts generally \u201cshould not alter state election rules in the period close to an election.\u201d SUPREME COURT COULD STILL OVERTURN PENNSYLVANIA MAIL-IN BALLOT DEADLINE EXTENSION AFTER ELECTION Since\u00a0voters will have already cast\u00a0their ballots by the time the court weighs in \u2014 if it\u00a0opts to weigh in at all \u2014 Republicans may have to rely on other arguments. They do have options, as their petition showed. One argument is that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court should not be allowed to change the state\u2019s election rules, regardless of timing. The state GOP claimed that because the Constitution says that it is up to state legislatures\u2014not the courts--to determine\u00a0the manner in which they appoint their presidential electors, as well as the \u201cTimes, Places, and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.\u201d Another argument is that federal statutes set out the time for \u201ca single nationwide federal Election Day,\u201d and that states \u201ccannot create a process under which ballots cast or mailed after Election Day can be considered timely.\u201d While pushing the matter off until after the election may have made the Purcell argument moot, Ilya Shapiro, director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, speculated that Chief Justice John Roberts is hoping the whole case will be made moot if the election\u2019s outcome does not rely on Pennsylvania. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cChief Justice John Roberts, who always prefers to kick controversial cans down the road, is clearly hoping that Pennsylvania isn\u2019t the deciding state in the presidential election,\u201d Shapiro told Fox News. Should Pennsylvania be the deciding factor, Shapiro noted, \u201call bets are off\u201d because the court\u2019s recent rulings against the Republicans would not necessarily be indicative of how they would ultimately decide the case.

            "article_content": "Speak Georgia Inc. co-founder Janelle King, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and Fox News contributors Sara Carter weigh in on \u2018The Next Revolution.\u2019 Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court is undeniable proof for even the most cynical among us that elections \u2014\u00a0and every single vote \u2014\u00a0matter. The 2016 election was determined by around 100,000 people in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Even though none of us could have predicted it, those voters in those three states effectively decided the future of the Supreme Court for generations. Barrett is now the third Supreme Court justice added to the bench in less than four years. Now we are less than 2 days away from another consequential election that also could be decided by a few thousand voters, yet millions of evangelical Christians are not planning on participating. This is particularly perplexing since evangelicals could easily determine the outcome of the 2020 election should they choose to participate. Historically, up to 25 million evangelicals who are registered to vote do not participate in presidential elections. DONALD TRUMP: REELECT ME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SAFETY, PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS Why wouldn\u2019t this community of believers use its tremendous voting power to advance their values? Over the years, I have heard several myths that keep many evangelicals from voting. I\u2019m hearing them yet again now that we are just 48 hours away from Nov. 3. Here are the four most common ones and how we should respond to them: 1. Christians shouldn\u2019t be involved in politics. Some evangelicals think engaging in politics requires them to align with a political party and to divorce themselves from their deeply held beliefs. They buy into the belief that their faith and politics do not and cannot mix. To understand this mindset, let\u2019s go back to 1954. That\u2019s when Lyndon B. Johnson created the Johnson Amendment, which states that nonprofit organizations, including churches, cannot endorse a political candidate or advocate for political policies. Thus, many believers think their church must never do or say anything \u201cpolitical,\u201d which has kept the church from speaking into important issues and has kept clergy from encouraging their congregants to vote. JOE BIDEN: I WANT YOUR VOTE TO BECOME YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT \u2014 HERE\u2019S WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU AND OUR NATION But I would submit that our faith has something to offer to the problems we face in our communities. We should consider our vote not simply as a political exercise, but as a spiritual discipline. 2. My vote won\u2019t make a difference. I hear this all the time: \u201cMy one vote doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d This is especially repeated during presidential elections when we have an electoral college and not a majority vote. But this view disregards an essential element of our faith: God can multiply what we offer Him. United, believers can use their influence, resources and their vote to address social inequity, economic disparity and political inconsistencies. Yet, many evangelicals don\u2019t connect their vote with their beliefs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The belief \u201cMy vote won\u2019t make a difference\u201d also ignores the threats to biblical values, such as threats to the individual voter, religious freedom, vulnerable lives, justice and more. By minimizing, ignoring or relabeling these threats, we fail to see how the balance of power could shift to leaders who seek to sideline biblical values, such as religious freedom, or advance agendas against the sanctity of human life. 3. I don\u2019t have enough information. Some people are unaware of election deadlines or feel like they have insufficient information to vote. It\u2019s one thing to know how you will vote for president or for a member of Congress, but it takes time to obtain enough information to vote for candidates for your state legislature, county commissioner, school board, city council, mayor and municipal elections \u2014\u00a0not to mention understanding ballot measures and considering if they align with your beliefs. This is why organizations such as My Faith Votes, where I serve as CEO, have created free voting assistance tools, and other online resources to help Christians learn about elections and candidates in their home state. In an age when information is freely available to all, claiming ignorance is not a valid excuse. 4. None of the candidates represents my values. Some evangelicals argue that because a candidate doesn\u2019t align perfectly with their values or beliefs, then they do not deserve their vote. The truth of the matter is that we will never have a perfect candidate. Some candidates we will like better than others, but we need to remember that we vote for policies, not personalities. I always advise people to forget about the Twitter posts or TV sound bites and look at what a candidate has accomplished or is proposing in his or her campaign platform. Do the policies align with your values and beliefs? Unfortunately, we tend to get distracted by the drama and sensationalism of American politics and forget that a policy can actually impact our communities, businesses and churches. This year, the presidency, 470 seats in Congress, 11 state governorships, 748 state executive seats, 5,000 state legislature seats and over 100,000 local elections are at stake. There are undeniable consequences to these elections. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Evangelical Christians are called to defend life, help the needy, speak up for the oppressed, stand for justice and uphold freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition for all. But when we don\u2019t vote, we allow someone else to make choices for us. Inaction always costs something, and it is usually more than we anticipate.",

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said unequivocally Friday night that President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee to fill the vacancy of late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u201cwill receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d Ginsburg, 87, died Friday from complications surrounding metastatic pancreas cancer. \u201cThe Senate and the nation mourn the sudden passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term.

Circuit Court of Appeals chief Judge Merrick Garland. Obama nominated Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away in 2016, but McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination, citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. Speaking to Fox News last year, McConnell suggested his stance was not hypocritical -- because in 2020, Republicans would control both the White House and the Senate, unlike Democrats in 2016, who controlled only the White House. \"You have to go back to 1880s to find the last time a Senate controlled by a party different from the president filled a vacancy on the Supreme Court that was created in the middle of a presidential election year,\" McConnell told Fox News. FLASHBACK: MCCONNELL VOWS TO FILL A SUPREME COURT VACANCY DURING ELECTION YEAR But\u00a0the nomination and confirmation\u00a0process for the latest addition to the high court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, took 89 days total for confirmation. It took 57 days from Kavanaugh's nomination to his confirmation hearing. There are 45 days until Election Day. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Friday night said Ginsburg\u2019s vacancy should not be filled until \u201cwe have a new president.\u201d \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\u201d Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted Friday. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d There was an active vacancy after the death of Scalia in 2016, but the next presidential term could be even more significant for Supreme Court nominations. Ginsburg\u2019s death leaves a vacancy; and several other justices are over 70, including Justice Stephen Breyer is 82; Clarence Thomas is 72; and Justice Samuel Alito is 70. Meanwhile, President Trump last week\u00a0announced a list of more than 20 people he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court. TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT LIST: POTUS REVEALS LIST OF MORE THAN 20\u00a0PEOPLE HE'D CONSIDER NOMINATING Top contenders, prior to Ginsburg's passing, included Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the\u00a07th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals;\u00a0\u00a0Judge Britt Grant of the\u00a011th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals;\u00a0Judge Amul Thapar of the\u00a0U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit;\u00a0\u00a0Judge Steven Colloton of the\u00a08th Circuit U-S Court of Appeals;\u00a0Judge Allison Eid of the\u00a010th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals;\u00a0\u00a0Judge Raymond Gruender of the\u00a08th Circuit U-S Court of Appeals;\u00a0Judge Thomas Hardiman of the\u00a03rd Circuit U-S Court of Appeals;\u00a0Judge Raymond Kethledge of the\u00a06th Circuit U-S Court of Appeals;\u00a0Judge Joan Larsen of the\u00a06th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals; Judge Barbara Lagoa of the\u00a011th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals;\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas Lee of the\u00a0Utah Supreme Court;\u00a0Judge David Stras of the\u00a08th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals;\u00a0Judge Allison Jones Rushing of the\u00a04th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals; and\u00a0Judge Don Willett of the\u00a05th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, Ginsburg, who passed away late Friday, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, spent more than two decades on the bench, and is survived by her two children Jane Carol and James Steven Ginsburg. Ginsburg battled two forms of cancer in the past, but her health began to take a downturn in December 2018 when she underwent a pulmonary lobectomy after two malignant nodules were discovered in the lower lobe of her left lung. On Jan. 7, 2019, the Court announced she would miss oral arguments that day for the first time since she joined as she continued to recuperate from that surgery.

            "article_content": " As President Trump moves to nominate a candidate to fill the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday, there are a growing number of Democrats\u00a0threatening to implement a radical strategy and pack the Supreme Court if they take control of the White House and the Senate. \u201cIf he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021,\u201d Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., tweeted on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201d MARKEY THREATENS TO PACK SUPREME COURT, ABOLISH FILIBUSTER IF TRUMP FILLS SEAT \u201cMitch McConnell set the precedent. No Supreme Court vacancies filled in an election year. If he violates it, when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court,\u201d Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., tweeted. The idea of \u201cpacking\u201d the court with extra justices --\u00a0attempted unsuccessfully\u00a0by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1937 to force through parts of his New Deal that were\u00a0ruled unconstitutional by the high court --\u00a0has bubbled away on the fringes of the party for years. But it began to seep into the mainstream after Republicans refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland -- President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia -- because it was an election year. Consequently the seat was held open until after the 2017 inauguration of President Trump, who nominated now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. Many Democrats saw the seat as \u201cstolen\u201d as a result. The Garland controversy has been cited by Democrats again now that Republicans are moving to fill Ginsburg's seat\u00a0in an election year. They say that because Republicans refused to fill a seat in 2016, they should decline to fill this one in 2020. Republicans, however, have said that the precedent is when the Senate is controlled by an opposition party to the White House. Other Democrats have said that Democrats should consider court packing if the confirmation is delayed and occurs during a lame-duck session after Nov. 3. BIDEN BUCKS DEM 2020 FIELD ON COURT PACKING, DECRIMINALIZING BORDER CROSSINGS \u201cIf Sen. McConnell and @SenateGOP were to force through a nominee during the lame-duck session -- before a new Senate and President can take office -- then the incoming Senate should immediately move to expand the Supreme Court,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler wrote on Twitter. \u201cFilling the SCOTUS vacancy during a lame-duck session, after the American people have voted for new leadership, is undemocratic and a clear violation of the public trust in elected officials. Congress would have to act and expanding the court would be the right place to start,\u201d the New York Democrat continued. It is unclear if Democratic nominee Joe Biden will back those calls. A number of his primary opponents, including his now-running mate Kamala Harris, signaled their openness last year\u00a0to expanding the number of judges on the court if they enter the White House. Biden, however, said in 2019 he was not prepared to pack the court, \u201cbecause we\u2019ll live to rue that day.\u201d NADLER PROPOSES SENATE EXPAND NUMBER OF SCOTUS JUSTICES IF DEMS WIN ELECTION It remains to be seen if his stance will change given Ginsburg\u2019s death, and what appears to be a shifting mood in the party on the question. Democratic congressional leaders, meanwhile, have not explicitly supported court packing, but have suggested they are open to radical strategies if Republicans fill the seat. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a caucus call with Senate Democrats Saturday that \"nothing is off the table\" if Republicans move forward with confirming a justice immediately. \u201cLet me be clear: if Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans move forward with this, then nothing is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table,\" he said, a source on the call told Fox News.\u00a0He added that \"Everything Americans value is at stake.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not talked about court packing, on Sunday refused to rule out measures such as impeaching the president\u00a0if he moves to fill the seat. \u201cWe have our options. We have arrows in our quiver that I\u2019m not about to discuss right now, but the fact is we have a big challenge in our country,\u201d Pelosi said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week.\u00a0\u201cThis president has threatened to not even accept the results of the election.\u201d Schumer and Pelosi's comments brought rebuke from the White House. \u201cThe Speaker threatened to impeach the President -- again -- for simply fulfilling his constitutional obligation,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern told Fox News.\u00a0\"Numerous Democrats are threatening to pack the court and say things like \u2018nothing is off the table.\u2019 These are bizarre and dangerous power grabs by Democrats who will stop at nothing to erode the Constitution to enact their radical agenda.\" Democrats who would expand the court would also have to acknowledge that they did not have the support from Ginsburg herself -- who warned against court packing last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Nine seems to be a good number. It's been that way for a long time,\" she told NPR. \"I think it was a bad idea when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court.\" \"Well, if\u00a0anything would make the court appear\u00a0partisan, it would be that,\" she said. \"One side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who will vote the way we want them to.'\" Fox News' Brooke Singman and Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.",

RUTH BADER GINSBURG DEATH MAKES SUPREME COURT MAJOR 2020 CAMPAIGN ISSUE \"One of the great joys of\u00a0my life was to be a good bosom\u00a0buddy with Justice Scalia during\u00a0the last 10 years of his life,\" he recounted. \"He once told me that he thought\u00a0her legacy would be more\u00a0profound than his because his\u00a0legacy was based upon\u00a0restraining the court and her\u00a0legacy will be based upon\u00a0unleashing the court and that's\u00a0usually more popular with\u00a0historians. Only time will tell.\" The judge notes that if President Trump nominates someone before Election Day, as it appears, his selection would give the conservative wing of the court a majority, given that Chief Justice John Roberts \"is not a reliable member of that wing.\" \"But this new person, who probably\u00a0will be half of Justice\u00a0Ginsburg's age, better have very\u00a0thick skin because the Democrats\u00a0will do all they can either to\u00a0crush this person or to prevent\u00a0a vote ... until we\u00a0see who wins the election,\" Napolitano said. PICKING RUTH BADER GINSBURG REPLACEMENT WILL BE 'MAJOR PART OF THIS ELECTION': BRET BAIER Both sides of the aisle will be looking very closely at polling in the coming days. \"Do the polls say the people want\u00a0the next president, whether it's\u00a0a reelected Donald Trump or a\u00a0newly elected Joe Biden to\u00a0choose the replacement for Justice Ginsburg or do the polls\u00a0say the people want a nine-member Supreme Court in place\u00a0immediately?\" he asked. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0has repeatedly said that he would move swiftly to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, despite opposing a push by Democrats and former President Barack Obama\u00a0to fill Justice Antonin Scalia's seat after he died in February 2016. McConnell reiterated that pledge on Friday night. With Republicans holding a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, it's unclear if they have the necessary votes to nominate and confirm a new justice.\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has already\u00a0said\u00a0the open seat should not be filled until after the Nov. 3 election. \"Now, all politics is going to be\u00a0who should replace Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg,\" Napolitano said. \"So, if Susan Collins, for example, in Maine thinks that voting for\u00a0President Trump's nominee is\u00a0going to impair her ability to\u00a0get re-elected, she's going\u00a0to vote with the Democrats.\u00a0They only need two or three\u00a0others who feel that way and\u00a0then Mitch McConnell will not have a\u00a0majority\u00a0on the floor.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u00a0could play a large role in the process. Her running mate, Joe Biden, has said the next pick should come after the election, and he has\u00a0promised to pick a\u00a0Black woman. \"In the confirmation\u00a0hearings, if you remember this\u00a0for now-Justice Kavanaugh, the\u00a0single most aggressive opponent\u00a0to him was Senator Kamala\u00a0Harris.\u00a0I don't think she will be that\u00a0aggressive unless the polls tell\u00a0her that this will enhance the\u00a0Biden-Harris ticket,\" Napolitano said.",

            "article_content": "'The stakes are very high,' says Peter Schweizer discussing the role 'judicial activism' will play in replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u00a0has some Republicans arguing that filling\u00a0her seat right away is the only way\u00a0to avoid\u00a0a possible\u00a0\u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d if the presidential election ends up in the courts. Debate over those concerns is escalating as the campaigns of President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u00a0brace\u00a0for the possibility of a protracted legal battle in the event of a contested election result.. TRUMP URGES REPUBLICANS TO FILL GINSBURG VACANCY 'WITHOUT DELAY' Ginsburg\u00a0died from complications related to metastatic cancer of the pancreas. Soon after her\u00a0death was announced, some Republicans said confirming a nominee quickly would avert a potential crisis in which the election comes before the\u00a0high court but justices are deadlocked. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who the president named as a potential Supreme Court nominee earlier this month, said it was \u201ccritical\u201d that the Senate take up and confirm a Trump nominee before Election Day, citing a battle between Republicans and Democrats over the issue of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cDemocrats and Joe Biden have made clear that they intend to challenge this election, they intend to fight the legitimacy of this election,\u201d Cruz said Friday night on \u201cHannity.\u201d Republicans, for their part, warn there is a potential for widespread fraud and confusion\u00a0in November\u2019s election due to the unprecedented scale of mail-in ballots in states across the nation. TED CRUZ WARNS OF 'CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS' ON ELECTION DAY \u201cWe cannot have Election Day come and go with a 4-4 court --\u00a0a 4-4 court that is equally divided cannot decide anything,\u201d Cruz warned. \u201cI think we risk a constitutional crisis if we do not have a 9-justice Supreme Court, particularly when there is such a risk of contested litigation and a contested election.\u201d Cruz warned that if the Ginsburg vacancy is not filled, the legal battle could go on \u201cfor weeks and months.\u201d\u00a0 That is, of course, if there is no clear winner. \u201cWe have a responsibility and a responsibility to do our jobs,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe president should nominate a principled constitutionalist with a proven record and the Senate -- its going to take a lot of work to get it done before Election Day -- but we should do our job and protect the country from the constitutional crisis that could result otherwise.\u201d A senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, Hans Von Spakovsky, backed Cruz\u2019s warning of a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s right about that,\u201d Spakovsky told Fox News, saying that in the event of a 4-4 deadlock, an appeals court ruling would \u201cremain in effect.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a race to the courthouse, with parties trying to file suit in whichever court of appeals circuit they think is most friendly to their side, so that they can hopefully get that court of appeals decision up to the Supreme Court first,\u201d Spakovsky said. MCCONNELL: TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 'WILL RECEIVE A VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE' But another constitutional scholar, who requested anonymity, told Fox News that argument was flawed, noting that a 4-4 deadlocked court would mean that one conservative justice was siding with liberal justices on the matter. \u201cNo matter what, if it is 4-4, that means one of the five Republicans is joining the three remaining Democrats,\u201d the scholar told Fox News. \u201cThey are only looking at the playbook from the last time around, when Justice Scalia died, leaving four Republicans and four Democrats.\u201d Currently, with Ginsburg\u2019s passing, the court has eight justices, with Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, John Roberts\u00a0and Clarence Thomas considered conservative, and Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer\u00a0and Elena Kagan considered liberal. The scholar also told Fox News that the Constitution \u201cmakes the Congress the judge of contested elections,\u201d citing the contested elections of 1800, 1824\u00a0and 1876, when Congress intervened and judged the outcome. He said the Supreme Court \u201cmajorly regretted\u201d intervening in Bush v. Gore in 2000, and predicted that the high court\u00a0would not get involved in litigating a potential 2020 contested election. The scholar did say there is an argument to be made about nominating and confirming a judge to fill Ginsburg\u2019s vacancy ahead of the election, but not because of a crisis. He cited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s promise to voters\u00a0that Republicans would confirm conservative judges\u00a0-- saying that is a legitimate reason to move forward --\u00a0while also warning that some GOP senators in tough re-election battles this November could push back on the timeline. Democrats, including Biden, have called for the next president\u00a0to nominate the next justice. But\u00a0McConnell vowed that a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court to fill her vacancy \u201cwill receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d \u201cIn the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term. We kept our promise,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSince the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.\u201d McConnell added that \u201cby contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary.\u201d \u201cOnce again, we will keep our promise,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d The president has since seized on McConnell\u2019s promise, urging Republicans to swiftly confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court \u201cwithout delay.\u201d Both the Trump and Biden campaigns have built massive legal teams, bracing for the possibility of a protracted legal battle in the event of a contested election. The Biden campaign told Fox News on Monday that over the past several months\u00a0they have created the largest election protection program in presidential campaign history, involving integrated legal, communications and political strategies for what they anticipate to be an unprecedented election. Part of the election protection program includes former Attorney General Eric Holder and hundreds of other lawyers. BIDEN CAMPAIGN LAWYERS UP FOR ELECTION-RELATED COURT BATTLES The strategies, according to the campaign, are being directed to support\u00a0election jurisdictions in preparing for and administering the vote under what they call \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d this cycle, voter education to raise awareness of options for in-person and mail-in voting, aggressive responses to vote suppression activities, and robust programs for identifying and countering foreign interference\u00a0and misinformation from foreign or domestic sources. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, also bracing for the possibility of a protracted legal battle, formed what it has\u00a0called \u201cLawyers for Trump,\u201d a coalition to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of November\u2019s vote. Trump campaign general counsel Matthew Morgan told Fox News earlier this month that the campaign is urging active and retired attorneys, and even law students, to volunteer in their nationwide efforts. TRUMP CAMPAIGN\u00a0BRACING FOR LEGAL BATTLE OVER ELECTION, FORMING 'COALITION' OF LAWYERS \u201cDemocrats are working to shred election integrity measures one state at a time, and there\u2019s no question they\u2019ll continue their shenanigans from now to November and beyond,\u201d Morgan told Fox News. \u201cThe Trump campaign is fighting to ensure every valid ballot across America counts \u2013 once.\u201d The coalition is being led by Texas\u00a0Attorney General Ken Paxton and Arkansas\u00a0Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, as well as California\u00a0Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon and former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino. The group includes prominent Trump-allied attorneys like former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, former Attorney General Ed Meese and\u00a0the president's personal attorney\u00a0Rudy Giuliani.",

            "article_content": " Republican Sen. Richard Burr defended President Trump on Tuesday by saying he has \u201cevery right under the Constitution\u201d to nominate an individual to the Supreme Court vacancy left by late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, adding that he believes the Senate should consider that nominee \u201cas early as possible.\u201d Burr, R-N.C., came out in support of the Senate taking up the president\u2019s eventual nominee as the math is tipping in favor of Trump and Republicans who want to replace Ginsburg with a conservative justice. SCHUMER SAYS MCCONNELL 'DEFILED' THE SENATE AND 'MAY VERY WELL DESTROY IT' OVER SUPREME COURT VACANCIES \u201cThe President has every right under the Constitution to nominate the individual of his choosing to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy,\u201d Burr said in a statement Tuesday. \"The Senate\u2019s role is to provide its advice and consent.\" Burr\u00a0went on to say that, \u201cin this instance, unlike 2016, Americans voted to ensure the Senate and Presidency are both held by the same party.\u201d \u201cI believe the Senate should consider President Trump\u2019s nominee as early as possible and I intend to carefully review their qualifications once that individual is named,\u201d Burr said. Burr\u2019s comments come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Republicans are vowing to give the president\u2019s eventual nominee a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Democrats have been referring to the controversy surrounding the confirmation of former President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals chief Judge Merrick Garland, to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TOP FEMALE JUDGES BEING MENTIONED FOR SCOTUS After the nomination, McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or a vote on Garland\u2019s nomination, at the time\u00a0citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. But McConnell has said that there is no comparison between 2016 and today, saying that in 2020\u00a0Republicans control both the White House and the Senate, unlike\u00a02016, when\u00a0Democrats only controlled the White House. According to McConnell\u2019s office, 15 times in U.S. history, a Supreme Court vacancy has arisen in a presidential election year, and the president has moved to nominate someone to the seat. In seven\u00a0of those 15 times, according to his office, voters put in place an opposite-party Senate. McConnell\u2019s office said that only two\u00a0of those seven\u00a0nominations were confirmed, the last being in 1888. McConnell\u2019s office also pointed to eight\u00a0of those 15 times, voters had chosen a Senate majority of the same party as the president, to which seven\u00a0of those eight\u00a0nominations were confirmed. TRUMP: SUPREME COURT PICK TO BE ANNOUNCED SATURDAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE \u201cThe only such nominee who was not confirmed faced bipartisan opposition over serious questions of judicial ethics and personal finances,\u201d McConnell Communications Director David Popp said. \u201cApart from that strange exception, no Senate has failed to confirm a nominee in the circumstances that face us now.\u201d \u201cThe weight of historical precedent was behind the Senate majority\u2019s decision in 2016 and there is even more overwhelming precedent behind its decision to move forward in 2020,\u201d Popp added. Meanwhile, President Trump said Tuesday that he'll announce his choice for the Supreme Court this Saturday at the White House. At this point, only two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska\u00a0\u2014 have said they oppose moving ahead with a nomination ahead of the election. On Tuesday, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined potential swing vote Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.;\u00a0Joni Ernst, R-Iowa;\u00a0Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa;\u00a0and others in backing the Senate in advancing the eventual Trump nominee. Republicans can lose up to three votes and still be able to confirm a Trump nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence as the tiebreaker.",

Biden, the former vice president, signaled at an ABC News town hall that he'd announce his stance on court-packing after the Senate votes on Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett and\u00a0before the Nov. 3 election. The Democratic presidential nominee reiterated his position from the presidential primaries that \u201cI have not been a fan of court packing\"\u00a0 but reversed course on his previously tight-lipped stance on whether he'd try to expand the number of justices on the court to combat a conservative majority. BIDEN'S COURT-PACKING 180, SAYS HE WILL NOW TELL VOTERS HIS STANCE BEFORE ELECTION Voters \u201cdo have a right to know where I stand,\" Biden said. Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden participates in a town hall with moderator ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2020. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Meanwhile\u00a0on NBC News, Trump faced tough questioning on issues such as\u00a0whether he has a replacement for Obamacare, his handling of the coronavirus and a potential peaceful transfer of power. \"Will you accept the results of the election?\" NBC News' Savannah Guthrie asked\u00a0Trump. \"You're own FBI director says there is no evidence of voter fraud.\" \"Then he's not doing his job,\" Trump said\u00a0\u00a0But \"the answer is yes, I will.\" Guthrie brought\u00a0up a New York Times story about Trump's taxes that said he only paid $750 in taxes in\u00a0both 2016 and 2017 and that he holds $421 million in loans and debts. \"Who do you owe $421 million to?\" \"It's a tiny percentage of my net worth,\" Trump replied. Meanwhile, on ABC, Biden said he doesn't support a ban on fracking or defunding the police and he doesn't see a need for another coronavirus lockdown. But he said\u00a0it's\u00a0\"absolutely\" OK to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations during a weak economy because his economic plan would spur growth and create jobs. He stressed that he would only repeal the Trump tax cuts on the highest income earners. \"About $1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in [Trump's]\u00a0tax cuts went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent,\" Biden said. \"That's what I'm talking about eliminating, not all the tax cuts that are out there.\" In one exchange, a young Black man asked Biden about his comments to\u00a0Charlamagne tha God that \"you ain't Black\" if you don't vote for him. \"Besides 'you ain't Black'\u00a0what do you have to say to young black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to not protect them?\" the audience member asked. BIDEN PRESSED ON 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' COMMENT DURING TOWN HALL Biden encouraged the young man to vote and then offered a long-winded response on his record on\u00a0criminal justice reform, education and entrepreneurship that host George Stephanopoulos had\u00a0to cut off. \"Did you hear what you needed to hear?\" Stephanopoulos asked the young man. \"I think so,\" he replied. Then Biden chimed in again and started talking about a story of his dad losing his job in Scranton. \"If you're going to hang out afterwards I'll tell you more,\" Biden told him as\u00a0Stephanopoulos\u00a0tried to move on to the next questioner. BIDEN SAID IT'S 'ABSOLUTELY' OK TO RAISE TAXES DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN The Trump town hall was shorter than Biden's but doubly more combative. Trump kicked off the combative tone with a tweet announcing his town hall with\u00a0\"fake\" NBC News and questioning whether he would be treated as well as \"Sleepy Joe.\" The town hall started off with a 20-minute grilling by Guthrie on coronavirus, QAnon and white supremacy before getting to audience questions. Guthrie asked Trump on why he was hesitant to denounce white supremacy during the first presidential debate and Trump complained that\u00a0NBC won't ask\u00a0Biden if he denounces Antifa and said the former vice president is treated like \"a child\" by the press. \"Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy,\" Trump told Guthrie.\u00a0\"What\u2019s your next question?\" TRUMP DENOUNCES WHITE SUPREMACY, SAYS HE WILL ACCEPT A 'PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER' BUT WANTS 'TO WIN' \"It feels sometimes you\u2019re hesitant to do so,\" Guthrie responded. \"Hesitant? Here we go again,\" Trump lamented. President Donald Trump speaks during an NBC News Town Hall, at Perez Art Museum Miami, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2020, in Miami. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) In contrast, the\u00a0Biden town hall was a more cordial affair. Neither Stephanopoulos nor the audience members asked Biden anything about his son, Hunter, and the bombshell New York Post reporting on emails that purport to link him to Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine. The event ended with Stephanopoulos thanking Biden and audience members for asking good questions. \"I think you did a service to our democracy\u00a0tonight,\" the news anchor said. The competing town halls\u00a0were the fallout of a scrapped second debate that was long scheduled for Thursday night. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis and the outbreak at the White House prompted the Commission on Presidential\u00a0Debates to cancel an in-person event in favor of a virtual format. But the Trump campaign wasn't on board with an online format and the Biden campaign didn't agree to a date change, so the debate eventually was canceled altogether. TRUMP SAYS HE KNOWS 'NOTHING' ABOUT QANON WHEN PRESSED BY NBC ANCHOR The second debate was already marred by controversy when the scheduled\u00a0moderator, C-SPAN's Steve Scully, admitted he lied that his Twitter account was hacked after a message to a former Trump\u00a0aide-turned-adversary Anthony Scaramucci emerged before the now-canceled event. As of now, the final in-person debate between Trump and Biden is still set\u00a0for Oct. 22 in Nashville. \"I expect to be there,\" Biden said, while making a point on the importance of testing. Trump was pressed\u00a0on whether he tested negative for coronavirus before the initial presidential debate between the two on Sept. 29, a requirement of the debate commission. The White House hasn't been clear on Trump's testing schedule before his infection was made public on Oct. 2\u00a0and Trump was cagey on whether he was tested on the day of the debate. \"It was afterwards,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, I don't even remember. I test all the time but I can tell you this, after the debate, like I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That's when I first found out about it.\" In one moment of levity at the Trump event, one woman questioner gushed about Trump's looks. \"Good evening, Mr. President. I have to say you have a great smile,\u201d Paulette Dale said, beaming with a big grin. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cYou\u2019re so handsome when you smile,\u201d she added.

The U.S. Sixth Circuit\u00a0Court of Appeals ruled Monday that first-time Tennessee voters don't need to cast a ballot in person on Election Day and should be given access to absentee options. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons issued the ruling and claimed\u00a0that \"given the expected increase in absentee voting in the November 2020 election due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased interest in the state\u2019s absentee-voting procedures,\" according to court documents obtained by Fox News. She went on to say the plaintiffs\u2019 claim challenged\u00a0a restriction on first-time voters\u2019 ability to vote absentee. A\u00a0district court had already granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the restriction on first-time voters violated the Constitution.

In this instance, there is no substantial harm to defendants in continuing to comply with rules they are currently following.\" Gibbons added:\u00a0\"Considering that both plaintiffs and defendants have widely publicized the district court\u2019s order in this case and that voting is well underway in Tennessee, a stay of the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction at this point would substantially injure the plaintiffs and is not in the public\u2019s best interest.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She also said the defendant's appeal will be heard under the \"agreed-upon timeline,\" previously submitted to the court.",

Biden has repeatedly declined to reveal whether he would support efforts to expand the court. Among likely voters, 58% said Democrats should not look to increase the size of the Supreme Court, according to the results of a poll conducted from Oct.15-18 by the New York Times and Siena College. Just 31% said they were in favor of court-packing, while 11% of responders were undecided.

Among registered Republicans, just 6%\u00a0support an expansion of the Supreme Court, while 89% were against the concept. The joint New York Times-Siena College poll was conducted through telephone interviews with 987 likely voters. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

            "article_content": "Former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker weighs in. A federal judge ruled earlier this week to extend the cutoff to count absentee ballots by six days after the election, but the decision is being appealed by the\u00a0GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature and is expected to make its way all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. District Judge William Conley's decision came Monday after Democrats argued that an extension was needed to accommodate for the influx of voters requesting mail-in ballots, and allow them time to both receive and send back their votes just five weeks before the election. Republicans have said there is more than enough time for absentee voters to arrange for their ballots to be submitted by the original cutoff of 8 p.m. on Election Day, and Wisconsin's GOP leaders said Wednesday\u00a0they plan to ask the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to put the ruling on hold pending appeal. WISCONSIN AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATE TRAYS OF MAIL, ABSENTEE BALLOTS FOUND IN DITCH Conley's ruling\u00a0mirrored a similar extension he granted during April's presidential primaries, when\u00a0nearly\u00a07% of all ballots cast were returned the week after polls closed. The uptick in absentee voting is partly attributable to the coronavirus pandemic but comes at a time when the USPS has faced backlash about slowed mail deliveries and shoddy service that has left thousands of ballots undelivered in this year's primaries. While more than 1 million absentee ballots have been requested to date, the Wisconsin Elections Commission anticipates as many as 2 million will eventually be cast. That would be three times more than any other previous election, which threatens to overwhelm election officials, Conley said. The U.S. Postal Service will also \u201cundoubtedly be overwhelmed again with ballots in November, as they were in April,\u201d Conley wrote. Conley, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, also agreed with Democrats to lift the Oct. 14 deadline for by-mail and electronic voter registration. The judge extended it until Oct. 21. Conley further ruled that poll workers can work in any county, not just in the one they live. Clerks have reported a shortage of poll workers due to the pandemic, and loosening the residency rules could make it easier to fill slots. The state's Election Commission has urged voters to request and submit their ballots as soon as possible to avoid being eliminated from the count come Nov.\u00a03.

The filing by the state Democratic Party on Thursday was in response to a motion by the Trump campaign to join the state GOP in its effort to overturn the deadline extension, which was implemented by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Republicans argue that the state supreme court overstepped its authority because the U.S. Constitution gives the power to set up state election law to state legislatures. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, in a statement last week backed the Supreme Court's refusal\u00a0to take up the case, saying there was not enough time to issue a ruling before the election. But they left the door open to decide the case post-election and said it is \"likely\" the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling is unconstitutional. Pennsylvania Democrats Brie... by Fox News WHERE THE RACE STANDS: BIDEN ERASES TRUMP LEAD IN GEORGIA AND PENNSYLVANIA, NEARS 270 ELECTORAL VOTES \"There is no reason for the Court to expedite consideration of the pending petitions, let alone to grant certiorari at this time,\" the Pennsylvania Democratic Party said in its brief, urging the justices to exercise further patience. \"Because this Court may well not need to hear and decide these cases, it would be premature for this Court to rule on the motion to intervene,\" the state party also said. As of Friday morning, Joe Biden leads in states like Georgia and Nevada, putting into question whether or not Pennsylvania would become unnecessary on the\u00a0path to 270 electoral votes --\u00a0the number needed to win the presidency. And as Biden took a lead in the Pennsylvania vote count Friday, either he or Trump may end up winning the election in that state by a margin higher than the number of post-Election Day ballots that are even received, something the state Democratic Party acknowledged in its brief. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Even if there were a legal basis for refusing to count any such ballots (and there is not), no reason exists to assume that the number of ballots received in that window would be large enough to be decisive in the races for President and House of Representatives,\" the party said. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party did not oppose allowing the Trump campaign to join the suit. Meanwhile, the office of Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar argued against letting the Trump campaign join the suit by state Republicans. Whether or not the Trump campaign can join the suit is unlikely to affect the outcome, though the Trump campaign is touting its efforts to join the state Republicans as part of its public relations strategy promoting some post-election lawsuits it's filed.

The former NASA astronaut told KTAR News\u00a092.3 FM\u2019s Gaydos and Chad that a nomination shouldn't be made so close to Election Day, although President Trump has already done so. Trump\u00a0announced his selection of conservative\u00a0Seventh\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Saturday, sparking an outcry from Democrats after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a leader of the court's liberal wing. Senate Republicans have promised a vote on Barrett, whose appointment would cement a conservative majority on the court,\u00a0despite refusing to consider a nomination from President Obama nine months before the 2016 election. Kelly stopped short of saying whether he'd vote against Barrett if he were to win his special election and start his term early. Such a vote has been the subject of widespread speculation since it could narrow the path to approval for an already narrow Republican majority.

            "article_content": "The Trump campaign files lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia; reaction and analysis from constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley.&nbsp; As expected, the 2020 presidential campaign season has evolved into a post-election battle consisting of legal challenges in crucial battleground states\u00a0as President Trump's campaign attempts to prevent the counting of ballots they allege are or could be invalid. With several states still too close to call as of early Thursday morning, the Trump campaign has lawsuits filed in Georgia, Pennsylvania\u00a0and Michigan, and is seeking a recount in Wisconsin. It's also announced a lawsuit in Nevada Thursday morning. Pennsylvania courts have already weighed in, handing Republicans at least one win and leaving the potential for another. WHEN WILL WE KNOW WHO WON THE ELECTION? Here is a breakdown of what is\u00a0happening with the lawsuits in those states. Pennsylvania The Trump campaign\u00a0launched a multipronged attack in Pennsylvania, alleging various procedural violations. An appellate court in the state handed the Trump campaign a win Thursday by allowing elections watchers to stand as close as six feet away from vote counters to ensure a fair process in Philadelphia. Still, the Trump campaign alleged that \"Democrat\" elections workers were blocking their access to vote counting. \"On the heels of this ruling, Democrats are blatantly defying the law. These Democrats are blocking the doors to the counting center and pushing our observers outside the building while they continue to count votes inside with zero transparency. What are they hiding?\"\u00a0Trump campaign attorney Justin Clark said in a statement. A federal judge denied the campaign's request to stop the vote in Philadelphia over observer access, instead urging the sides to forge an agreement. Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Paul Diamond scheduled an emergency hearing over the suit, before pushing the parties to reach agreement during recess, then ruling that each side could have 60 observers in the vote-counting room\u00a0\u00a0as long as they could follow social distancing and must stay behind a barrier. The campaign filed an emergency injunction to stop the vote count Thursday afternoon on the grounds of alleged Due Process violations, accusing the County Board of Elections of \"intentionally refusing to allow any representatives and poll watchers for President Trump and the Republican Party\" while they continue to count votes. Earlier, Clark said\u00a0the campaign had sued to stop elections officials in Pennsylvania from what they characterize as \"hiding the ballot counting and processing from our Republican poll observers.\" Clark said that in Philadelphia and elsewhere\u00a0elections officials had forced their elections watchers to stand 25-plus feet away to observe the counting process. BIDEN-HARRIS TRANSITION TEAM WEBSITE GOES LIVE EVEN AS ELECTION REMAINS UNDECIDED The Trump campaign is also asking the court to stop allowing voters to provide late missing proof of identification on Nov. 9, rather than the 12. On Thursday a\u00a0judge ordered the county boards of elections to segregate ballots for which ID was validated by Nov. 9 and ballots with valid IDs between Nov. 9 and 12. The segregated ballots \u201cshall not be counted until further order of this court.\u201d The court hasn't decided the underlying issue: how long to allow for absentee and mail-in voters to provide identification. But, they're asking PA to make sure the small subset of ballots at issue in the case are segregated from the rest. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed Wednesday was against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and 67 county election boards, claiming a guidance letter from Boockfar sent out Nov. 1\u00a0\u201cre-writes the Election Code\u201d by \u201cresetting the deadline for absentee and mail-in voters to provide missing proof of identification\u201d to the sixth day after the end of canvassing, which is Nov.\u00a012. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Election Code says the deadline is \u201cthe sixth day following the election,\u201d which the campaign notes is Nov.\u00a09. People who do not provide proof of identification in time are to have their ballots discarded. The campaign argues Boockvar is\u00a0\u201ccontradicting the Election Code\u201d with the last-minute change.\u00a0\u201cThis new flagrant attack on the legislature\u2019s authority was sent to every county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cIf Secretary Boockvar\u2019s guidance is allowed to continue, it will undoubtedly create a high risk of jeopardizing the integrity of the November 3, 2020 General Election by allowing for the counting and canvassing of absentee and mail-in ballots who fail to provide by November 9, 2020, the requisite proof of identification, as mandated by the General Assembly,\u201d the lawsuit says. CLICK HERE TO SEE FOX NEWS\u2019 LIVE PROBABILITY DIALS Boockvar said during a Wednesday news conference that she would not comment on any active litigation. Typically there would be no difference in the two dates, but for 2020 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court allowed absentee votes to be received for an extra three days in a decision that Republicans are looking to challenge before the U.S. Supreme Court. That challenge was brought to the high court prior to the election by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. The GOP\u00a0had sought to have the state Supreme Court\u2019s decision thrown out before the election, which would have reinstated the state\u2019s Election Day deadline for receiving absentee ballots. The Supreme Court denied a request to block the state court\u2019s ruling for the duration of the case\u00a0and then denied a subsequent case to decide the case on the merits before the election. As a result, mail-in ballots received by Nov. 6 will be counted barring evidence that they were mailed after Election Day, but those votes will be segregated pending any court ruling. The Trump campaign is now requesting to be added as a party in that case. \u201cAs the real party in interest, Movant has a direct, concrete stake in the outcome of these petitions and, ultimately, the lawfulness of Pennsylvania\u2019s vote tally,\u201d the campaign said in a court filing, in which it claimed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling \u201cviolates federal law.\u201d Georgia The Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed a lawsuit Wednesday alleging that in Chatham County\u00a0absentee ballots that arrived after the Nov.\u00a03, 7 p.m. deadline may have been counted. A poll watcher claimed that a stack of unprocessed ballots appeared to be mixed in with properly cast and processed ballots\u00a0and that when he asked for information\u00a0he was denied. \u201cDespite attempts by the poll watcher to obtain information from the [Chatham County Board of Elections] regarding the source of the absentee ballots in mixed into other, already-processed absentee ballots being tabulated in Chatham County, no information to confirm the source of such absentee ballots was provided to the poll watcher,\u201d the complaint states. That poll watcher, Sean Pumphrey, said in a sworn affidavit that he saw a poll worker bring a stack of ballots out from a back room and place them on a table near bins of ballots that he believed had been properly processed. Not long after, he said, that stack of ballots was no longer on the table, and when he asked another poll worker what happened to them, \u201cshe became agitated, removed her COVID mask, stated the ballots were \u2018not on the manifest\u2019 and had to be individually processed and entered into the computer.\u201d She also told him that those ballots had been added to the other ballots and sent off to the county board of elections annex. The lawsuit states that it is unknown to them when that stack of ballots had arrived. The Trump campaign is looking for the court to order county officials to secure and set aside all absentee ballots that come in after the deadline and provide a list of those voters\u2019 names. Michigan While the Fox News Decision Desk has projected Michigan for Joe Biden, not all votes have been tallied and the Trump campaign sued Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, claiming a lack of transparency in the vote-counting process. The complaint says that the state\u2019s absent voter counting boards violated state law by not allowing poll challenger Eric Ostergren from being present for the counting in Oakland County. The relevant state law says that \u201c[a]t all times, at least 1 election inspector from each major political party must be present at the absent voter counting place and the policies and procedures adopted by the secretary of state regarding the counting of absent voter ballots must be followed.\u201d HOW CONGRESS CERTIFIES WHO IS PRESIDENT -- REGARDLESS OF POTENTIAL LEGAL CHALLENGES The complaint also cites a law that requires ballot boxes to be monitored by video surveillance, alleging that challengers were not permitted to view the video. The Trump campaign asked the court to have the ballots cast in \u201cremote and unattended ballot drop boxes\u201d to be set aside and remain uncounted until the video can be viewed. That law only applies to boxes installed on or after Oct.\u00a01\u00a0and does not specify whether election challengers are entitled to view the video. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law,\u201d Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. \u201cWe have filed suit today in the Michigan Court of Claims to halt counting until meaningful access has been granted. We also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access. President Trump is committed to ensuring that all legal votes are counted in Michigan and everywhere else.\u201d The Michigan Attorney General's office said in a statement that the Trump campaign's claims \"are without merit and we will respond accordingly in court.\" In addition to those lawsuits, former Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell is scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday morning to announce a new lawsuit from the Trump campaign in Nevada, where they are claiming that at least 10,000 people voted there despite no longer living in the state. Ilya Shapiro,\u00a0director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, noted that all of these legal matters would have to be resolved relatively quickly, comparing the situation to the legal battle surrounding the 2000 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s a replay of Bush v. Gore, really,\" Shapiro told \"Fox & Friends\"\u00a0on Thursday. \"The states have to certify their electors by Dec.\u00a08 and the Electoral College meets Dec.\u00a014. So the briefing and argument will be held before then.\" This is all on top of a possible recount in Wisconsin. State law only permits a candidate to request a recount if the difference between them and the leading candidate is 1% or less. As of early Thursday, Trump trailed\u00a0Biden by 0.7% with 99% reporting. PRESIDENTIAL RACE UNDECIDED: WHERE THINGS STAND IN UNCALLED BATTLEGROUNDS AS BIDEN WINS MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN The Biden campaign cried hypocrisy over Trump's desire for a recount. \"When Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 by roughly the same amount of votes that Joe Biden just did, or won Michigan with fewer votes than Joe Biden is winning it now, he bragged about a 'landslide,' and called recount efforts 'sad,'\" Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News.\u00a0\"What makes these charades especially pathetic is that\u00a0while Trump is demanding recounts in places he has already lost, he's simultaneously engaged in fruitless attempts to halt the counting of votes in other states in which he's on the road to defeat.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Shapiro said once any recounts are completed, \"then we\u2019ll see if there are any systemic allegations of fraud or anything else,\" noting that\u00a0\"you have to have a legal theory\"\u00a0to have an effective challenge. \"It\u2019s not just what they filed in Michigan to stop the counting temporarily to get access or something like that,\" Shapiro said. \"That\u2019s not a real claim that something\u2019s invalid.\" Ronn Blitzer is an editor for Fox News Digital covering politics and breaking news.",

Sign up\u00a0here.**On the roster: Supreme Court may be the sleeper issue for 2020 -\u00a0CDC won\u2019t hit target for school reopening rules - Senate GOP wants corona lawsuits to go to feds - Ohio swings back to the center of presidential politics -\u00a0Fox goes after WaPo\nSUPREME COURT MAY BE THE SLEEPER ISSUE FOR 2020How big of an issue is the Supreme Court for the 2020 presidential election and which side would be most advantaged if it becomes a bigger one?It looks like we are getting ready to find out. A very busy season for controversial high-court decisions is now followed by news that\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the most famous, oldest and second-longest serving justice has suffered a recurrence of cancer, this time in her liver.The 87-year-old liberal icon says that she will not step aside and will continue to work as she goes through a new round of chemotherapy. She has in the past been treated for colorectal, pancreatic and lung cancers and through a spokeswoman says she is keeping up an \u201cactive daily routine.\u201dSupreme Court speculation has already been pretty frothy in Washington, including now-dispelled speculation that the court\u2019s longest serving member,\u00a0Clarence Thomas, might step down while assured of a Republican appointee being confirmed. Then there was the rumor of the threat that\u00a0Samuel Alito, seething over the Roberts-Gorsuch Western swing dance on social issues, would quit the court in a fit of pique.Thomas is at his post and even seemingly invigorated by the new atmosphere on the court and Alito is no one to surrender. But there are always Supreme Court rumors here and election years predictably produce bumper crops. That\u2019s especially true in the wake of\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0boosting the GOP in 2016 by turfing\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of\u00a0Merrick Garland.The Supremes certainly added to the drama with a slew of decisions that outraged and gratified various activists on issues including presidential immunity, abortion restrictions, religious liberty, gay rights and more. Both Republican- and Democratic-leaning activists found plenty to be alternately upset and happy about as the\u00a0John Roberts\u00a0chiefdom started to come into its fullest flowering.With all that scenery set, word that Ginsberg is again struggling with her health set off today a fresh round of speculation heating up telephones and text screens.Even assuming that Ginsberg remains her unsinkable self until past Election Day \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t after all she\u2019s overcome heretofore \u2013 keen members the Blue Team and the Red Team both see this as another intensifier in what may be the sleeper issue of 2020: The battle for the Supreme Court.The orthodox view among Republican politicos is that conservative voters care more about the Supreme Court than liberal voters. The preservation of the seat held by Ginsberg\u2019s longtime conservative counterpart,\u00a0Antonin Scalia, for now-Justice\u00a0Neil Gorsuch\u00a0is considered a key component of the GOP issue set that allowed the Red Team to carry the suburbs in 2016.Affluent Republican-leaners who were skeptical of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s capacity to serve as president in a competent, honorable way were confronted with the certainty that\u00a0Hillary Clinton, a liberal legal activist herself, would remake the courts in the same way Trump has ended up doing for the other side. One could argue that Trump\u2019s vow to allow the Federalist Society to limit his pool of potential nominees was his single most important campaign promise.Ergo, the more attention on the court and the greater perceived chances of a vacancy would benefit Republicans who could find lots from the Senate Judiciary Committee service of\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0to convince voters that he would be a radical counteraction of Trump\u2019s project of packing the courts with young conservatives.And given the anger among Republican social conservatives about decisions (or non-decisions) on gay rights, abortion and gun control, there\u2019s less chance of right wingers becoming complacent.Democrats, though, would argue that the times have changed.They would point to the intense resentment over both the Garland blockade and the confirmation of Justice\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh. Those twin defeats did prove to be fundraising bonanzas for the Blue Team and provide the grist needed to keep partisans angry and engaged.More importantly, though, Ginsberg is not Scalia. She is, in fact, his equivalent for the Democratic side. She has been lionized in films, books, daily news coverage and across pop culture as \u201cthe notorious RBG.\u201d Whenever she does step down, even if that\u2019s still far off, it will be a major turf war. This isn\u2019t replacing a swing-voting, little-seen justice. This is a heroine of the American Left.Given how much Trump talks about his judicial appointments, Biden should have considerable leeway in talking about his own potential picks. There\u2019s hardly a sense that we are currently at risk of capsizing into a sea of liberal judicial activism \u2013 an attitude that was prevalent as recently as the Obama-era appointment fights. If persuadable voters get Trump\u2019s message about conquering the courts, they will startle less easily at the idea of giving Biden a pick or two.Republicans in recent years have proven that they are better at obtaining political advantage from court appointments. Democrats believe that their time to reverse that trend is now.As the final stretch of the race for the presidency and for control of the Senate shapes up, we\u2019re going to find out who is right.THE RULEBOOK: GUNS AND BUTTER\u201cThe truth is, that the existence of a federal government and military establishments under State authority are not less at variance with each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system of quotas and requisitions.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 25TIME OUT: HOMEYGarden&Gun: \u201cLike most of us during the pandemic,\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0has been doing the best she can.

Instead, the full set will be published before the end of the month, a CDC spokesperson says. \u2018These science and evidence-based resources and tools will provide additional information for administrators, teachers and staff, parents, caregivers and guardians, as together we work towards the public health-oriented goal of safely opening schools this fall,\u2019 the spokesperson said.\u00a0President Trump\u00a0has emphasized that he wants to see schools reopen their classrooms in the fall, but many teachers and parents have balked, concerned that children would spread the virus and get sick themselves. Trump complained on Twitter that the CDC's existing guidance was \u2018too tough.\u2019\u201dMeadows keeps up Team Trump attacks on Fauci - Bloomberg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff criticized\u00a0Anthony Fauci\u00a0for comparing the current coronavirus outbreak to the 1918 flu pandemic, after reprimanding another top White House adviser for publicly attacking Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert. \u2018He suggested that this virus was worse than, or as bad as, the 1918 flu epidemic,\u2019 Mark Meadows\u00a0said during a Fox News interview Thursday. \u2018I can tell you that not only is that false, it\u2019s irresponsible to suggest so.\u2019 Fauci said Tuesday at an event sponsored by Georgetown University that the coronavirus is a \u2018pandemic of historic proportions\u2019 and \u2018when history looks back on it, will be comparable to what we saw in 1918,\u2019 when influenza killed tens of millions of people worldwide. Covid-19 has so far killed more than 588,000 people worldwide, and more than 138,000 in the U.S., according to statistics compiled by Bloomberg.\u201dPoll: Trump still dropping on handing of pandemic - ABC News: \u201cWith COVID-19 cases soaring nationally, Americans by nearly a two to one margin distrust what President Donald Trump says about the pandemic, and six in 10 in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll disapprove of how he\u2019s handling it, up steeply since the early days of the outbreak. Just 38% in the national survey now approve of Trump\u2019s response, down from 46% in late May and a narrow majority, 51%, in late March, a 13-point drop. Disapproval gained 15% in the same period, to 60%. Among Trump\u2019s challenges is his credibility on the issue in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates. Only 34% of Americans place a great deal or good amount of trust in what he says about COVID-19, while 64% trust him not so much or \u2013 in the case of nearly half the public \u2013 not at all. There\u2019s also a disconnect in terms of priorities, with Americans, by 63-33%, saying it\u2019s more important to control the spread of the virus than to restart the economy, a goal Trump has stressed. That 30-point preference for controlling the spread has widened from 20 points in late May.\u201dKemp sues to prevent mask mandate -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cGeorgia Gov.\u00a0Brian Kemp\u00a0is suing Atlanta to block the city from enforcing its mandate to wear a mask in public and other rules related to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying in a court filing that the city's leadership was illegally circumventing state executive orders with their own edicts. Kemp and Georgia Attorney General\u00a0Chris Carr, in a suit filed in state court late Thursday, argued that Atlanta Mayor\u00a0Keisha Lance Bottoms\u00a0has overstepped her authority and must obey Kemp's executive orders under state law. Kemp \u2018seeks to have this Court make a declaration that Mayor Bottoms' executive orders are more restrictive and contradictory to his executive orders, and therefore, Mayor Bottoms' COVID-related executive orders are suspended,\u2019 the lawsuit states.\u201dSENATE GOP WANTS CORONA LAWSUITS TO GO TO FEDSWSJ: \u201cTop Senate Republicans are pushing to give federal courts jurisdiction over personal injury and medical liability claims stemming from the coronavirus pandemic as part of a temporary set of legal protections for businesses, schools and other organizations. Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0(R., Ky.) and Sen.\u00a0John Cornyn\u00a0(R., Texas) crafted the measure ahead of negotiations with Democrats over the next round of coronavirus legislation. The proposal, which the White House is reviewing, temporarily offers schools,\u00a0businesses, health-care providers and nonprofit organizations legal protections when people allegedly exposed to the coronavirus sue them... Under the proposal, defendants in those cases would only be held liable if they didn\u2019t make reasonable efforts to comply with public-health guidelines and instead demonstrated gross negligence or intentional misconduct, according to the summary. The defendants would have the right to move the case to federal court if they so choose, offering a potentially more favorable alternative to state courts.\u201dWhite House says Social Security tax cut a \u2018must\u2019 -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cThe White House is insisting that Congress include a payroll tax cut as part of the next coronavirus stimulus package, potentially complicating talks with lawmakers by pushing a measure that President Trump has tried but failed to advance for almost a year. \u2018As he has done since the beginning of this pandemic, President Trump wants to provide relief to hardworking Americans who have been impacted by this virus and one way of doing that is with a payroll tax holiday,\u2019 White House spokesman\u00a0Judd Deere\u00a0said in a statement. \u2018He\u2019s called on Congress to pass this before and he believes it must be part of any phase four package.\u2019 Trump\u2019s renewed push for a payroll tax holiday comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) prepares to unveil legislation next week that he hopes will launch negotiations on the next major coronavirus bill.\u201dPelosi boasts that she\u2019ll flip \u2018em -\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201cHouse Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0said she\u2019s confident Congress can pass another virus relief plan in the coming weeks and that the GOP will ultimately agree to spending levels closer to the $3.5 trillion proposed by Democrats. \u2018I have no doubt they\u2019ll come around,\u2019 she said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. She said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have moved from questioning whether another stimulus is necessary to agreeing that at least $1 trillion more in relief is needed. Democrats and Republicans are set to begin negotiations on another stimulus plan as soon as next week as the coronavirus continues to rage across the country, forcing renewed business shutdowns that are hobbling the U.S. economy. The number of Americans filing for unemployment barely declined last week in a sign that challenges to any recovery continue to multiply.\u201dOHIO SWINGS BACK TO THE CENTER OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICSNYT: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that Ohio was looking like a lost cause for Democrats, after Donald J. Trump scored a convincing victory there and humiliated the party that had twice carried the state under\u00a0Barack Obama. Now, unexpectedly, Ohio looms as a tantalizing opportunity for\u00a0Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u00a0Two prominent polls of the state last month showed the presidential race in a statistical tie. Turnout in the Ohio primary elections in April was higher for Democrats than Republicans for the first time in a dozen years, evidence of enthusiasm in the Democratic base. And the Trump campaign recently booked $18.4 million in fall TV ads in Ohio, more than in any state besides Florida \u2014 a sign that Mr. Trump is on the defensive in a state that until recently seemed locked down for Republicans. With Democratic leaders urging Mr. Biden, the presumptive nominee, to expand his ambitions to states previously considered out of reach, Ohio offers Democrats the possibility of seizing on suburban gains they have made in the Trump era, while restoring parts of the old Obama coalition.\u201dNever Trump groups target Buckeye State -\u00a0The Columbus Dispatch: \u201cRepublicans working against President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign are targeting Ohio with their latest rebuke of the president. The Lincoln Project super-PAC is aligning with another group, Republican Voters Against Trump, for what they are calling \u2018Operation Grant,\u2019 a nod to Ohio native\u00a0Ulysses S. Grant. That alliance\u2019s plan kicks off with a Lincoln Project advertisement attacking Trump\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic that will air on broadcast and cable television from Friday through Monday in Columbus, Cleveland, Akron and Canton. Republican Voters Against Trump is planning its own ad for the Cincinnati market. Their efforts also will include a ground campaign that has had to move onto the web during the pandemic, said\u00a0John Weaver, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project and former top political adviser to Gov.\u00a0John Kasich. Weaver said the groups have 20,000 volunteers in Ohio and are planning a town hall meeting for next week.\u201dTrump campaign lawyer appears on Kremlin-backed TV -\u00a0Daily Beast: \u201cA top Trump campaign adviser recently appeared on the Russian-government funded TV network RT, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said plays a role in the Kremlin\u2019s plans to undermine American democracy. Trump campaign senior legal adviser\u00a0Jenna Ellis\u2019 appearance on RT\u2019s The\u00a0Alex Salmond\u00a0Show aired on July 9. She appears to be the first Trump campaign official to go on the Russian-funded network since the 2016 election. During her interview, Ellis defended Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and bashed the American media as \u2018propagandist activist media.\u2019\u201dDNC DELEGATES OFF THE HOOK, TOLD TO AVOID MILWAUKEENYT: \u201cDemocratic officials have instructed senators, members of Congress and party delegates not to physically attend their national convention this summer, a sign of the ever-shrinking aspirations for their big campaign event in the face of a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States. The directive, issued Thursday, ensures that little will happen at the convention site in Milwaukee beyond speeches from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his vice-presidential nominee and a handful of other top party leaders. The remainder of the events \u2014 state delegation meetings, parties, voting on the party platform and on Mr. Biden\u2019s nomination \u2014 will happen virtually or not at all. \u2018We have been working closely with state and local public health officials, as well epidemiologists, and have come to the hard decision that members of Congress should not plan to travel to Milwaukee,\u2019\u00a0Chasseny Lewis, a senior adviser to the convention committee, wrote in an email to congressional aides. \u2018No delegates will travel to Milwaukee, and Caucus and Council meetings will take place virtually.\u2019\u201dBiden cuts Trump cash advantage by $100 million -\u00a0Politico: \u201cJoe Biden has nearly closed the once-yawning cash gap between him and President Donald Trump, with big donors flooding his campaign and the Democratic National Committee with money in recent months. Trump and the Republican National Committee have spent years building a formidable war chest, starting soon after he was elected and continuing as Democrats burned money in their own primary in 2019 and early 2020. The Trump campaign and its affiliated groups closed out June with $295 million in the bank. But Biden and the DNC, which outraised Trump and the RNC for two consecutive months, has rapidly cut down that advantage to just $53 million, according to Biden\u2019s campaign manager,\u00a0Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon. O\u2019Malley Dillon tweeted on Thursday that the campaign and its affiliates have $242 million in cash on hand, \u2018making a $100 million dent\u2019 into Trump\u2019s cash advantage just in the past three months.\u201dINCUMBENT CARNAGE CONTINUES AS ENGEL DEFEATEDNYP: \u201cJamaal Bowman\u00a0has defeated veteran Rep.\u00a0Eliot Engel, unseating the powerful chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a stunning upset, according to the Associated Press. Bowman, a progressive former middle school principal backed by the Justice Democrats, triumphed over Engel, a 16-term congressman, more than three weeks after the New York Democratic primary took place on June 23. The AP called the race on Friday morning. Engel, 73, had been besieged by gaffes and accusations he was missing from his Bronx-Westchester district as the coronavirus pandemic raged. \u2026Engel\u2019s campaign was counting on a record number of mail-in ballots cast amid the pandemic to help him overcome his challenger\u2019s commanding lead.\u00a0But Bowman\u2019s lead expanded during the weeks-long counting of absentee ballots in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District\u2026 In a statement, Bowman promised to \u2018cause problems\u2019 in Washington, a sign that the outspoken left flank of the Democratic Party, headed by Bronx Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is growing.\u201dCook slides 20 more House seats toward Ds -\u00a0Cook Political Report: \u201cTrump now trails Joe Biden by nine points in the FiveThirtyEight average, roughly matching Democrats' average lead on the generic congressional ballot and seven points larger than his 2016 popular vote deficit. But because there are plenty of solidly blue urban districts where Trump didn't have much room to fall in the first place, his decline is especially acute in swing suburban districts with lots of college graduates. Republicans began the cycle hoping to pick up 18 seats to win the majority back. Now they're just trying to avoid a repeat of 2008, when they not only lost the presidency but got swamped by Democrats' money and lost even more House seats after losing 30 seats and control two years earlier. For the first time this cycle, Democrats have at least as good a chance at gaining House seats as Republicans on a net basis.\u201dFlorida felons will have to settle fines, fees before voting rights restored -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cThe Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a request to block a Florida law requiring those who have been convicted of felonies and served their sentences to pay outstanding fines and fees owed in connection with their cases before voting. The court's order keeps the law in place heading into the state's primary election for non-presidential races, which is scheduled for Aug. 18 with a registration deadline of July 20. Justices\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor,\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and\u00a0Elena Kagan\u00a0dissented with the majority's opinion. \u2026 A District Court had blocked the law, but the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision by putting a stay on the lower court's ruling. The Supreme Court Thursday denied an appeal of the Eleventh Circuit's decision.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYAmash not going to campaign for re-election\u00a0-\u00a0The Detroit NewsAUDIBLE: RETWEET\u201cSometimes life throws you crazy curve balls and the best response is to be grateful for the blessings you do have instead of obsessing over the injustices and unfairnesses that come with life.

Watch #mediabuzz Sundays at 11 a.m. ET.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cThere's that term again, \u2018new normal.\u2019 I thought GDP of 1 or 2 percent growth was the previous 'new normal' but that didn't become normal. What was the 'new normal' prior to that? My 'normal' scorecard has become quite confusing.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mark Hoffman, Des Moines, Iowa[Ed. note: That\u2019s kind of the joke, isn\u2019t it, Mr. Hoffman. As humans, we are naturally taken with the idea that there is some \u201cnormal\u201d time, place or way of being. We obsess about it, often to destructive ends. Much of America\u2019s current trouble can be traced to the misplaced assumption that the two decades following the end of WWII were \u201cnormal\u201d and that we should, therefore, try to rearrange things to produce the same outcomes. We can\u2019t and they weren\u2019t. But just like you never can walk on the same beach twice, we can never get back to \u201cnormal.\u201d So the phrase \u201cnew normal\u2019 comes to mean the ad hoc arrangements and attitudes we make up as we go -- but don\u2019t worry, soon it will be \u201cback then\u201d\u00a0and eventually \u201cthe old days\u201d before we forget it\u00a0(and it\u2019s lessons) almost entirely.]\u201cSince you often quote from the New York Times (NYT) in the Halftime Report, I would like your opinion regarding some recent high-profile resignations from the NYT: the senior editor\u00a0James Bennet\u00a0after he allowed an op-ed by Sen.\u00a0Tom Cotton\u00a0to be published; and the opinion writer\u00a0Bari Weiss\u00a0after she refused to toe the line ideologically in her writings. Do these departures bring into question the quality of the journalism produced by the NYT? I contend that a journalist can report facts in what they write but by omitting certain other inconvenient facts they are actually misrepresenting the truth. I would even go so far as to say that the NYT is now including \u2018All the News That\u2019s Fit to Print\u2019 but with the proviso that such news is also consonant with their very restrictive politically correct culture.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Gray, Greenbelt, Md.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Ed. note: Well, I guess we could ban the NYT as a sanction for having a newsroom that sounds like it is dominated by prima donnas and attention seeker -- an army of enfant terribles who believe they are having mind-blowing realizations but who are really just scolds recycling the failed ideas of the past because no one tried to teach them or they were unwilling to learn. That might please you, I suppose. But I\u2019m not sure what the point would be. You contend that by forbidding articles from the Times we would be protecting readers from these sins of omission. First, I\u2019m not worried about you people.\u00a0 Based on the number of notes like yours we get, I\u2019m not concerned that you\u2019re being led down the primrose path to wokism -- or anyplace, for that matter. Second, while Fox News is a hugely powerful news organization, we still have to rely on the reporting of other outlets from the hyper-local to the national to get a complete look at each day\u2019s news. As a result, I don\u2019t think a ban would really be satisfying to you in the end. The Times would laugh off the pinprick that their exclusion here would cause and we would end up having to rely on a smaller pool of outlets, many of which would probably provoke similar complaints on your part. Then we might end up just going to places that only had newsrooms and attitudes that met the kind of high standards for diversity, disinterest and perspicacity we aspire to maintain for ourselves. But even we don\u2019t live up to our own standards. I think it\u2019s better if we mostly ignore newsroom politics, judge work for its own merits and not become hostage to the same kind of thought policing of which the NYT\u2019s M\u00fcnster rebellion in slim-fit slacks is guilty.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.FOX GOES AFTER WAPOWashingtonian: \u201cIt can be hard to have easy, reliable access to the news necessary to keep you informed.

The president, speaking from the East Room of the White House, alongside first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence, thanked his supporters and touted \u201crecord\u201d turnout. \u201cI want to thank the American people for their tremendous support. Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we will not stand for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe won't stand for it.\u201d Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Joe Biden's campaign manager, said\u00a0in a statement that Trump\u00a0\"does not decide the outcome of this election.\u00a0Joe Biden does not decide the outcome of this election. The American people decide the outcome of this election. And the democratic process must and will continue until its conclusion.\" The president was able to declare victory late Tuesday in battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and Iowa, and was able to clinch a big electoral win in traditionally red Texas, among other states, Fox News projected. But, a number of key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina, were too close to call. \u201cWe won states we weren\u2019t expecting to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFlorida, we didn\u2019t win it, we won it by a lot.\u201d \u201cWe won the great state of Ohio, we won Texas\u2026It is also clear that we have won Georgia,\u201d Trump said, despite that race not yet being called. \u201cThey\u2019re never gonna catch us. They can\u2019t catch us.\u201d The president said the same of North Carolina, saying he has \u201cclearly won,\u201d and again, that \u201cthey can\u2019t catch us,\u201d despite that race, too, not yet being called. The president, and his campaign throughout the night, complained about the race in Arizona, which Fox News called for his rival, Democrat Joe Biden. The campaign, and the governor of Arizona, argued that some Election Day votes still needed to be counted. CLICK HERE FOR LIVE RESULTS \u201cArizona, we have a lot of life in that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSomebody declared victory, and maybe it will be, but certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get. We\u2019re now just getting into Trump territory and that could be overturned.\u201d The president shifted to Pennsylvania, and said he was \u201cwinning\u201d in the state \u201cby a tremendous amount of votes,\u201d despite votes still being counted there. \u201cAll of a sudden, I said, what happened to the election? It\u2019s off,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what happened. They knew they couldn\u2019t win, so they said, let\u2019s go to court.\u201d Trump added that he predicted a legal battle, and said he has \u201cbeen saying this since the day I heard there would be tens of millions of ballots sent,\u201d referring to the unprecedented scale of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment on our country,\u201d Trump said, referring to the votes not being called in key states. \u201cWe were getting ready to win the election, frankly, we did win this election,\u201d Trump said, adding that he wanted to \u201censure the integrity\u201d of the vote, and ensure the law is \u201cused in a proper manner.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want all voting to stop. We don\u2019t want them to find any ballots at 4:00 in the morning and add them to the list.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad moment. To me, this is a very sad moment, and we will win this.\u201d \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we already have won it,\u201d Trump said. Biden, speaking earlier in Wilmington, Del., said just after midnight that he was \u201con track to win this election.\u201d \u201cBe patient,\u201d Biden told supporters. \u201cIt ain\u2019t over until every vote is counted\u2014every ballot is counted.\u201d He added: \u201cBut we\u2019re feeling good, we\u2019re feeling good about where we are.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden thanked supporters for their \u201cpatience,\u201d and urged them to \u201ckeep the faith, guys.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win this,\u201d Biden said.

The\u00a0Maine\u00a0Supreme Court greenlighted ranked-choice voting for the upcoming presidential election-- becoming the first state in the nation to do so -- and overriding efforts by Republicans to block the implementation of the system they say prevents voters'\u00a0rights from being\u00a0heard. The system allows voters to rank all of the candidates on the ballot. If no one wins a majority of first-place votes, then the ballots are re-tabulated by computer to eliminate the underdogs and reallocate votes\u00a0based on those supporters\u2019 second-place choices. PHILADELPHIA ELECTION OFFICIAL URGES GOP STATE LEGISLATURE TO OUTLAW SECRECY ENVELOPES FOR MAIL-IN BALLOTS The state GOP attempted to petition registered voters to support a referendum to reject ranked-choice voting, but the Supreme Judicial Court ruled Tuesday it had not met the minimum threshold necessary to so. The secretary of state had previously rejected\u00a0the referendum, ruling the GOP fell short of the needed level of 67,067 signatures of registered voters to force the issue. The Maine GOP had appealed that decision and a lower court judge sided with Republicans, reinstating enough signatures to surpass the minimum by 22 signatures. Further legalities surrounding whether petition circulators needed to be registered in the region\u00a0at the time the initiative began was\u00a0the focus of the Supreme Court's decision. Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor, joins 'FOX &amp; Friends.' The courts ruled unanimously that the requirements don\u2019t violate First Amendment rights of signature gatherers. That conclusion invalidated 988 signatures, delivering a defeat to the GOP. The decision brought relief to state officials who had already begun printing grid-style ballots for a ranked election in an effort to meet federal deadlines on absentee ballots. \u201cAs we have already printed the ballots, due to the federal deadlines we must meet to provide ballots for overseas and military voters, this decision comes as a great relief and avoids the complications, confusion, and expense that would have arisen from reprinting and reissuing ballots,\u201d Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said. The presidential ballot in Maine will include\u00a0Trump, Democratic challenger Joe Biden, and three other candidates. Other, less popular candidates, include\u00a0Howie Hawkins of the Green Party, Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party, and Rocky de la Fuente of the Alliance Party. Ranked voting will also be used in U.S. House races and the closely watched U.S. Senate race between Republican incumbent Susan Collins and Democrat Sara Gideon, the Maine House speaker. Ranked-choice voting has been a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans and further complicates a tricky voter system in Maine, which is already one of two states that divides electoral votes. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The complex electoral system highlighted divides within congressional districts throughout the state, as evidenced after Democrat Hillary Clinton won three electoral votes in\u00a0the swing 2nd Congressional District in 2016 while Trump won one electoral vote. Advocates of the ranked system say it prevents \"spoiler candidates\"-- or someone who is unlikely to win but whose\u00a0presence on the ballot nonetheless will affect\u00a0the outcome of the election-- from throwing the election.

            "article_content": "Fox News chief political anchor reacts to Supreme Court vote on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' The Senate\u00a0voted 52-48\u00a0on Monday night\u00a0to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in a move that makes the\u00a07th Circuit Court of Appeals judge and Notre Dame law professor the third appointment to the high court by President Trump, solidifying his administration's legacy even further just a week before Election Day as he seeks a second term. The last president to nominate three new justices to the Supreme Court was Ronald Reagan. \u201cJustice Barrett made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written not legislate from the bench,\u201d Trump said during a swearing in ceremony at the White House on Monday. \"\u201cThe American people put their trust in you and their faith in you as you take up the task of defending our laws, our Constitution and this country we all love.\" Monday's vote marked\u00a0the end of a confirmation process that lasted less than 40 days from when late Justice Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg died to when her successor, Barrett, was\u00a0confirmed. During that time Democrats objected loudly to the speed and timing of the confirmation just before an election.\u00a0Meanwhile,\u00a0Republicans have touted Barrett's record as an academic and a judge as impeccable -- and her \"Well Qualified\"\u00a0rating from the American Bar Association (ABA) whose representatives relayed descriptions of her as \"brilliant\" and an \"intellectual giant.\" Justice Clarence Thomas administered the Constitutional Oath to Barrett at the White House on Monday night, while Chief Justice\u00a0will administer the Judicial Oath to her in a private ceremony at the Court on Tuesday. SENATE DEMOCRATS SPEAK ALL NIGHT ON SENATE FLOOR AS BARRETT CONFIRMATION EDGES CLOSER TO MONDAY NIGHT VOTE Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was the only Republican to vote against Barrett after expressing objections to moving a Supreme Court nomination before an election after Republicans blocked Obama nominee Merrick Garland ahead of the 2016 election. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has also expressed the same concerns as Collins\u00a0and voted against a procedural motion to advance Barrett's nomination on Sunday, but she voted\u00a0for the nominee Monday after saying she would not hold her process objections against Barrett. All 45\u00a0Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats voted against Barrett's confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Sunday, as the Senate advanced a procedural motion that set up the Monday vote, that his party should \"feel good about\"\u00a0 their involvement in moving Barrett's confirmation forward. \"This is something to really be proud of and feel good about. We made an important contribution to the future of this country,\"\u00a0 McConnell said\u00a0as the Senate advanced Barrett for confirmation for a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. \"A lot\u00a0of what we've done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election ... They won't be able to do much about this for a long time to come.\" McConnell has made a point to prioritize judicial nominations during the nearly four years Trump has been the president.\u00a0Barrett will be the 220th federal judge appointed by Trump to this point in his first term, trailing only Jimmy Carter all-time. McConnell's dogged focus on judicial appointments led to there being zero remaining vacancies on federal courts of appeals -- although Barrett's confirmation Monday creates another for him to fill. CLARENCE THOMAS TO ADMINISTER OATH OF OFFICE FOR AMY CONEY BARRETT Monday's vote followed\u00a030 consecutive hours of floor debate -- running overnight Sunday into Monday -- after Republicans invoked cloture on the Barrett nomination in a rare Sunday session. The Barrett confirmation fight was not nearly as chaotic as the previous fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, which involved lurid accusations of sexual assault against the nominee and multiple rounds of hearings. In fact, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called the Barrett hearings \"one of the best Senate hearings that I've participated in.\" She added to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: \"I want to thank you for your fairness and the opportunity of going back and forth.\" Graham responded: \"I know we have very different views about the judge and whether we should be doing this or not. But having said all that, to my Democratic colleagues, you have challenged the judge, you have challenged us, and I accept those challenges as being sincere and not personal.\" The collegiality between the longtime senators does not mean\u00a0the nomination wasn't\u00a0hard-fought, however. Interest groups on both sides poured tens of millions of dollars into advertising and Senate Democrats pulled out every conceivable procedural stop to pressure Republicans. ROMNEY PRAISES SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BARRETT'S 'INTEGRITY,' SLAMS 'DIVISION AND CONTEMPT FOR OTHERS' IN US That included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., forcing several procedural votes on topics from health care to coronavirus relief to shutting down the Senate. In one stunt that was particularly effective at squeezing the GOP, Schumer\u00a0forced a vote on a measure that would ban the Justice Department from arguing against the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as it currently plans to when a case against it comes before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10. The\u00a0\"cloture\" motion on that failed 51-43 -- it needed 60 votes to pass -- but succeeded in getting six moderate or electorally vulnerable Republican senators to back it. Beyond that, Senate Democrats even boycotted the beginning of the first markup on Barrett's nomination on Oct. 15 and the entirety of the second on Oct. 21, forcing the GOP to forge ahead by\u00a0waiving committee rules that require at least two members of the minority party to be present for the committee to do business. Shortly before the vote to confirm Barrett, Schumer blasted the process as \"a decades-long effort to tilt the courts towards the right.\" \"This nomination is part of a decades-long effort to tilt the courts towards the right to accomplish through the courts what Republicans could never accomplish through Congress,\" he tweeted. But despite the pressure tactics from Democrats, Republicans stuck together and had the\u00a0votes to confirm Barrett. For many of the GOP senators, Barrett's qualifications were inescapable and were the most important factors in their votes.

            "article_content": "Washington Examiner columnist Byron York weighs in on upcoming Supreme Court battles. Rep. Doug Collins says he plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to prohibit a change to the size to the Supreme Court until 10 years after enactment of any legislation that would alter the number of seats on the high court. The legislation, which Collins, R-Ga., is set to roll out this week, comes after Democrats have threatened to pack the Supreme Court if President Trump nominates a pick to fill the vacancy left by late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ahead of the 2020 presidential election. DEMOCRATS THREATEN TO PACK SUPREME COURT IF TRUMP NOMINEE IS CONFIRMED \u201cDemocrats\u2019 latest threat to pack the Supreme Court throws our nation\u2019s history to the wayside in pursuit of political gain and threatens the very foundation of our democracy,\u201d Collins said in a statement Monday. There's a high bar to passing an amendment: In order to pass, a constitutional amendment must receive approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate, as well as ratification from three-fourths of all states, or 38 out of 50. Collins noted that since 1869, the Supreme Court has held \u201cexactly nine seats.\u201d \u201cTo make a change during such a tumultuous time in our history diminishes the integrity of our nation\u2019s highest court and sets an extremely dangerous precedent,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBy introducing a Constitutional Amendment to prohibit any changes to the number of justices until 10 years after any such legislation is signed into law, we can protect our nation\u2019s highest court from becoming a political football.\u201d Collin\u2019s comments and proposal comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., over the weekend said\u00a0the incoming Senate should \u201cimmediately\u201d expand the high court. \u201cIf Sen. McConnell and @SenateGOP were to force through a nominee during a lame duck session \u2013 before a new Senate and President can take office \u2013 then the incoming Senate should immediately move to expand the Supreme Court,\u201d Nadler tweeted over the weekend. \u201cFilling the SCOTUS vacancy during a lame duck session, after the American people have voted for new leadership, is undemocratic and a clear violation of the public trust in elected officials.\u201d Nadler added: \u201cCongress would have to act and expanding the court would be the right place to start.\u201d Just hours after learning of Ginsburg\u2019s passing on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed that a\u00a0Trump nominee to the Supreme Court\u00a0\u201cwill receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d The president has also urged Senate Republicans to move forward in confirming his eventual nominee \u201cwithout delay,\u201d and told Fox News during an exclusive interview Monday that the confirmation should be complete before Election Day. But Democrats in both chambers of Congress are threatening to implement a strategy and pack the Supreme Court if they take control of the White House and the Senate. \u201cIf he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021,\u201d Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., tweeted Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201d MARKEY THREATENS TO PACK SUPREME COURT, ABOLISH FILIBUSTER IF TRUMP FILLS SEAT \u201cMitch McConnell set the precedent. No Supreme Court vacancies filled in an election year. If he violates it, when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court,\u201d Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., tweeted. The idea of \u201cpacking\u201d the court with extra justices \u2013\u00a0attempted unsuccessfully\u00a0by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1937 to force through parts of his New Deal that were\u00a0ruled unconstitutional by the high court \u2013\u00a0has bubbled away on the fringes of the party for years. But it began to seep into the mainstream after Republicans refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland \u2013\u00a0President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia \u2013\u00a0because it was an election year. Consequently, the seat was held open until after the 2017 inauguration of President Trump, who nominated now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. Many Democrats saw the seat as \u201cstolen\u201d as a result. The Garland controversy has been cited by Democrats again now that Republicans are moving to fill Ginsburg's seat\u00a0in an election year. They say that because Republicans refused to fill a seat in 2016, they should decline to fill this one in 2020. Republicans, however, have said that the precedent is when the Senate is controlled by an opposition party to the White House.

You should go out and vote.\u201d President Trump chimed in, repeating moderator Chris Wallace\u2019s question about if Biden would \u201cpack the court\u201d but the former vice president didn\u2019t answer. Biden\u2019s refusal\u00a0to answer the question seemed like it would be among the\u00a0news-making moments\u00a0from the debate, but it received little attention in The New York Times and Washington Post. \"Biden's refusal to comment on packing the Supreme Court, as other prominent Democrats are advocating, is monumental news as it goes to the Democrats' willingness and desire to unwind one of the fundamental norms of our judiciary and\u00a0political system, a 9-member Supreme Court,\u201d Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News. BIDEN REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER HE WOULD ADD SEATS TO SUPREME COURT The Times\u00a0briefly\u00a0mentioned Biden\u2019s non-answer\u00a0when noting he \u201crefused to endorse some policies popular among progressives, like\u00a0packing the Supreme Court\u00a0and enacting the\u00a0Green New Deal\u201d in a recap of the debate. Meanwhile, the Post\u00a0mentioned that Biden\u00a0\u201cpointedly declined to attach himself to a push by liberals upset over Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court to abolish the filibuster or pack the Supreme Court\u201d in an\u00a0article about takeaways from the debate. Neither paper had a splashy headline or full-length\u00a0story about\u00a0Biden\u2019s refusal to answer the question. \u201cHad the roles been reversed, and Trump refused to comment on Republican plans to pack the Court, the New York Times and Washington Post would have screaming headlines,\u201d Jacobson\u00a0said. \u201cThe relative silence once again demonstrates that mainstream news coverage is focused on assisting the Biden campaign through what they don't cover.\" KAMALA HARRIS CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF PRESS AVAILABILITY: 'WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF?' While the Times and Post downplayed Biden\u2019s refusal to answer the question,\u00a0other members of the mainstream media pointed out that he dodged the simple question. CNN senior political commentator John Kasich, a Republican who supports Biden, even felt the Democratic nominee should have been more definitive. \u201cI thought he had a very weak answer in terms of packing the court or whatever,\u201d\u00a0Kasich said\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0when analyzing Biden\u2019s performance. Democratic vice-presidential candidate\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0echoed her running mate\u00a0and also\u00a0sidestepped a pair of questions immediately following the debate. CBS News\u2019 John Dickerson confronted Harris, saying Biden\u2019s non-answer sounded like a \u201cstraight up dodge\u201d and asked why he\u00a0refuses\u00a0to\u00a0talk about it. \u201cWell, I think he\u2019s very clear, John, which is he is focused, as we all should be, on the next 35 days,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe is focused on ...\u00a0the process.\" KAMALA HARRIS PARROTS BIDEN AFTER DEBATE, REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER THEY WILL \u2018PACK\u2019 SUPREME COURT CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper also confronted Harris on the idea of adding seats to the Supreme Court, flatly asking if it\u2019s an idea she\u2019s \u201cwilling to think about\u201d but Biden\u2019s running mate was noncommittal once again. \u201cWe are 35 days away from an election... probably the most important election of our lifetime and out children\u2019s lifetime, and there is nothing about these next 35 days that Joe or I will take for granted,\u201d\u00a0Harris said. \u201cThe focus right now is on reminding people that we have this election that is very much in play... we are\u00a0in the midst of\u00a0an election.\u201d The Biden campaign directed Fox News to a quote the Democratic nominee gave to reporters earlier this week when asked\u00a0if Biden plans on informing the American people about his intentions for the Supreme Court prior to Election Day. \u201cI know you\u2019re\u00a0gonna\u00a0be upset with my answer, but what I\u2019m not\u00a0gonna\u00a0do is play the Trump game, which is a good game he plays -- take your eye off the issue before us... if I were to say yes or no to that, that becomes a big issue. That\u2019s the headline here,\u201d Biden told reporters on Sunday when asked if he would consider expanding the Supreme Court.

By their very own standard, could there be any issue more important than\u00a0whether or not\u00a0Joe Biden supports packing the court? The truth is that the\u00a0main stream\u00a0media is giving Biden a pass because they know -- like Biden\u2019s campaign knows\u00a0--\u00a0that if he says he supports it he turns off moderates and is he says he opposes it he turns off liberals.\u201d Others took to Twitter with thoughts on Biden's refusal to answer:",

            "article_content": "Biden holds slight lead in state with nearly 40,000 mail-in ballots uncounted; Eric Shawn reports. The Republican Party in Pennsylvania is asking the Supreme Court to order the state\u00a0to segregate all late-arriving absentee ballots, in hopes that their suit to disallow the state from counting ballots that arrive after Nov. 3 but are postmarked by then could be successful. The state GOP filed a request, which will go to Justice Samuel Alito, from the conservative wing of the court. The state was already segregating these ballots before the emergency appeal was filed. The state party request says:\u00a0\u201cThe Court to order Respondents Secretary of State Boockvar and the county boards of elections to log, to segregate, and otherwise not to take any action related to any ballots that arrive after the General Assembly\u2019s Election Day received-by deadline but before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s judicially extended deadline.\u201d ELECTION 2020 LEGAL BATTLES UNDERWAY: JUDGES WEIGH IN ON LEGAL BATTLES IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES On Oct. 28, the high court\u00a0said it wouldn\u2019t fast-track an appeal to block vote-counting after Nov. 3. Alito had written a statement conceding \"there is simply not enough time\" to issue a pre-election decision. The court's refusal to issue a fast-track decision does not mean it won't rule in the case. The petition asking for the court's review remains before the justices. Therefore, Alito could ask the state to respond to the emergency appeal and set a deadline for those briefs to be filed. An\u00a0order is expected in the coming days. The Supreme Court could step in to overturn the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the ruling that essentially changed state election law, and void votes after they have been cast in a state that has the potential to decide the presidential election, which is what Republicans are hoping. Meanwhile, Democrats in the state have asked the high court to hold off on any action on the petition from Republicans to strike down the three-day extension. \"There is no reason for the Court to expedite consideration of the pending petitions, let alone to grant certiorari at this time,\" the Pennsylvania Democratic Party said in its brief, urging the justices to exercise further patience. \"Because this Court may well not need to hear and decide these cases, it would be premature for this Court to rule on the motion to intervene,\" the state party also said. \"Without an immediate order from the court [Pennsylvania's GOP] could lose its right to 'a targeted remedy'\u00a0if the State Supreme Court\u2019s decision is ultimately overturned,\u201d they said. Democratic nominee Joe Biden currently leads in the state by about 13,700 votes, with 98 percent of precincts reporting. SUPREME COURT COULD STILL OVERTURN PA MAIL-IN BALLOT DEADLINE EXTENSION AFTER ELECTION Given the tight results of the Nov. 3 election, Pennsylvania could determine the next president of the U.S., and the Trump campaign and the GOP have filed a litany of lawsuits alleging procedural violations. An appellate court in the state handed the Trump campaign a win Thursday by allowing election\u00a0watchers to stand as close as six feet away from vote counters to ensure a fair process in Philadelphia. The campaign then said that election\u00a0workers were not following the ruling and blocking election\u00a0watchers from entering vote-counting rooms, and requested Pennsylvania stop counting votes until there was transparency. A federal judge denied the campaign's request to stop the vote in Philadelphia over observer access, instead urging the sides to forge an agreement. Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Paul Diamond scheduled an emergency hearing over the suit, before pushing the parties to reach agreement during recess, then ruling that each side could have 60 observers in the vote-counting room\u00a0as long as they could follow social distancing and stay behind a barrier. On Thursday, the campaign asked the court to stop allowing voters to provide late missing proof of identification on Nov. 9, rather than Nov. 12. A judge then ordered the county boards of elections to segregate ballots for which ID was validated by Nov. 9 and ballots with valid IDs between Nov. 9 and 12. The segregated ballots \u201cshall not be counted until further order of this court.\u201d The court hasn't decided the underlying issue: how long to allow for absentee and mail-in voters to provide identification. But, they're asking Pennsylvania\u00a0to make sure the small subset of ballots at issue in the case are segregated from the rest. The lawsuit filed Wednesday was against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and 67 county election boards, claiming a guidance letter from Boockfar sent out Nov. 1 \u201cre-writes the Election Code\u201d by \u201cresetting the deadline for absentee and mail-in voters to provide missing proof of identification\u201d to the sixth day after the end of canvassing, which is Nov. 12. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Election Code says the deadline is \u201cthe sixth day following the election,\u201d which the campaign notes is Nov. 9. People who do not provide proof of identification in time are to have their ballots discarded. Fox News' Bill Mears, Shannon Bream and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.",

By telling Senate Republicans Saturday they have an obligation to fill\u00a0\u201cwithout delay\u201d\u00a0the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of\u00a0Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Trump sets in motion a process that could dominate the remaining weeks of the presidential election.

Those would be the memories of the Supreme Court deciding the\u00a02000 presidential election\u00a0by settling disputes over paper ballots. REP. ANDY BIGGS: TRUMP, NOMINATE RBG REPLACEMENT NOW\u00a0\u2013 HERE'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT A key ruling in Bush v. Gore held that Florida\u2019s use of different standards for counting votes in different counties was unconstitutional, by a 7-2 vote. And, by a 5-4 vote, the court also said there was no time to fix the process before the Electoral College met to certify the election. The result was George W. Bush won Florida\u2019s 25 electoral votes, giving him 271 to Al Gore\u2019s 266. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER To many Americans, the case probably seems like ancient history, if they know it at all, but there\u2019s a strong chance the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0will have to make rulings in this presidential race, too. All the more reason, then, why the court should have its full complement of nine justices. Democrats vehemently vow to oppose the prospect of a\u00a0sixth constitutional conservative\u00a0on the bench, and already far-leftists are threatening violence. If nothing else, that should stiffen the spines of some Republican senators who are leery of taking up the issue. It is their job, and slinking into the fetal position in the face of controversy and threats is unspeakable cowardice. Trump and Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0have precedents on their side in that history is sprinkled with election-year high-court nominations and confirmations when the White House and Senate are controlled by the same party. Dem Presidents FDR and Woodrow Wilson did it, with Wilson having two nominations confirmed in 1916 as he sought reelection. However, I cannot find any examples that came so close to Election Day as the current case. But as\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz\u00a0noted, the calendar should be a reason to move forward, not an excuse to delay. Cruz, a Texas Republican, argues that a 4-4 ruling in a case like Bush v. Gore would create a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d and must be prevented. If the outcome of the election depended on a court ruling, which is certainly possible given the passions and the potential machinations involved in\u00a0universal mail-in voting, a tie vote at the Supreme Court could leave America without a president and no way to resolve the issue. Politically motivated violence is already spreading, so imagine what might happen if the election remains undecided. America\u2019s great history of the peaceful transfer of power could be at risk. If that sounds far-fetched, consider some of the suspect decisions already being made in various states that deliberately weaken ballot security. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, for example, voted last week along party lines (the judges are elected) that county drop boxes, including unattended ones, could be used to collect votes. The argument that every vote should count is valid only to the extent that every voter\u2019s identity has been verified. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, and his party supported the measure, which reached the court by lawsuits, thus avoiding GOP control of both legislative chambers. The decision obviously opens the door to potential fraud because ballots in unsecured drop boxes\u00a0could be tampered\u00a0with or stolen. \u201cThis ruling is not about ensuring fair elections \u2013\u00a0it is about allowing one party to steal this election,\u201d two top state Republican legislators said in a statement. New Jersey\u2019s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy also made some curious decisions. A Jersey friend sent me a mailer he received that was addressed only to \u201cResidential Customer.\u201d Inside, a pamphlet from the county clerk in Bergen County said that a Murphy order \u201crequires\u201d every county to mail a ballot to \u201cevery active registered voter.\u201d That raises the chances of thousands of unmarked ballots being stolen from the post office or front porches, practices not exactly unheard of in New Jersey. In fact, a recent Post story revealed the\u00a0dirty tricks and fraud committed\u00a0by a longtime Dem operative in the state, who says mail-in ballots are a gold mine for those who want to cheat. That becomes even easier under the new rules. Jersey voters can mail their ballots back, hand deliver them to polling sites by Nov.\u20093 or put them into those vulnerable drop boxes scattered around each county. In what seems like an invitation for manipulation, the pamphlet also promises that if a ballot is rejected because of a \u201cmissing or discrepant signature,\u201d the voter will be contacted and offered the chance to \u201ccure the defect\u201d under rules \u201cestablished\u201d by the secretary of state. Then there was this Associated Press story from Atlanta: \u201cIn a presidential election year, there\u2019s always a push to get people registered to vote. For one Atlanta family, that push got a little interesting. \u201cRon Tims said he checked his mail Wednesday and found a voter registration application addressed to Cody Tims \u2013\u00a0his cat, who died 12 years ago.\u201d Giving a cat a ballot is one thing \u2013\u00a0but a dead cat? The secretary of state\u2019s office said it had nothing to do with the application, blaming \u201cout-of-town activists\u201d trying to register voters in hopes of swaying the election. How comforting. Although most of these decisions are tied to the coronavirus, the potential for cheating and mistakes multiplies when voters are never required to present themselves in\u00a0person to register or vote. Most state systems are not designed to handle mass mail-in voting, which is why the decisions to create new, extra-lenient rules on the fly are so troubling. The argument that every vote should count is valid only to the extent that every voter\u2019s identity has been verified. That is especially important in states and municipalities that allow noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in local elections. It would be a crime if they voted in federal elections \u2013\u00a0if they are caught. But with the guardrails removed, who is to catch them? Because disputes are certain to emerge over how and what votes are counted in November, Trump and Joe Biden are\u00a0loading up with lawyers\u00a0ready to fight it out in swing states. The approach makes it almost certain some cases will get to federal courts, and one or more likely will make it to the high court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While it might seem a no-brainer for\u00a0Dems to oppose\u00a0a lifetime Trump nominee as they aim to win the White House and Senate, the prospect of a deadlocked Supreme Court on the election presents an unacceptable danger for the entire nation. Elections need to be seen as fair and final if Americans are to keep what little faith we still have in our government institutions. This column first appeared in the New York Post.

            "article_content": "Former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker weighs in. The Maine Superior Court dealt a blow to organizations and voters who are looking to relax state laws dealing with absentee voting, including those\u00a0involving third parties turning in ballots and the state's Election Day deadline for receiving them. Justice William R. Stokes denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked state officials from enforcing the current laws, claiming that state interests -- including the desire to prevent voter fraud -- outweigh any burdens that may be imposed on voters. One such law forbids third parties from being compensated for collecting and turning in ballots, a practice often referred to as ballot harvesting. PHILADELPHIA ELECTION OFFICIAL URGES GOP STATE LEGISLATURE TO OUTLAW SECRECY ENVELOPES FOR MAIL-IN BALLOTS \u201c[T]he slight burden on the right to vote imposed by the prohibition on paid deliverers of absentee ballots is clearly outweighed by the State\u2019s compelling interest in forbidding the payment of compensation to those handling another person\u2019s ballot,\u201d Stokes wrote in the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cSuch a prohibition serves the State\u2019s important interest in deterring and preventing election fraud.\u201d The lawsuit also contests a law imposing strict requirements in cases where an absentee ballot is submitted by a third party who is not an immediate family member. In such cases, the state requires the voter to sign their ballot before a municipal clerk, a clerk of courts, a notary public\u00a0or two other witnesses. The plaintiffs argued that these requirements are \u201cburdensome\u201d and \u201cunnecessary,\u201d but the court ruled that having a nonfamily third party deliver the ballot \u201cis simply another option for an absentee voter to use in deciding how to return the ballot.\u201d A voter also has the option to submit the ballot in person to the clerk or a secure lockbox, by mail\u00a0or through an immediate family member, the court noted. Once again, voter fraud was mentioned in explaining the court\u2019s reasoning. \u201cAlthough there has been considerable discussion and debate about the prevalence (or lack thereof) of voter fraud, there can be no question as to the State\u2019s compelling interest in reasonably regulating how a ballot is handled, and by whom, when the voter chooses not to appear for in-person voting,\u201d the ruling said. RANKED CHOICE VOTING OK'D BY MAINE SUPREME COURT, REJECTING REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION The court also said the plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their argument that officials should be required to notify absentee voters if their ballots are rejected as invalid and that a deadline to cure any error should be after Election Day. Ballots can be rejected if there are mismatched or missing signatures or a \u201cdefective\u201d certificate from an aide or witness. The court noted that days after the filing of the lawsuit, Maine\u2019s secretary of state issued instructions to election officials stating that they \u201cmust make a good faith effort to notify the voter as quickly as possible \u2026 that the ballot may be rejected or challenged unless the defect is cured.\u201d The instruction calls for clerks to attempt to reach voters \u201cwithin one business day at a minimum\u201d or \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d if the ballot is received on Election Day or less than 24 hours beforehand. Stokes ruled that while the instructions do not carry the same weight as law, they are legally sufficient to meet due process requirements. MICHIGAN SENATE PASSES VOTER-FRAUD BILLS THAT WOULD MAKE SOME OFFENSES A FELONY Finally, the court rejected the idea that ballots should be accepted after the current deadline of 8 p.m. on Election Day. The plaintiffs argued that as long as ballots are postmarked on or before Nov.\u00a03 they should be counted for up to at least a week after Election Day. The court agreed that the coronavirus pandemic has led to increased voting by mail, and that \u201cCOVID-19 and the issues with the Postal Service have complicated voting in the year 2020.\" Nevertheless, the court said it does\u00a0not believe that the state\u2019s deadline is the reason for \u201cany increased burden\u201d on voting. \u201cIt is a deadline, and just like any deadline, there can be serious consequences if it is not met,\u201d the court said. Supporting its determination, the court noted that in places like Georgia and Wisconsin where deadlines have been extended, there was evidence that they had problems with other elections earlier in the year. Maine, however, had \u201clittle controversy\u201d with its\u00a0July 14 primary election. The court went on to explain that moving the deadline would give voters an impression that government deadlines need not be taken seriously. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cA judicial declaration that the statutory deadline is not really a deadline at all, and can be altered and extended for a week or more, risks undermining voter confidence that the law means what it says and that the voting and the election are over,\u201d the ruling said. The Trump campaign, Republican National Committee\u00a0and the Republican Party of Maine all intervened as defendants in the case, which was initially brought in June against Maine's Democratic\u00a0Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap and Attorney General Aaron Frey.

            "article_content": "If Trump pushes SCOTUS nominee through. When karma lands, it lands hard. This is the lesson Democrats are now learning with the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg, and the reality that President Trump will move forward to fill her seat this week. In years past, Democrats might have had the tools to stop the process in its tracks, or the comity and goodwill to be able to reach a compromise with Senate Republicans or the White House. But they have squandered their goodwill and disarmed their senators, leaving them with little to do but fume and threaten. Democrats say they are angry about the precedent and propriety of a hurry-up nomination process. They invoke Ginsburg\u2019s supposed \u201cdying wish\u201d she \u201cnot be replaced until a new president is installed.\" JIM DALY: PASSING OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG PUTS THIS ALL-IMPORTANT ISSUE AT CENTER OF 2020 CAMPAIGN Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., threatened that \u201cnothing is off the table\u00a0for next year\u201d if Senate Republicans move the process forward. And Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u00a0tweeted\u00a0his contempt for the Supreme Court, saying: \u201cIf he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d But this is a case of \u201ccoup karma.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER If the Left can unilaterally impeach and try to remove a president during an election year, a Supreme Court justice can certainly be appointed during an election year. Democrats can hardly stand on principle regarding election year nominations when they were more than willing to engage in a partisan, election-year impeachment fiasco based on a contrived pretext that had no chance of prevailing. The impeachment followed other failed attempts to sabotage Trump \u2013 illicit spying, the \u201cinsurance policy,\u201d seeking to invoke the 25th\u00a0Amendment to remove him from office, and the Mueller \u201cwitch hunt\u201d investigation that harassed him despite almost everyone in D.C. knowing that there was never any evidence of Russian collusion. After the Mueller fiasco flamed out, Democrats weaponized the whistleblower process to create a fake scandal out of a harmless July 25, 2019, conversation between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. This became the basis for what George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley\u00a0called\u00a0\u201cthe shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.\u201d Recall that the impeachment moved out of the House based on an unprecedented party-line vote! The fact that the coup impeachment was occurring as an election was looming made no impression on Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her minions, who were eager to leave Trump \u201cimpeached forever\u201d (though he was also acquitted forever). Byron York\u00a0called\u00a0it \u201can election-year gambit\u201d using the impeachment as \u201cthe most audacious opposition research maneuver of all time.\u201d And Berkeley law professor John Yoo\u00a0cautioned\u00a0that the Founding Fathers\u00a0would have rejected the idea of an election-year impeachment because they \u201cexpected that the American people would hold a president accountable for any abuses of power at the ballot box.\u201d We are staring down the barrel of potentially the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War, and we need nine justices on the bench. So it is ironic to hear Democrats saying that the people should decide\u00a0who gets to choose\u00a0the next Supreme Court justice when they were more than willing to deny voters the opportunity to judge President Trump\u2019s fitness for office. Defenders of the election-year impeachment also\u00a0argued\u00a0that the timing was valid since the \u201ccrimes\u201d under investigation might affect the outcome of the election itself. A similar argument can be made regarding filling Ginsburg\u2019s vacant seat. The Left has hired 600 hundred lawyers for the Biden campaign and intends the Supreme Court to be an active participant in the 2020 election. The stakes going into November are frankly too high to have a Supreme Court not at full strength. Democrats have pushed for a mail-in election that virtually guarantees fraud and chaos and subsequent urgent litigation. They have instructed Democratic nominee Joe Biden not to concede under any circumstances and have threatened violence if they do not win. The country cannot afford to have an eight-member Supreme Court that could deadlock on critical questions coming from these dangerous circumstances. We are staring down the barrel of potentially the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War, and we need nine justices on the bench. As then-President Obama\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in October 2016, \u201cthe need for a ninth justice is undeniably clear.\u201d There is plenty of time. Justice Ginsburg was confirmed only 42 days after she was nominated by President Bill Clinton. President Trump\u2019s nominee should get the same speedy consideration by the Senate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A confirmation vote by Oct.\u00a030 is completely doable. Especially since a cabal of corrupt politicians tried to ram through an election-year impeachment and failed. Again, coup karma. It is absurd to suggest a president whose party controls the Senate should jointly decline to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat \u2013 ever. Fill the seat. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TOM FITTON",

CLICK HERE TO SEE FOX NEWS'\u00a0LIVE PROBABILITY DIALS Pennsylvania, which had been predicted to be a potential key state, could remain undeclared for days, if not longer. Too many mail-in ballots remain uncounted with several counties waiting until Wednesday to tally them. At daybreak, President Trump held a substantial lead over Joe Biden, but Democratic officials were confident that would change. \u201cWhen all the votes are counted Vice President Joe Biden is going to win Pennsylvania and be well on his way to necessary electoral votes to win the Presidency,\u201d Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., tweeted early Wednesday. \u201cIt's going to take time and we all need to exercise patience.\u201d Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani disputed this in an early morning tweet, pointing to how Trump was leading Biden by roughly 700,000 votes at the time. \"It is a lie that it is too close to call,\" Giuliani said. Pennsylvania's votes\u00a0will likely not be tallied for several days, as predicted by Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar. While most states began processing early votes in advance, Pennsylvania does not begin the counting process until Election Day itself. The state is currently allowing mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day (and those without postmarks) to be counted until Friday, but ballots received after Tuesday will be segregated until the Supreme Court determines how they should be handled. CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS Republicans are in the process of challenging a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that granted the three-day extension for mail-in ballots. They also filed lawsuits Tuesday over whether voters whose mail-in ballots were disqualified should have been permitted to submit a provisional ballot, and whether officials in Montgomery County acted improperly by letting voters fix problems with their mail-in ballots before Tuesday. It remains possible that none of these lawsuits will matter, depending on the results of the total vote count. The difference between Trump and Biden could end up being greater than the number of ballots in dispute. But Pennsylvania is just one state that hangs in the balance where legal battles are either expected or already underway. The Trump and Biden campaigns have assembled armies of attorneys to wage war in cases. Trump\u2019s campaign has formed what it has called \u201cLawyers for Trump,\u201d a coalition to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of the election. PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS IT WILL TAKE 'DAYS' TO COUNT 'OVERWHELMING MAJORITY' OF VOTES The coalition is being led by Texas\u00a0Attorney General Ken Paxton and Arkansas\u00a0Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, as well as California\u00a0Committee Member Harmeet Dhillon and former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino. The group includes prominent Trump-allied attorneys like Giuliani. former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi\u00a0and former Attorney General Ed Meese. The\u00a0Biden campaign, meanwhile,\u00a0built a massive \"election protection program,\" including\u00a0former Attorney General Eric Holder and hundreds of other lawyers\u00a0in preparation for a\u00a0legal battle\u00a0in the event of a contested election. A national team for special litigation features former Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger, and a team at the law firm Perkins Coie, which is headed by Marc Elias. Perkins Coie played a key role in Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, and it was Elias who Fusion GPS, the firm that conducted opposition research that ultimately included Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier. The Biden team's lawyers will focus state-by-state on protecting voter access to the polls and a \u201cfair and accurate vote count.\u201d In North Carolina, which was also too close to call early Wednesday, a deadline extension for mail-ballots allowed votes to be counted if they are received by November 12. Nevada, also still up in the air Wednesday morning, allows ballots to be received until November 10. Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia\u00a0and Maine \u2014\u00a0which all remained undeclared Tuesday night \u2014 kept Election Day deadlines for accepting mail-in votes, but not without legal challenges that sought extensions. Minnesota also segregated late ballots during a battle over a seven-day extension, but the Fox News Decision Desk projects Biden to win that state. Biden attorney Bob Bauer said Tuesday that many lawsuits from Republicans the around the country were only meant to get attention and to arouse suspicion, lacking any legal basis. \"They're designed to generate the appearance of a cloud over the election,\"\u00a0he said, according to The Associated Press. Court documents and a number of judicial rulings would suggest otherwise, however. One argument that has often been raised in opposing deadline extensions is what is known as the Purcell principle \u2014 the idea put forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s 2006 decision in Purcell v. Gonzalez that courts should not change election rules close to an election, out of fear it could confuse voters. Given that Election Day has come and gone and votes have been cast, the GOP would likely have to rely on other legal theories. In Pennsylvania and North Carolina, those arguments have involved whether the bodies that granted the extensions had the authority to do so. Typically, it is up to state legislatures to set election rules. Pennsylvania\u2019s deadline extension was granted via court order after a request from Democrats. In North Carolina, a state election board made the change without the legislature. These battles and others could mean the country may not learn the ultimate outcome of the election for weeks.\u00a0Trump appeared to grow impatient early Wednesday. \u201cWe were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,\u201d Trump said, calling the delays a \u201cfraud.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Biden campaign pushed back in a statement of their own. \u201cDonald Trump does not decide the outcome of this election. Joe Biden does not decide the outcome of this election. The American people decide the outcome of this election. And the democratic process must and will continue until its conclusion.\u201d Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Fox News correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the next steps in the Supreme Court nomination process. President Trump on Wednesday predicted the U.S. Supreme Court may decide the outcome of November's presidential\u00a0election, highlighting the importance he's put on the Senate quickly confirming his eventual nominee. In order to prevent a four-four split on a potential election-related issue, Trump suggested during a roundtable event that lawmakers should take swift action on his candidate, who is expected to be announced on Saturday. \u201cI think this will end up in the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd I think it's very important that we have nine justices.\u201d While the winner of a presidential election is generally called just hours after polls close, the coronavirus pandemic has shifted the landscape and is forcing millions of Americans to vote by mail, which means final results may not be known until days after the election. The president has voiced concerns about mail-in voting, which he has repeatedly claimed could lead to voter fraud. ANDREW MCCARTHY: BIDEN REFUSES TO SAY IF HE FAVORS PACKING SUPREME COURT \u2014 AMONG KEY QUESTIONS HE WON\u2019T ANSWER Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Trump in 2017, is a\u00a0likely\u00a0frontrunner for the vacant\u00a0seat. House Republicans\u00a0wrote a letter to the president on Wednesday, pushing him to nominate Barrett. Another top contender is Barbara Lagoa, a Cuban-American who serves on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president has said he would nominate a woman and is reportedly considering five people, all of whom he called as \u201cbrilliant\u201d on Wednesday. Trump has already appointed conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch during his term. Ginsburg died Friday at the age of 87 from metastatic pancreatic cancer complications. Ginsburg was appointed to the high court in 1993, after being nominated by former President Bill Clinton.",

            "article_content": "President Trump praises Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett during a phone interview on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' Senate Republicans succeeded Thursday in winning Judiciary Committee approval for the confirmation of conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett for a seat on the Supreme Court, setting the stage for a vote expected in the full Senate next week that will make her a high court justice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is rushing Barrett\u2019s confirmation through the Senate with only Republican support as quickly as humanly possible. His goal is obvious: getting Barrett onto the Supreme Court just in time for the Nov. 3 election. Moving full speed ahead, McConnell has even prioritized the Supreme Court confirmation over passing desperately needed legislation to provide economic relief for millions of unemployed Americans, struggling families, businesses, schools, and local and state governments devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. #VOTEPROCHOICE CEO HEIDI SIECK: AMY CONEY BARRETT DOES NOT BELONG ON THE SUPREME COURT \u2013 HERE'S WHY Before we give McConnell and his GOP colleagues a trophy for the fastest Supreme Court justice confirmation in American history, let\u2019s remember that Thursday\u2019s vote is another case of window dressing for what has been a foregone conclusion. After the sad and untimely death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 18, the Republican-controlled Senate and White House had no intention of allowing the Senate to function as intended by our founders \u2014 as a place of great compromise, civility and decorum to give advice and consent on a replacement justice. Instead, we are witnessing a disgraceful triad of a broken Senate, a mismanaged White House, and an overzealous conservative movement determined to fill federal judicial vacancies with far-right ideologues \u2014 including some unqualified jurists. These right-wing extremist judges are willing to overturn American judicial precedents and fundamentally change our long legacy of minority rights and civil rights expansion. Since the last year of President Barack Obama\u2019s term in the White House, the American people have been told by McConnell, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and other Republicans that it is improper for a president to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year. Let the American voters pick a president and that president could then pick a Supreme Court justice, McConnell and his allies solemnly told us. This unprecedented rule invented by McConnell was used by Republicans to block President Obama from appointing U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court almost eight months before the 2016 presidential election. But McConnell recently altered the rule he concocted to say it only applies when the president is a member of one political party and the Senate is controlled by the other party. How convenient. So while it was too late in March 2016 for the Senate to confirm Garland to the Supreme Court, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the Senate confirming Barrett in October this year \u2014 even though millions of Americans have already voted, McConnell tells us with a straight face. Senate Republicans are engaging in hypocrisy of the highest order. They are making clear that they don\u2019t care about democracy, but only care about exercising power to reshape the Supreme Court and lower courts to support far-right causes. Millions of American who are casting ballots in the election now already underway want to ensure clean air and water for their families, equitable rights for the LGBTQ community, fairness and justice for people of color, and access to high-quality reproductive health care for women. Senate Republicans and President Trump don\u2019t care. Many voters are also looking for an end to blatant and heinous voter suppression tactics in Georgia, Texas, Florida and a host of other states. Regrettably, their hopes of change can and likely will be hindered by Amy Coney Barrett's originalist judicial doctrine once she gets a seat on the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans and President Trump don\u2019t care. With COVID-19 on the front of so many voters\u2019 minds, the GOP's triumph in this Supreme Court nomination battle could also be the final blow to the popular Affordable Care Act and the health care access it provides for millions of Americans, including those suffering from pre-existing conditions. Before you chastise me for jumping to conclusions on Barrett, I realize that no one knows for certain how she would rule on many of the consequential cases before the high court. Her Senate confirmation hearing increased that level of uncertainty. The one thing we know is that Judge Barrett \u2014 who currently serves on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 believes that the Constitution must be interpreted based on the original understanding \"at the time it was adopted.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Barrett stands by a doctrine based on what reasonable citizens in 1787 would understand as the text's ordinary meaning. For context, in 1787 African American were held in slavery and were considered property. Women had no right to vote and very few other rights that they have today. LGBTQ people were considered deviants without rights as well. And climate change, degradation of our environment, and many other major issues facing us today were of no concern to Americans. Much as conservatives would like, we can\u2019t turn back the clock 233 years. It\u2019s unfortunate that Republicans have elevated ideology to become the major consideration in judicial appointments. It\u2019s unfortunate that when Barrett gets on the Supreme Court, as now seems inevitable, she will create a 6-3 conservative majority that wants to drag America backward instead of moving us forward. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If we are genuinely striving to make the United States a more fair and just country, we must acknowledge the importance of expanding the American Dream to those yearning for equity and equality. Most importantly, we must prioritize minorities\u2019 rights and the court's role in upholding them. While we can't stop soon-to-be Justice Barrett's appointment to the Supreme Court, we can vote as we have never voted before. When we do so, we should remember which Republican senators lied to us. More importantly, we should vote with the courts at the forefront of our minds, understanding that their impact profoundly affects our lives, communitues and country.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted a\u00a0three-day extension for mail-in ballots\u00a0in the November election \u2013 allowing votes to count in the battleground state even if they arrive a little late. The state traditionally required\u00a0mail-in ballots to be due by the time polls close on Election Day. Now ballots will be counted if they're received by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6 --\u00a0as long as they're postmarked by 8 p.m. on Election Day, according to the\u00a0court\u2019s order. The Supreme Court noted its\u00a0ability to grant the new mail-in measures because of language in Pennsylvania\u2019s Election Code, which states that courts have the \u201cauthority to provide relief when there is a natural disaster or emergency,\u201d in order to allow residents to exercise their right to vote. The ruling was in response to the state\u00a0Democratic Party suing for a deadline extension. The decision comes amid a national controversy involving the efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service and ira\u00a0ability to cope with an\u00a0expected increase of mail-in ballots\u00a0due to the coronavirus pandemic and interest in the presidential election. The court\u2019s decision is seen as a win for Democrats\u00a0as President Trump and other Republicans\u00a0have been floating the idea that mail-in ballots can be subject to fraud and will invalidate the election\u2019s results. \u201cUnsolicited Ballots are uncontrollable, totally open to ELECTION INTERFERENCE by foreign countries, and will lead to massive chaos and confusion!\u201d Trump tweeted\u00a0Thursday. Though the social media platform flagged his message with a blue\u00a0exclamation mark, which warns of \u201cmisleading\u201d content and directs the viewer to a link that says, \u201cLearn how voting by mail is safe and secure.\u201d TRUMP SLAMS NEVADA GOVERNOR, CLAIMS 'HE'LL CHEAT ON THE BALLOTS' Pennsylvania is not the only state that will permit\u00a0votes to be counted after the polls close on Election Day. Eighteen other states and the District of Colombia have traditionally permitted a grace period to count votes after the polls close -- 10 of which went Republican in the last presidential election. Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Pennsylvania\u00a0are all swing states that voted red during the 2016\u00a0presidential election, and\u00a0permit postmarked ballots that arrive after Election Day. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Though Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, the margin\u00a0over opponent Hillary Clinton was slim. Before electing Trump in the last presidential race, Pennsylvania had not voted for a Republican\u00a0since Ronald Regan in 1988. The court also declared Thursday, that ballot drop boxes are legal and therefore permitted throughout the state. The ruling will likely anger\u00a0some Republicans as the Trump campaign had previously sued unsuccessfully in federal court to block drop boxes nationally.",

Unless the 2020 presidential election is\u00a0a landslide for either\u00a0President Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden, results will likely not be clear until days -- or even weeks --\u00a0after\u00a0Nov. 3. \"Although ... factors may complicate plaintiffs\u2019 voting process, they do not automatically amount to a loss of the right to vote absentee,\"\u00a0the court said in its decision. Hundreds of special absentee-ballot voting boxes have been set up across the state. Initially, Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens had ruled that ballots postmarked by\u00a0Nov. 2 can still be counted if they are received two weeks after Nov. 3, citing\u00a0\"unrefuted evidence\"\u00a0about mail delivery problems because of the coronavirus pandemic. She said more than 6,400 ballots arrived too late to be counted in the August primary.

CASE AGAINST WHITMER KIDNAPPING SUSPECTS CAN MOVE TO TRIAL, JUDGE RULES Some legislators\u00a0feared that changes\u00a0to the U.S. Postal Service put in place by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy months before the election could potentially delay delivery service and, therefore, ballot-counting processes. DeJoy assured voters in an Aug. 18 statement that the USPS \"is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall.\" He\u00a0has since postponed the changes. \u201cHappy to see this unanimous ruling to uphold the integrity of our elections process and reject judicial overreach,\u201d Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey tweeted. The Michigan Democratic Party was disappointed. \u201cVoters should not be punished for delays in the U.S. Postal Service or for unexpected emergencies that could make it a challenge for them to get to the polls on Election Day,\u201d the party said.

Less than 24 hours until Election Day, the Trump and Biden campaigns are winding down their rigorous battles fought via ad campaigns, debates\u00a0and rallies, while digging in for a whole new war, this one to be waged in courtrooms. Both sides have amassed their battalions of attorneys, and it appears that they will not wait long to engage. FEDERAL COURT TO HEAR REPUBLICAN BID TO TOSS 127,000 BALLOTS IN TEXAS \u201cWe're going to go in [the] night of, as soon as that election is over, we're going in with our lawyers,\u201d President Trump told reporters\u00a0Sunday, referring to litigation over whether ballots in swing states such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina should be counted if they arrive in the mail after Election Day. \"I don't think it's fair that we have to wait a long period of time after the election. Should've gotten their ballots in a long time before that. Could've gotten their ballots in a month ago. I think it's a ridiculous decision,\u201d the president said, referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to block state court orders that allowed extensions. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said Sunday that she expects the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of ballots to be tallied in a few days\u2019 time, but whether all of those votes will ultimately count will depend on how the ongoing court case plays out. She confirmed that ballots received after Election Day will be segregated from the rest, just in case they are ruled invalid. To handle this and other legal matters, Trump\u2019s campaign has formed what it has called \u201cLawyers for Trump,\u201d a coalition to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of the election. The coalition is being led by Texas\u00a0Attorney General Ken Paxton and Arkansas\u00a0Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, as well as California\u00a0Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon and former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino.

PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS IT WILL TAKE 'DAYS' TO COUNT 'OVERWHELMING MAJORITY' OF VOTES The Lawyers for Trump coalition comes as part of the joint Republican National Committee and Trump campaign's \"Protect the Vote\" effort, which has warned for months that \"Democrats are trying to use coronavirus and the courts to legalize ballot harvesting, implement a nationwide mail-in ballot system, and eliminate nearly every safeguard in our elections.\" John Hansberry, with the Philadelphia City Commissioners office, demonstrates an extraction machine at the city's mail-in ballot sorting and counting center in preparation for the 2020 General Election in the United States, Monday, Oct. 26, 2020, in Philadelphia.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN SUES IN NEVADA TO STOP VEGAS-AREA VOTE COUNT The campaign said this team includes Bob Bauer, who has signed on\u00a0full-time as a senior campaign adviser while\u00a0on leave from the faculty of NYU Law School. Bauer, who served as general counsel to the Obama-Biden campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and co-chair of former President Obama's Presidential Commission on Election Administration, will work alongside the campaign\u2019s general counsel, Dana Remus. Remus has oversight of the campaign\u2019s day-to-day legal operations, and will oversee the wide-ranging team of lawyers to address voter protection. A national team for special litigation features former Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger, and a team at the law firm Perkins Coie, which is headed by Marc Elias. Perkins Coie played a key role in Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, and it was Elias who Fusion GPS, the firm that conducted opposition research that ultimately included Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier. The Biden team's lawyers will focus state-by-state on protecting voter access to the polls and a \u201cfair and accurate vote count.\u201d Democrats and Republicans are each claiming the other side is looking to rig the 2020 election in their favor, with accusations largely stemming from mail-in voting, which is being utilized to an unprecedented degree as a precaution to allow voters to avoid crowds during the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats claim that by opposing special measures to accommodate large-scale mail-in voting, Republicans are looking to disenfranchise American voters. As long as they submit their votes by Election Day, their votes should count, even if they do not arrive until several days later, they argue. MAINE COURT CITES VOTER FRAUD CONCERN IN RULING AGAINST PUSH FOR BALLOT HARVESTING, ABSENTEE EXTENSION Boockvar noted that it would be nothing new to have ballots counted after Election Day, as military votes are normally not received until days later. States have different deadlines for when service members\u2019 ballots must be received. According to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, Pennsylvania ballots must be signed by voters by 11:59 p.m. Monday, the day before Election Day, and arrive no later than 5 p.m. on the seventh day after Election Day. For civilian voters in Pennsylvania, the law had been that the state Board of Elections ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Democrats challenged this, seeking an injunction to allow ballots to be accepted up to three days later, as long as they are postmarked by Nov.\u00a03. They claimed that this was necessary because during this year\u2019s primary election, \u201cat least tens of thousands of voters ultimately did not receive their ballots with enough time to return them by the close of the polls on Election Day.\u201d The State Supreme Court granted the extension, leading Republicans to seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that it is up to the legislature, not the court, to set election rules. The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to take up the case, but they denied a request to put the state court\u2019s ruling on hold. A similar case is being litigated in North Carolina, where the deadline has been pushed to a week after Election Day. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are trying to change existing rules for their benefit. Trump has claimed that large-scale mail-in voting is not as secure as in-person, and leaves the system open to fraud. While clear cases of fraudulent behavior have yet to be proven thus far, the system has shown to be problematic in some instances, such as when more than 100 undelivered absentee ballots were found in a Kentucky dumpster. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP While Pennsylvania sided with Democrats, courts in states like Maine have denied pushes to extend ballot deadlines. \u201cA judicial declaration that the statutory deadline is not really a deadline at all, and can be altered and extended for a week or more, risks undermining voter confidence that the law means what it says and that the voting and the election are over,\u201d Maine Superior Court Justice William Stokes wrote in an order.

            "article_content": "New concerns over mail-in voting ahead of Election Day, Laura Ingle reports The Pennsylvania Democratic Party and\u00a0Democratic Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar argued in Monday filings with the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0that it\u00a0should deny requests by the Pennsylvania Republican Party and Republican state legislators to invalidate a three-day extension of the deadline for absentee ballots to be received by elections boards that was put in place by the Pennsylvania\u00a0Supreme Court. The state Democratic Party called Republicans' arguments for the U.S. Supreme Court to step in \"wrong under the law and dangerous for the Court as an institution.\" After the state court's ruling last month, absentee ballots in Pennsylvania still must be mailed by Election Day, but they can be delivered up to three days after that time. The ruling was made in response arguments by the state Democratic Party that with potential mail delays and a crush of expected absentee ballots in the state, a hard Election Day deadline for ballots to get to their destination could disenfranchise voters. Pennsylvania Democrats'... by Fox News PA. REPUBLICANS ASK SUPREME COURT TO STAY RULING THAT ALLOWS STATE TO ACCEPT BALLOTS 3 DAYS AFTER ELECTION Republicans, in appealing the ruling, say that by stepping into the case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the U.S. Constitution and federal election law and could potentially cause confusion and\u00a0delays in delivering an accurate election result. \"The irreparable harm in this case is immediate and palpable: The Supreme Court of PA's decision blatantly usurps the power of the PA General Assembly and inflicts confusion and chaos on the Commonwealth\u2019s upcoming federal elections,\" Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, who is one of the legislators who filed the application to bring the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a tweet. The state Democratic Party, on the other hand, argues that documented U.S. Postal Service delays, along with the extreme circumstances of the pandemic, mean the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was justified in implementing a\u00a0deadline extension\u00a0to ensure all votes are counted.\u00a0It says the U.S. Supreme Court should grant certiorari -- meaning it accepts the case -- and then summarily reject the Republicans' arguments in order to foreclose any further legal action on Pennsylvania's ballot deadlines just less than a month before the election. PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICANS PROPOSE 'ELECTION INTEGRITY' COMMITTEE AMID VOTING CONCERNS \"Otherwise, many thousands of voters who have relied on the current guidance from state election officials may be disenfranchised through no fault of their own,\" the state Democratic Party said.\u00a0Boockvar made a different argument, saying that the U.S. Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to review the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interpretation of its own constitution, so\u00a0the U.S. Supreme Court should simply deny any review in the case and let the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling stand. The state Democrats also panned\u00a0Republicans' warnings that accepting ballots that arrive after Election Day could potentially mean ballots cast after Nov. 3 would be counted. They said\u00a0counting such ballots is standard practice around the country and that by only counting ballots that arrive up to three days after the election there is a small chance any incorrectly mailed votes will be counted. In fact, the state Democratic Party argues, it would be extraordinarily difficult under the rules established by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for a ballot cast after the election to be counted. A voter would need to break clear law; ensure a postmark is not left on the ballot, which the voter does not control; ensure the ballot arrives in the mail within one or two days despite warnings of Post Office delays; and avoid being ruled against if their ballot is challenged. \"Indeed, there would be no reason to\u00a0even try to cheat the system considering the common expectation that every ballot will have a postmark or other proof of mailing,\" the Democrats said. \"For [Republicans'] hypothetical late-voting to occur, an unscrupulous voter would have to wait until after Election Day, commit a third-degree felony by lying on the Voter\u2019s Declaration, and bribe a postal employee not to postmark the envelope,\" Boockvar's filing\u00a0added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And in response to GOP arguments that state legislatures -- not state courts -- are the only bodies permitted to make election law, the state Democrats argue that the Supreme Court should \"not second-guess how state courts of last resort interpret their own law.\" The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, claiming jurisdiction in the extraordinary circumstance of the pandemic and huge increases of absentee ballot requests, effectively changed laws that were previously passed by the legislature establishing certain deadlines for absentee ballots. But Democrats say this is a legitimate role for the court because that power comes from the state's constitution and \"[t]he Pennsylvania General Assembly, like every other state legislature, enacts legislation against the backdrop of its constitution.\" The state Republicans' request for a stay in the case went to Justice Samuel Alito based on geography alone. He can decide whether to grant the stay on his own or he can refer it to the full court to decide.",

Greg Abbott's order limiting the number of ballot drop box locations to one per county, a policy that will mostly affect the state's largest \u2013\u00a0and more heavily Democratic \u2013\u00a0counties. \u201cThe governor\u2019s October proclamation provides Texas voters more ways to vote in the Nov.\u00a03 election than does the election code,\" the all-Republican court wrote in its 17-page ruling. \"It does not disenfranchise anyone.\" The order faced\u00a0three legal challenges from civil rights groups and Democrats\u00a0alleging that it\u00a0exceeds Abbott's\u00a0authority and\u00a0\"imposes an unconstitutional right on voters' right to vote,\" particularly in geographically large areas. TEXAS JUDGE ISSUES HALT ON GOVERNOR'S ORDER LIMITING ONE BALLOT DROP-OFF LOCATION PER COUNTY But the Texas Supreme Court disagreed, arguing that voters have other ways to cast\u00a0their ballot without relying on the drop-off boxes. \"The plaintiffs complain that limiting early hand deliveries of mail-in ballots to one office per county requires more travel time for some voters. But this ignores the other options for casting their ballots that these voters have,\"\u00a0the opinion said. The court noted that Texans can vote early for an expanded period; drop off their mail-in ballot in a 40-day window before the election rather than just on Nov. 3; and mail in their ballots. Tuesday's ruling, which overturned a lower court's decision to issue an injunction on Abbott's order,\u00a0is expected to be the final outcome in the matter. A state appeals court reinstated the order two weeks ago, siding with Abbott in the\u00a0ruling. NEVADA U.S. ATTORNEY ANNOUNCES 'DISTRICT ELECTION OFFICER' TO HANDLE GROWING CONCERNS OF ELECTION FRAUD Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton applauded the court's decision, saying it had \"stopped the district court's unlawful injunction and preserved election integrity.\" \"The 2020 general election is already underway and the integrity of our election process must be protected and preserved,\" Paxton said. \"Gov.\u00a0Abbott\u2019s order rightfully bolsters the security of dropped-off ballots. The Texas Supreme Court correctly stopped the district court\u2019s unlawful injunction and preserved election integrity.\" Texas allows voters to cast an absentee ballot if they are over the age of 65,\u00a0have an illness or disability,\u00a0will be out of the country for early voting or Election Day,\u00a0or are in jail but otherwise eligible to vote.

Lisa Murkowski said Tuesday that she cannot rule out voting to confirm a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court, just days after she voiced opposition for filling the vacancy so close to an election. \u201cI know everybody wants to ask the question, \u2018Will you confirm the nominee?\u2019\u201d she told reporters outside the Capitol.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t have a nominee yet. You and I don\u2019t know who that is. And so I can\u2019t confirm whether or not I can confirm a nominee when I don\u2019t know who the nominee is.\u201d The Alaska senator said on Sunday that her position \u201chas not changed\u201d after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and she \u201cwould not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election.\u201d TRUMP TAKES SWIPE AT MURKOWSKI AFTER SHE OPPOSES SENATE TAKING UP SCOTUS NOMINATION \u201cSadly, what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not support taking up a nomination eight months before the 2016 election to fill the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Scalia.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are now even closer to the 2020 election \u2014 less than two months out \u2014 and I believe the same standard must apply.\u201d Murkowski said Tuesday she still opposes a Senate confirmation vote so close to an election, but that decision is not up to her. \u201cI do not support this process moving forward,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, having said that, this process is moving forward with or without me.\u201d Murkowski suggested she may use her vote to protest the speed of the confirmation process if necessary. \u201cIf I had felt that there was a rush to move this through because you\u2019re up against a deadline that is hard and fast, like an election, and that a nominee had not been thoroughly and fairly evaluated through our process, then I\u2019m going to have to look at that,\u201d she said.

There\u00a0are strict constructionists, but who knew Chief Justice John Roberts was a\u00a0strict federalist? That is one takeaway from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Monday night, rendered as Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination was being\u00a0approved by the Senate. In a 5\u20133 decision, the Court declined to endorse a federal district judge\u2019s rewrite of Wisconsin State election law. This time, the chief justice joined the Court\u2019s four conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 leaving the three liberals in the minority, with Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor). This was in marked contrast to the Court\u2019s 4\u20134 deadlock a week earlier in a Pennsylvania election-law case, where a state court\u2019s rewrite of the state\u2019s election law was\u00a0permitted\u00a0to\u00a0stand\u00a0because Roberts joined the three liberals. (See my earlier\u00a0column\u00a0on the Pennsylvania and Wisconsin cases.) CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The new case is\u00a0Democratic National Committee v. Wisconsin State Legislature.\u00a0The Court\u2019s ruling prevents a federal judge from forcing the state to extend for six days following the November 3 election the deadline for receiving ballots (i.e., ballots would be counted until November 9, as long as they were postmarked on or before Election Day). This is very similar to what happened in the Pennsylvania case, where the state supreme court altered the deadlines. In his concurrence, however, Roberts invokes the primacy of state sovereignty in contending that the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania situations are different.

            "article_content": "National Journal politics editor Josh Kraushaar joins 'The Daily Briefing' with analysis A new TV commercial by President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign touts that the president is\u00a0\u201cthe clear choice\u201d for seniors, who are a key voting bloc in many of the battleground states that will decide the winner of the presidential election. The ads running on the airwaves\u00a0in Florida\u00a0and other crucial swing states as the president courted voters 65 and older on Friday during a stop in Fort Myers in southwest Florida. \"I am honored to be here in Fort Myers to reaffirm my solemn pledge to America\u2019s Seniors: I will protect you, I will defend you, and I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have,\" the president told the crowd. And he vowed to keep seniors safe from the coronavirus pandemic, promising that he was \"working as hard as I can\" so that they \"can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon.\" Senoirs make up roughtly 20% of the population in Florida, which with 29 electoral votes up for grabs is the largest of the traditional battlegrounds. BIDEN CHARGES THAT TRUMP SEES SENIORS AS 'EXPENDABLE' The president\u2019s stop came three days after Democratic nominee Joe Biden visited Florida and told a crowd of seniors that Trump views them as \u201cexpendable, forgettable.\u201d And the president\u2019s trip comes as Trump is trying to avoid becoming the first Republican presidential nominee in two decades to lose the 65 and older vote. Former Vice President Al Gore \u2013 who in the 2000 election repeatedly emphasized that he would keep Social Security \u201cin a lockbox\u201d \u2013 was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the senior vote. President Donald Trump speaks during an event on \"Protecting America's Seniors,\" Friday, Oct. 16, 2020, in Fort Myers, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Four years ago Trump captured the national vote of those 65 and older by a 52%-45% margin over Clinton, according to exit polls. But fast forward four years and the latest Fox News national poll indicates Biden with a slight 49%-47% edge over the president among seniors. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News national poll released this week showed a larger 54%-44% margin for Biden among voters 65 and older. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL SHOWS IN THE BIDEN-TRUMP SHOWDOWN One key reason may be the coronavirus pandemic, which is tied to the deaths of nearly 220,000 Americans and has hit seniors particularly hard. \u201cSeniors are much more impacted by the coronavirus, by their concern about getting it, their concern about what happens if they do get. They\u2019re much more sensitive to it because they\u2019re in the population is most at risk,\u201d noted longtime Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on coronavirus and the president\u2019s numbers on coronavirus are not strong. Voters generally disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing handling the issue.\u201d Biden, during a stop Tuesday in heavily populated Broward County in southeast Florida, pointed to comments Trump made last month in Swanton, Ohio, when he argued that the coronavirus \"affects virtually nobody\" except seniors. \"It affects elderly people, elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that's what it really affects, that's it,\" the president said at the time. \u201cNobody,\u201d Biden said on Tuesday. \u201cThink about that. Who was he talking about when he said it affects virtually nobody. He was talking about America\u2019s seniors. He was talking about you.\u201d And speaking directly to voters age 65 and older, the former vice president argued that Trump thinks \u201cyou\u2019re expendable, 'forgettable, you\u2019re virtually nobody. That\u2019s how he sees seniors. ... The only senior that Donald Trump cares about \u2026 is the senior Donald Trump.\" Biden also claimed the president will \u201cundermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out of pocket costs for seniors.\u201d And he charged that Trump \u201csays he wants to lower drug prices, but he hasn\u2019t done a single thing to do it.\u201d The Trump campaign fired back, arguing that \u201cBiden resorted to his worn tactic of lying about President Trump, who has steadfastly protected Social Security and Medicare and who has pledged to always do so.\u201d HOW PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED IN THE 2020 ELECTION Last week, as he was recovering at the White House after being diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, tweeted that seniors are \u201cMY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!\u201d And the announcer in the new Trump campaign commercial highlights that \u201cPresident Trump protected Social Security and Medicare\u201d and that Trump \u201clowered drug costs and during his first term Medicare Advantage premiums fell 34%.\u201d Four years ago Trump narrowly edged out 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Florida. An average of some of the most recent polling in the state shows Biden holding a single-digit lead over the president. In a sign of how important the state is to the president\u2019s reelection, Trump\u2019s spent three days campaigning in the state this week. \u201cSeniors in Florida are critical to winning the state,\u201d noted Newhouse, who was Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s pollster in the 2012 presidential campaign. \u201cThe key voter groups in the state would be seniors and Hispanics. A strong performance among seniors would go a long way towards giving the president an edge in the state.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Florida. Seniors make up at least 17% of the population in the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa\u00a0and New Hampshire. The concentration by the two standard-bearers on seniors this week is welcome news to many. With America dealing with the most devastating pandemic in a century, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression more than 80 years ago, the most intense and widespread protests and unrest over racial inequity in decades, and arguably the most bitter U.S. Supreme Court confirmation battle in recent history, it\u2019s little wonder that some issues critical to seniors that usually dominate presidential elections have been pushed to the side in recent months. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned that our issues have been overshadowed because when these things pass \u2013 and they will pass \u2013 the fundamental bedrock issues for Americans- things like their health, taking care of aging parents, Medicare, prescription drug prices, Social Security \u2013 those things are still going to be with us,\u201d AARP New Hampshire state director Todd Fahey told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the voters understand where each candidate stands on these singularly important issues,\u201d Fahey emphasized. \u201cThey are of great important to the nation and the candidates need to speak to all of them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Jay Sekulow lauds Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 'she was brilliant lawyer, advocate and justice. 'She made real history.' The 2016 presidential election happened as a seat on the Supreme Court was at stake following the death of a justice\u00a0-- that will be the case yet again in 2020 after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the face of the liberal bloc on the Supreme Court and a trailblazer for women's rights, died on Friday. In 2016, the vacancy was for Justice Antonin Scalia's seat, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., used his caucus' numbers\u00a0to hold the seat open until after the presidential election, saying\u00a0Americans should have a say in who chooses Scalia's successor. That led to the confirmation of Trump nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch. Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the time told Republicans \"to do their job\" and give then-President Barack Obama nominee Merrick Garland\u00a0\"full and fair consideration.\" SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG DEAD AT 87 Now in 2020 the roles are reversed. McConnell has indicated that he intends to have the Senate vote on a nominee from President Trump. Feinstein said that \"under no circumstances\" should the vacancy opened by Ginsburg's death be filled before the January inauguration. Feinstein argues things are the same now as they were in 2016. \"Merrick Garland was nominated to fill Scalia\u2019s seat on March 16, 2016 \u2013 237 days before the presidential election. Today, we\u2019re just 46 days away from an election,\" she said in a statement Friday.\u00a0\"To jam through a lifetime appointment to the country\u2019s highest court \u2013 particularly to replace an icon like Justice Ginsburg \u2013 would be the height of hypocrisy.\" TOP JUDICIARY DEM FEINSTEIN: RBG SUCCESSOR SHOULD 'UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES' BE CONFIRMED BEFORE INAUGURATION' McConnell says\u00a0things are different. \"In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term,\" the majority leader said. \"We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.\" He added: \"By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.\" McConnell and Feinstein are fundamentally aiming to ensure the next justice the Senate confirms is nominated by a president from their party. But their arguments for whether precedent is on their side -- and about who is acting hypocritically --\u00a0are likely to take center stage in the next few months. And the pair of powerful senators are far from the only ones apparently changing their tunes from 2016. Another is Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the Republican whip in the Senate. He said in 2016 that the Republican Senate \"was elected to be a check and balance on President Obama.\u00a0The American people deserve to have their voices heard on the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice, who could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court for a generation. Since the next presidential election is already underway, the next president should make this lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\" On Friday Thune said: \"While tonight the nation rightly mourns, we\u2019ll soon turn to the Senate\u2019s constitutional role in this process. I believe Americans sent a Republican president and a Republican Senate to Washington to ensure we have an impartial judiciary that upholds the Constitution and the rule of law.\u00a0We will fulfill our obligation to them.\u00a0As Leader McConnell has said, President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., changed his tune as well. \"Garland has integrity, a brilliant legal mind & is a perfect fit for #SCOTUS,\" he tweeted in 2016. \"GOP inaction does our country a great disservice. #DoYourJob.\" WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL DID IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF JUSTICE SCALIA'S DEATH Schumer on Friday, however,\u00a0said that the vacancy created by Ginsburg's passing shouldn't be filled until there is \"another president,\" likely meaning the Senate should not act until after the January presidential inauguration. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" he said. Others have changed their attitudes as well, but at least one senator has already doubled down on the same position she held in 2016. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, a moderate and a swing vote on many judicial nominations, said before Ginsburg's death that she would not support action on a Supreme Court nomination before the presidential election. \"I would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50 some days away from an election,\" she told\u00a0Alaska Public Media. That statement matches her 2016 stance that a justice should not be confirmed before the election. \"[G]iven the timing of this vacancy, in the middle of a Presidential election and in an increasingly toxic political environment, I had urged the President to refrain from naming a nominee,\" Murkowski said in 2016. \"I believe he should have left that task to the next administration. Vice President Joe Biden, during his time in the Senate, advised that consideration of a Supreme Court nominee should be put off until after the election is over, because the thoughtful consideration that a Supreme Court nominee deserves simply cannot occur at the height of a political season.\u00a0I find a great deal of wisdom in those words, because in my judgment they accurately describe what is already happening with regard to this election-year nomination.\" Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was one of the few Republicans in 2016 to say that the Senate should consider Garland. \u201cThe meeting left me more convinced than ever that the process should proceed. The next step, in my view, should be public hearings,\" she said. Collins on Friday did not indicate her thoughts on whether the Senate should process a Trump nominee. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Notably silent on the issue of whether or not there should be a vote on a replacement for Ginsburg as of Friday evening, however, are multiple Republican senators who\u00a0are currently up for reelection in competitive races and in 2016 said that the Senate should wait until after the presidential election to confirm a nominee. Among these are Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Cory Gardner, R-Colo.; Steve Daines, R-Montana; and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The Supreme Court vacancy, which if filled by Trump, has the potential to fundamentally alter the balance of the court, is likely to spur tens of millions of dollars in political spending and will alter the complexion of the presidential election and many Senate races.

            "article_content": "President Trump discusses conducting 'massive rallies' and Election Day on 'Fox Friends.' LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and Nevada Republicans filed notice Monday that they\u2019ll ask the state Supreme Court to stop the count of mail-in ballots in Clark County, the state\u2019s most populous and Democratic-leaning county, including Las Vegas. On the eve of the presidential election in a battleground state with six electoral votes at stake, the campaign and party notified a state judge that his refusal to halt Las Vegas-area ballot counting will get a fast-track appeal. The Trump camp and state GOP also lost a bid in a separate public records lawsuit in Las Vegas to force the Clark County Registrar of Voters to turn over names of ballot workers handling the nearly 400,000 mail-in ballots received so far in Clark County. Registrar Joe Gloria rejected that request Oct. 21 citing \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d He testified Monday he was concerned that the 300 temporary workers hired for the Nov. 3 election could face pressure or intimidation if their names were made public. WILL A WINNER BE ANNOUNCED ON ELECTION NIGHT? Gloria also told the judge that on his request, law enforcers have been following trucks that transport ballots from place to place. \u201cValid security concerns relate to information about employees (and) contractors,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez decided. She said officials can turn over lists of workers\u2019 names after the election is complete and certified Nov. 16. She set a Nov. 20 compliance date. County employees process mail-in ballots at a Clark County election department facility Saturday, Oct. 31, 2020, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher) The legal actions surrounding votes in Las Vegas come as the Trump campaign and state Republicans try to swing Nevada from the Democratic column, where it went in 2016 when state voters narrowly backed Hillary Clinton. Arguments about access and oversight have emerged in several battleground states following calls from the president for his supporters to closely monitor ballot counts. FULL LIST: POLL CLOSING TIMES IN EVERY STATE In Nevada, Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to suppress voting in the state\u2019s most diverse area. Clark County, including Las Vegas, is more than 31% Hispanic, 13% Black and about 10% Asian American, according to the U.S. Census. \u201cTrump and his allies are attacking our election processes because they do not want to hear from the hardworking people of our state,\u201d a Democratic party statement said. Democrats point also to an earlier GOP and Trump campaign lawsuit \u2014 dismissed by a federal judge in September \u2014 that sought to invalidate a state law that invoked the coronavirus pandemic and enabled universal mail-in voting statewide. In the ballot-count ruling, Judge James Wilson Jr. in Carson City acknowledged the law enacted by the majority-Democratic Legislature last summer allows challenges of in-person votes, but not of mailed-in ballots. But, he said: \u201cNothing the state or Clark County has done values one voter\u2019s vote over another\u2019s.\u201d Trump campaign and state Republican party attorney Jesse Binnall pleaded with Wilson last Wednesday for \u201ctransparency;\u201d cited testimony from campaign count-watchers who said ballots were sometimes removed from their view; and asked to stop the count until officials allow \u201cmeaningful\u201d oversight and ballot challenges. BLUE STATE SEES LARGEST VOTER TURNOUT SO FAR, WITH MORE THAN 11.2M BALLOTS CAST Binnall did not criticize ballot processing in Nevada\u2019s other 16 counties, where Republicans outnumber Democrats in active voter rolls. Wilson also rejected Binnall\u2019s bids for a court order to stop use of an optical scanning machine to validate voter signatures, and to let the GOP install cameras to monitor counting. Gloria testified that observers from both major parties and non-partisans are being accommodated in Las Vegas-area ballot-counting offices. Privacy requirements prevent over-the-shoulder monitoring of signature validation, he said. Under pandemic rules, ballots were mailed to all active registered voters in Nevada. Clark County has almost 71% of all voters statewide, according to October tallies. Democrats make up almost 41% of registered active voters in the Las Vegas area, and Republicans account for 28.6%. More than 1.27 million ballots went out in Clark County and more than 398,000 were received as of Monday, state election data said. More than 98% of those were accepted as valid.

            "article_content": "<br> We all knew Election Day 2020 wouldn\u2019t be normal. And yet it still seems remarkable that we don\u2019t know yet who will be the president of the United States on Jan. 20. And we may not know for some time if we\u2019ll have four more years of President Trump or a newly inaugurated President Joe Biden. Even if news organizations declare a winner in the close presidential race, that\u2019s not the official result. States have until Dec. 8 to settle any election disputes and certify their results before the meeting of state electors in every state Dec. 14, when they cast their Electoral College votes for president. JOHN YOO: TRUMP-BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL RACE COULD BE DECIDED BY PENNSYLVANIA CASE BEFORE SUPREME COURT While knowing who won a presidential election usually doesn\u2019t take this long, it isn\u2019t unprecedented if it does. Think back to Bush v. Gore. There, the race between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore wasn\u2019t decided until December, when the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in to end any further vote recounts in Florida because of the mistakes made by state courts and election officials. Everyone hopes it won\u2019t come to that again, but election-related litigation is already underway at a dizzying pace and could play a key role in deciding what has morphed into an incredibly tight race. Here\u2019s a look at legal fights in key states. Pennsylvania The litigation in Pennsylvania started well before Election Day. An evenly divided U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 and left in place a ruling by Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court requiring officials to count absentee ballots received by Friday Nov. 6. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had also ruled that state officials could not reject late-received ballots unless they could produce evidence that the ballot was mailed after Election Day \u2014 and that they could not reject ballots due to mismatched voter signatures. That\u2019s a basic ballot integrity procedure used in many jurisdictions. The U.S. Supreme Court also declined a subsequent request to rule on the merits of the dispute before the election, and may now have put itself in the unenviable position of ruling on the merits of the dispute after the election \u2014 which could, in effect, decide the outcome. Presumably recognizing this fact, President Trump\u2019s campaign filed a motion Wednesday to intervene in the case. Still, that\u2019s not the only pending litigation in Pennsylvania. It gets messy, so hold on. Also on Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit seeking to allow observers to be close enough to actually observe the counting of ballots in Philadelphia. A Pennsylvania state trial court rejected the request, but the next day, a Pennsylvania appellate court reversed the ruling. The appeals court said that \u201ceffective immediately \u2026 all candidates, watchers, or candidate representatives [shall] be permitted to be present for the canvassing process \u2026 and be permitted to observe all aspects of the canvassing process within 6 feet, while adhering to all COVID-19 protocols, including, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.\u201d The Philadelphia Board of Elections filed an emergency petition that same day (Thursday) with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, asking it to overturn the appellate court\u2019s decision. The petition remains pending there. But that\u2019s not the end of this particular saga. After the Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court issued its order, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Philadelphia claiming that the Board of Elections is \u201cnonetheless continuing to count ballots, without any observations by any representatives or poll watchers of President Trump and the Republican Party.\u201d Clearly, this issue remains to be resolved, given that Philadelphia is apparently refusing to comply with the court order. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee also filed a lawsuit where they argued that the Pennsylvania secretary of state wrongly extended the deadline from Nov. 9 to Nov. 12 for absentee and mail-in voters to provide missing proof of identification. A Pennsylvania state court judge ordered that \u201cthe county boards of elections shall segregate ballots for which identification is received and verified on November 10, 11, and 12, 2020, from ballots for which identification is received and verified on or before November 9, 2020,\u201d pending resolution of the matter. Republican candidates and officials also filed a lawsuit challenging Montgomery County officials\u2019 decision to notify voters whose ballots are defective and giving them a chance to \u201ccure\u201d the defects \u2014 something not authorized under state law. Other outside groups, such as the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), have also filed lawsuits. PILF specifically filed a suit against the Pennsylvania Department of State for failing to maintain accurate voter rolls and remove individuals who have died, moved out of state, or otherwise become ineligible to vote. Georgia and Michigan President Trump\u2019s campaign lost legal challenges in both Georgia and Michigan on Thursday. In Georgia, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit after a GOP observer said he had observed Chatham County (Savannah) election officials comingling late ballots with on-time ballots. Absentee ballots in Georgia must be received by the end of Election Day. After hearing testimony from both sides of the dispute, a Georgia state court judge dismissed the case. In Michigan, like in Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign filed a suit against the secretary of state asking to be allowed to \u201cmeaningfully participate and oversee\u201d the vote-counting process. However, because the vote counting, done primarily by local officials, had already been completed, the judge denied the request. She said that in her view, there was no meaningful relief left to provide. Other claims were also raised in Georgia and rejected. What is unexplained is why election officials refused to comply with a state law that requires qualified poll watchers to be able to observe every aspect of the voting and ballot-counting process. Just like in Philadelphia, one has to wonder \u2014 what were they trying to hide? Nevada The Trump campaign has also teased, but hasn\u2019t yet filed, a lawsuit in Nevada where it alleges that many ineligible voters \u2014 some deceased, some non-residents \u2014 cast votes. The significant problems with Nevada\u2019s voter rolls have been well documented, including by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which recently produced a video showing voters illegally registered at commercial businesses such as casinos and pawn shops, as well as vacant lots. Arizona In Arizona, the Public Interest Legal Foundation has also filed a lawsuit against Maricopa County on behalf of voters who claim they were unable to cast a ballot due to errors by election officials. They allege they were given Sharpies to complete their ballots, even though the computer scanners used with opti-scan paper ballots cannot process such ballots. Now What? Clearly, this election has generated significant litigation. We can\u2019t help but wonder if a lot of it could have been avoided if election officials had heeded our warnings about the dangers of mail-in voting and changing election procedures too close to an election without their state legislature\u2019s approval. We might also have avoided some of these problems if election officials had complied with their state laws guaranteeing candidates and political parties complete access to the process. Failure to do so damages the transparency essential to maintaining public confidence in the integrity of elections. Two things should be kept in mind. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER First, gathering the evidence of misconduct, fraud and other problems that may have compromised an election is extremely difficult and expensive. As an Indiana state court pointed out in an election fraud case in 2004, \u201cthe time constraints that govern election contests, primarily designed to serve important interests and needs of election officials and the public interest in finality, simply do not work well in those elections where misconduct\u201d is widespread and multifaceted. Second, courts are usually very reluctant to overturn election results even with substantial evidence of possible problems that raise questions about the legitimacy of the outcome. Thus, no matter what the merits are of the claims being made by the Trump campaign, they face an uphill battle in the courts. Here\u2019s what\u2019s clear at this point: Every legally cast ballot should count and be counted. Those that were not legally cast should not. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hopefully, this litigation will be a reminder that clear election rules established by state legislatures well before an election can avoid delays and problems after an election. The same is true if election officials comply with the law instead of defying it.

            "article_content": "Undecided Wisconsin voters join 'The Story with Martha MacCallum' to weigh in on the 2020 presidential election. Handing a momentary victory for Republicans and President Trump in a state expected to play a major role in this year\u2019s presidential election, a federal appeals court on Sunday temporarily halted a six-day extension for counting absentee ballots in Wisconsin's presidential election. As it stands, ballots will now be due by 8 p.m. on Election Day. A lower court judge had sided with Democrats and their allies to extend the deadline until Nov. 9. Democrats sought more time as a way to help deal with an expected historic high number of absentee ballots. The Democratic National Committee, the state Democratic Party and allied groups including the League of Women Voters sued to extend the deadline for counting absentee ballots after the April presidential primary saw long lines, fewer polling places, a shortage of workers and thousands of ballots mailed days after the election. WISCONSIN APPEALS COURT DECISION, INSISTS ABSENTEE BALLOTS RECEIVED AFTER ELECTION DAY SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED U.S. District Judge William Conley ruled Sept. 21 that ballots that arrive up to six days after Election Day will count as long as they're postmarked by Election Day. Sunday\u2019s action puts Conley\u2019s order on hold until the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals or U.S. Supreme Court issues any further action. No further details were immediately posted by the appeals court. State election officials anticipate as many as 2 million people will cast absentee ballots to avoid catching the coronavirus at the polls. That would be three times more absentee ballots than any other previous election and could overwhelm both election officials and the postal service, Conley wrote. If the decision had stood it could have delayed knowing the winner of Wisconsin for days. The Republican National Committee, the state GOP and Wisconsin's Republican legislators argued that current absentee voting rules be left in place, saying people have plenty of time to obtain and return their ballots. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Conley in April had ruled that absentee ballots in the state's presidential election could be submitted up to six days after election day. The 7th Circuit let that decision stand but the U.S. Supreme Court said only ballots postmarked on or before election day would count. Conley on Sept. 21 also extended the state\u2019s deadline for registering by mail or electronically by seven days, from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21 and declared that poll workers can work in any county, not just where they live. Clerks have reported fears of the virus caused shortages of poll workers in both Wisconsin\u2019s spring presidential primary and state primary in August. Loosening the residency requirements could make it easier to fill slots. Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point \u2014 fewer than 23,000 votes \u2014 in 2016 and the state figures to be a key battleground again in 2020. Polls show Democrat Joe Biden with a slight lead but both sides expect a tight race. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Just days after\u00a0President Trump\u00a0nominated Judge\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett to fill the seat vacated after the death of\u00a0Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a\u00a0new Monmouth University poll found there to be a divide among\u00a0voters when it comes to a\u00a0president filling a vacant Supreme Court seat at the end of their term. The poll, which was released on Monday, showed\u00a047 percent approval for filling the seat, while 49 percent believe Trump should\u00a0put his nomination to the high court on hold\u00a0until after Election Day.

Republicans have continued to push the narrative that because the Senate and White House were controlled by different parties in 2016, it was the will of the people to have friction within the divided government. With the 2018 midterm elections increasing the GOP majority in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he felt justified in forging ahead with Barrett's nomination.

In the wake of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, Republican and Democratic leaders are facing fresh scrutiny for\u00a0stances they took regarding Supreme Court nominations in 2016 and 2020. Ginsburg's death immediately recalled how Republicans resisted a vote on former President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland while Democrats told the other side it was their job to confirm another justice. On Friday, Obama argued that the Senate should wait, citing the need for consistency. \"A basic principle of the law \u2014 and of everyday fairness \u2014 is that we apply rules with consistency, and not based on what\u2019s convenient or advantageous in the moment,\" he said. Former Vice President Joe Biden similarly said the Senate should wait, despite previously saying that blocking Garland could result in a \"constitutional crisis.\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., caught special criticism since he vehemently opposed Garland's nomination and even told Americans to use his own words against him. Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying he would be erecting a \"monument to hypocrisy\" if he pursued a vote on Trump's nominee. HILLARY CLINTON: QUICKLY FILLING RBG'S SEAT WOULD BE 'MONUMENT TO HYPOCRISY,' GREATEST TRAVESTY Each of them, however, appeared to argue that the cirumstances for 2020 were different, justifying a different opinion. \"Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president's Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year,\" McConnell said Friday. When McConnell opposed Garland in 2016, he also cited the \"Biden rule,\" an apparent reference to then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., arguing that the Senate should postpone confirming a nominee if one was offered by former President George H.W. Bush. Clinton, who browbeat Republicans in May 2016 to consider Garland, noting that he \"Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and on average confirmation or rejection has taken just two months.\" She also argued in February of that year that \"[t]he Senate has a constitutional responsibility here that it cannot abdicate for partisan political purposes.\" But on Friday, she told\u00a0MSNBC host Rachel Maddow that Democrats should oppose Trump's would-be nominee, citing McConnell's \"hypocrisy.\" She also said that voting McConnell out was the \"only way\" to remedy his \"den[ying]\" Obama's \"right\" to appoint a justice. McConnell and Graham have both argued that 2020 is different because the White House and Senate are\u00a0controlled by the same party. In a lengthy thread Saturday, writer Drew Holden called attention to multiple Democrats who offered apparently contradictory statements about Trump's and Obama's nominees. LINDSEY GRAHAM SIDES WITH TRUMP ON FILLING SUPREME COURT VACANCY: 'I FULLY UNDERSTAND' Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who previously told Republicans to do their \"job\" on Garland, said Democrats would do everything they could to prevent Republicans from \"steal[ing] another seat.\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., attempted to use McConnell's words against him while his colleague, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., warned that if Republicans \"go forward and reverse the precedent they set in 2016, the Senate will never, ever be the same.\" Both of them supported Garland's nomination in 2016.

            "article_content": "The Senate Judiciary Committee set to vote on nomination of Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 22. Just a little over 1 month ago and\u00a0mere hours after the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. announced that he would hold hearings and a vote to confirm her replacement, even though voting had already started in the general election. This decision ignored the precedent set in March of 2016 when Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination did not even receive a hearing after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on February 13 and McConnell himself said that voters should decide who fills the vacancy during an election year. Now, with more than 17 million ballots cast during early voting, the Senate Judiciary Committee has already completed its confirmation hearing for Trump\u2019s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, and set a date for a vote. Most Americans want the winner of the November election to appoint the next Supreme Court Justice, but President Trump has rushed this process with clear intentions: Overturn Roe vs Wade, cut health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions (including COVID-19 survivors), and confirm a ninth Justice so that he can challenge the 2020 election results in court. DAVID LIMBAUGH: AMY CONEY BARRETT IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE JUDICIAL ACTIVIST, SHE'S AN ORIGINALIST Since the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination, both President Trump and the Republican leadership have ignored concerns that she would overturn Roe, dismantle the ACA, and harm the LGBTQ community. But when we examine our recent past, and the effects that SCOTUS appointments have on our fundamental freedoms, those concerns become even more reasonable. After Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed two years ago, a flurry of laws restricting reproductive freedom rushed out of both state legislatures and the federal government. 2019 saw state legislatures pass the most restrictive, knowingly unconstitutional abortion bans since the 1970s, with the direct intention of inciting litigation that would bring Roe vs Wade before the Supreme Court. Just this year, the Court blocked access to birth control by allowing business owners to deny coverage for its employees, even though insurance coverage of birth control would not actually cost the employer more. This ruling leaves contraception financially out of reach for millions of people across the country. Coming out of last week\u2019s hearings, we know how Judge Barrett feels about reproductive freedom -- academically, personally, and as a sitting judge. Not only has Judge Barrett said that abortion is \u201cimmoral\u201d under any circumstances -- including instances of rape or inviable pregnancies -- but she has also ruled to limit or push access to abortion care completely out of reach on more than one occasion. She has also voiced support for organizations that believe fertility doctors who perform critical treatments like IVF should be prosecuted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER During Senator Feinstein's questioning, Judge Barrett strategically and intentionally refused to respond to questions on Roe. Instead, she pivoted to the 1992 Casey v Planned Parenthood case, allowing her to skirt the question and hide her intentions. These side-steps also gave a direct signal to the anti-choice base that she\u2019s most open to overturning the \u201cundue burden\u201d requirements established by Casey as a means to weaken the rights established by Roe. Judge Barrett made it clear: her preferred tactic in banning abortion is to encourage conservative lawmakers to intensify their efforts to chip away at access to reproductive health care by passing laws that close clinics and threaten providers. Pushing to eliminate reproductive freedom, despite its overwhelming support, is to ignore the will of the people and the reality of people\u2019s lives. Government control does not belong in these private moments. Most importantly, weakening or overturning Roe and limiting access to birth control certainly won\u2019t stop abortions from happening - it will just make them unsafe and dangerous. Let\u2019s not forget that the core tenet of Roe v Wade is the right to privacy. Outlawing the right to choose means that without Roe v. Wade, pregnant people and trained medical professionals will be subject to intense scrutiny and criminal investigation by law enforcement. For example, if the six-week abortion ban proposed in Georgia had been enacted, accidental miscarriages could be considered second-degree murder, punishable with up to 30 years in prison. This is an extreme overreach by the government into medical protocols and deeply personal decisions -- often in the most vulnerable and sometimes traumatic moments in families\u2019 lives. Politicians have no place in these private family matters. Health care access is foundational to all of this -- from birth control to maternal mortality, fertility treatments to abortion access. Especially during a global pandemic when COVID-19 survivors can be considered patients with pre-existing conditions, we need our government to focus on providing more access to health care, rather than rolling back our freedoms. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Personal health and family decisions should not require the permission of a governor, president, or any other politician, and it is unacceptable to threaten pregnant people with jail-time if their pregnancy ends. We each deserve the right to decide if, when and how we grow our families. In the words of 2016 Mitch McConnell, \u201cLet the people decide.\u201d ",

Accordingly, I intend to follow the Constitution and precedent in considering the President\u2019s nominee. If the nominee reaches the Senate floor, I intend to vote based upon their qualifications.\u201d REPUBLICAN SENATORS FALL IN LINE TO BACK MOVING AHEAD WITH TRUMP SCOTUS PICK: 'WE'VE TO THE VOTES' Romney expanded on his logic in subsequent comments to the press on Tuesday. \"We may have a court that has a more conservative bent,\" than it has had in recent decades, Romney said after his announcement. \"But my liberal friends have over many decades gotten used to the idea of having a liberal court. And that's not written in the stars.\" He added: \"It's also appropriate for a nation that's if you will center-right to have a court which reflects\u00a0center-right points of view. Which again are not changing the law from what it states but\u00a0instead following the law and following the Constitution.\" Romney also said that the timing of a vote on a Trump nominee would not influence his decision-making, indicating that if the confirmation vote is delayed until after the presidential election, and Romney judges that the Trump Supreme Court nominee is qualified for the bench, that he would support nominee even if the Republican Senate and Trump are lame ducks.

            "article_content": "Democrats threaten court upheaval; reaction from Joe Concha, media reporter for The Hill. In the days leading up to the presidential election, one topic that has sparked much debate has been the Supreme Court. With\u00a0President Trump confirming his third justice, Democrats calling for expanding the court's roster if given the chance, and lawsuits that could potentially impact the election's results, both candidates have made\u00a0significant statements on the high court. President Trump President Trump's general stance regarding the makeup of the Supreme Court has been traditional, as he has vehemently opposed the idea of court packing\u00a0and has blasted Democrats for suggesting it. He has\u00a0appointed three conservatives jurists during his term in office:\u00a0Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0and Amy Coney Barrett. While all three were the subjects of bitterly partisan confirmation processes, all were recognized for their qualifications. TRUMP RIPS ABSENTEE BALLOT EXTENTIONS, SAYS ELECTION 'SHOULD END ON NOVEMBER 3RD' Recent orders from the court, however, have left Trump concerned about his reelection chances. The Supreme Court allowed ballot deadline extensions to stand in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, increasing the chances of the election's results remaining unknown for days after Nov.\u00a03. Trump expressed his frustration Friday night, and alluded to how the court could end up changing under a possible Joe Biden administration. Trump referenced the possibility of the Supreme Court being packed with an addition of liberal justices, or adopting a practice of revolving justices through the court should Biden win. Joe Biden The Democratic nominee has not been totally clear on what he would do if elected, but he has plainly stated that he believes the Supreme Court needs systemic change, telling CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that it was \"getting out of whack.\" While left-wing organizations and some Democratic lawmakers have pushed for court packing to negate the current 6-3 conservative majority on the court, former vice president Joe Biden refused to weigh in on the issue for a significant portion of his campaign. He repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether they are in favor of increasing the number of justices on the court. Biden finally said he was \"not a fan\" of the idea, which echoed what he had indicated during his primary campaign before the concept gained traction within his party. BIDEN RAISES IDEA OF ROTATING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: 'THERE IS SOME LITERATURE AMONG CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS' It would be difficult to pack the court even if Biden wanted to. First, he would need Congress to pass legislation to expand the court, which would only work if Democrats took control of the Senate and changed rules to eliminate the filibuster so they would only need 51 votes instead of 60. Then, he would have to confirm new justices, which has proven to have become a heavily partisan process. Instead, Biden has said he would call for a bipartisan commission to study how best to revamp the Supreme Court. One such idea has been to rotate justices through the Supreme Court and into other federal courts, which would require appointing new justices. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThere is some literature among constitutional scholars about the possibility of going from one court to another court, not just always staying the whole time in the Supreme Court but I have made no judgment,\" Biden\u00a0said\u00a0at a campaign stop in Chester, Penn. When asked if he would eliminate lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court, Biden said, \"I'm not going to attempt to change that at all.\" Fox News' Sam Dorman and Tyler Olson contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Bill McGurn of The Wall Street Journal discusses how Supreme Court changes could impact Roe v. Wade. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Mitch McConnell\u00a0on Tuesday, saying the majority leader has \u201cdefiled\u201d the Senate over Supreme Court vacancies and \u201cmay very well destroy it.\u201d During remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted President Trump and McConnell, R-Ky., for pushing to fill the vacancy on the high court left by late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the 2020 presidential election. TRUMP: SUPREME COURT PICK TO BE ANNOUNCED SATURDAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE \u201cYou would think that after the Republican majority led a historic blockade just four years ago to keep open a vacancy on the Supreme Court because it was an election year, they would have the honor and decency to apply their own rule when the same scenario came around again,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday. \u201cYou\u2019d expect this Senate majority to follow their own rule.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s fair is fair. This is what Leader McConnell said in 2016. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\u201d he continued. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the \u2018McConnell rule.'\u201d Schumer went on to slam McConnell, saying, \u201cturns out the \u2018McConnell rule\u2019 was nothing more than a \u2018McConnell ruse.\u2019\u201d \u201cLeader McConnell, sadly is headed down the path of breaking his word to the Senate and the American people,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHe has exposed once and for all that a supposed principle of giving the people a voice in selecting the next justice was a farce.\u201d \u201cSadly, Leader McConnell has defiled the Senate\u00a0like no one in this generation, and Leader McConnell may very well destroy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Leader McConnell presses forward, the Republican majority will have stolen two Supreme Court seats four years apart, using completely contradictory rash analysis,\u201d he said. Schumer was referring to the controversy surrounding the confirmation of former President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals chief Judge Merrick Garland to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. After the nomination, McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or a vote on Garland\u2019s nomination, at the time\u00a0citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON VOW TO NOMINATE WOMAN TO SUPREME COURT, SAYS VETTING PROCESS UNDERWAY But McConnell has said that there is no comparison in 2016 versus today, saying that in 2020, Republicans control both the White House and the Senate, unlike Democrats in 2016, who controlled only the White House. According to McConnell\u2019s office, 15 times in U.S. history, a Supreme Court vacancy has arisen in a presidential election year, and the president has moved to nominate someone to the seat. In seven\u00a0of those 15 times, according to his office, voters put in place an opposite-party Senate. McConnell\u2019s office said that only two\u00a0of those seven\u00a0nominations were confirmed, the last being in 1888. McConnell\u2019s office also pointed to eight\u00a0of those 15 times, voters had chosen a Senate majority of the same party as the president, to which seven\u00a0of those eight\u00a0nominations were confirmed. \u201cThe only such nominee who was not confirmed faced bipartisan opposition over serious questions of judicial ethics and personal finances,\u201d McConnell Communications Director David Popp said. \u201cApart from that strange exception, no Senate has failed to confirm a nominee in the circumstances that face us now.\u201d \u201cThe weight of historical precedent was behind the Senate majority\u2019s decision in 2016 and there is even more overwhelming precedent behind its decision to move forward in 2020,\u201d Popp added. WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TOP FEMALE JUDGES BEING MENTIONED FOR SCOTUS Meanwhile, President Trump said Tuesday that he'll announce his choice for the Supreme Court this Saturday at the White House\u2014 a nominee which McConnell, just hours after the death of Ginsburg on Friday, vowed \u201cwill receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d At this point, the nomination math has been tipped in favor of Trump and Republicans who want to replace Ginsburg with a conservative justice. Only two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska\u00a0\u2014 have said they oppose moving ahead with a nomination ahead of the election. On Tuesday, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined potential swing vote Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.;\u00a0Joni Ernst, R-Iowa;\u00a0Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa;\u00a0and others in backing the Senate in advancing the eventual Trump nominee. Republicans can lose up to three votes and still be able to confirm a Trump nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence as the tiebreaker. On Monday, McConnell\u00a0warned that Democrats will try \"every conceivable dirty trick\" to prevent a Trump nominee from being confirmed. Fox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'Fox News @ Night' with insight. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death Friday has put a spotlight on a handful of unpredictable Republican senators. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0announced, soon after Ginsburg's death, that the Senate would vote on a nominee put forward by President Trump to replace her.\u00a0The maverick Republicans have sometimes opposed the president, calling into question whether they would support filling a court vacancy in the coming weeks. One consideration for some of the senators: They are\u00a0fighting for their political lives this November in their own elections. The majority leader's\u00a0decision to advocate for a vote just weeks before the 2020 presidential election is a stark reversal from his position in 2016 when Justice Antonin Scalia died in February that year. McConnell said then that November voters should have a say and that a new Supreme Court justice should be nominated by the new president. McConnell didn\u2019t allow a Senate confirmation hearing or vote on former President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland -- so President Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was confirmed soon after Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017. AFTER RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S DEATH, WHAT'S COMES NEXT FOR THE SUPREME COURT Four years later, McConnell hopes to avoid any Republican defections as Democrats plan to try to peel off enough GOP senators to defeat a vote before Inauguration Day. (A tie would place the fate of a nominee in the hands of Vice President Mike Pence, in his role as Senate president.) Here's a look at the Senate Republicans who could possibly oppose allowing President Trump to fill the court vacancy prior to the election or prior to Inauguration Day. Sen.\u00a0Lisa Murkowski, the maverick Republican from Alaska, said Friday before news broke of Ginsburg\u2019s death that she would not vote for a new Supreme Court justice before the election.\u00a0\u201cWe are 50 some days away from an election,\u201d she said in an interview, according to Alaska Public Media. President Trump's ability to successfully replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the bench could hinge on the support of Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine (left), Mitt Romney of Utah, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. (Associated Press) In 2016, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said he believed Scalia\u2019s February death was too close to the November election to not have voters weigh in, according to the Denver Post. \u201cThe president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision,\u201d he said at the time. Gardner\u2019s Democratic opponent, John Hickenlooper, who has consistently led in the polls, said Friday that Gardner must \u201cuphold the commitment\u201d from 2016 to delay a vote. Gardner didn\u2019t answer the Post\u2019s requests for comment Friday, the newspaper\u00a0reported. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in a July call with donors, said he wouldn\u2019t advocate holding hearings for a Trump nominee. In 2016, Grassley, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, blocked hearings for Merrick Garland, citing the \u201cBiden rule,\u201d a 1992 speech in which then-Sen. Joe Biden said then-President George H.W. Bush should wait until after the election to appoint a Supreme Court pick. Grassley isn\u2019t up for reelection. Fellow GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is up for reelection, conversely said in July the Senate should hold hearings, according to the Des Moines Register. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, says he wouldn\u2019t advocate holding hearings for a Trump nominee. (Associated Press) MURKOWSKI, PRIOR TO GINSBURG PASSING, SAID SHE 'WOULD NOT VOTE' TO CONFIRM A NOMINEE TO SUPREME COURT BEFORE ELECTION Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, another vulnerable lawmaker in a state that isn\u2019t deeply red, declined to comment Friday on whether she\u2019d support a pre-election vote, the Portland Press Herald reported. Collins has been consistently running behind her Democratic challenger Sara Gideon, Maine\u2019s speaker of the House, in what\u2019s shaping up to be her most difficult reelection effort yet. SUSAN COLLINS HAILS GINSBURG -- BUT IS SILENT ON TRUMP NOMINEE VOTE Finally, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, hasn\u2019t weighed in yet, but he has already proven he isn\u2019t afraid to defy his party: Romney was the only Republican senator to vote to impeach Trump in February, much to the ire of Trump supporters. A pre-election Supreme Court vote could put vulnerable senators like Collins and Gardner \u2013 who need Democratic votes to win \u2013 in a difficult position and any newly elected senators will be sworn in Jan. 3. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Interestingly, astronaut Mark Kelly, a Democrat who is challenging Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., could be sworn in as early as Nov. 30 if he beats her in the race, experts say, according to the Arizona Republic. The Arizona race is technically a special election since McSally was appointed to her seat last year after Sen. John McCain\u2019s death. Kelly has consistently led McSally in the polls. McSally tweeted Friday night that \"This U.S. Senate should vote on President Trump's next nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",

            "article_content": "Tony Katz, Indianapolis-based radio talk show host, on Joe Biden SCOTUS flip-flop and AOC's warning to her progressive followers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe Biden has weighed in on Supreme Court vacancies throughout his 47-year career in politics, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice president, and now Democratic presidential nominee --\u00a0but his stance on whether the Senate should take up nominees during election years has evolved. Now,\u00a0Biden\u2019s past comments on Supreme Court nominations and confirmations have come back into this spotlight this month after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. SCHUMER SAYS MCCONNELL 'DEFILED' THE SENATE AND 'MAY VERY WELL DESTROY IT' OVER SUPREME COURT VACANCIES President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- despite pushing to delay consideration of a Supreme Court justice four years ago when Barack Obama was president and Republicans held the Senate --\u00a0have vowed to push forward with a vote on a nominee to fill Ginsburg\u2019s vacancy, and plan to do so before voters cast their ballots for president on Nov. 3. But Biden is condemning Republicans for their push to confirm a Ginsburg successor with less than seven weeks to go until the election, warning it \u201cwould cause irreversible damage.\u201d \u201cThe last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss \u2013 deeper into the darkness,\u201d Biden said, calling Trump\u2019s and McConnell\u2019s efforts an \u201cexercise in raw political power.\u201d Biden pointed to the controversy surrounding\u00a0Obama\u2019s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by late Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, and argued that \u201chaving made this their standard when it served their interest, they cannot, just four years later, change course when it doesn\u2019t serve their ends.\u201d Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing or a vote on Garland\u2019s nomination,\u00a0citing the imminent 2016 presidential election. Biden this week said that if he wins the election in November, \u201cas the new president, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg\u2019s successor.\u201d But Biden\u2019s stance on election year nominations and confirmations has shifted over the years, dating back to his time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In June 1992, Biden delivered a speech calling for then-President George H.W. Bush not to move forward with a Supreme Court nomination should a vacancy occur before the election. At the time, there was not an actual vacancy on the high court, just rumors that former Justice Harry Blackmun would retire. WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TOP FEMALE JUDGES BEING MENTIONED FOR SCOTUS During the time of his comments, Democrats held the majority of the Senate, while Republicans held the White House. Lawmakers have long cited Biden\u2019s remarks at the time as the \u201cBiden Rule,\u201d which assumes that the Senate, if controlled by a different party than the White House\u00a0during the final year of a president\u2019s term, should not consider a president\u2019s nominee to the high court ahead of Election Day. But Biden\u2019s stance shifted in 2016, during the controversy surrounding Obama\u2019s nomination of Garland to replace Scalia on the bench. Biden, at the time, delivered a speech at Georgetown University, and said \u201cthere is no \u2018Biden Rule,\u2019\u00a0it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d \u201cThere is only one rule I ever followed in the Judiciary Committee,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat was the Constitution\u2019s clear rule of advice and consent.\u201d Biden argued that the Senate had \u201can obligation\u201d to \u201cengage fully in the constitutional process of advice and consent\u201d during an election year. Biden, at the time, penned an op-ed for the New York Times, defending his past remarks, and saying that his comments in 1992 were misinterpreted. \u201cI know there is an argument that no nominee should be voted on in the last year of a presidency, but there is nothing in the Constitution\u2014or our history\u2014to support this view,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cJustice Anthony M. Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term. I know. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time.\u201d He added: \u201cAs I write this, nearly all Republican senators have said that they will refuse to consider any nominee \u2014 sight unseen. At a time when we need to reduce the gridlock in our politics, this would extend Congress\u2019s dysfunction to the Supreme Court \u2014 preventing it from functioning as our founders intended for a year and possibly longer.\u201d Biden went on to urge Republican leaders to \u201cthink about what they are doing,\u201d and \u201ctheir role in upholding the integrity of the United States Senate.\u201d \u201cIf they love the Senate as much as I do, they need to act,\u201d Biden wrote. But Ginsburg\u2019s unexpected passing has once again brought the Supreme Court into the forefront during an election year, and\u00a0Biden has shifted his stance again, urging Senate Republicans not to vote for a Trump nominee. Biden is now pleading with \"those few Senate Republicans \u2014 the handful who will really decide what happens. Don\u2019t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d Biden said this week. \u201cUphold your Constitutional duty \u2014 your conscience. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country.\u201d BIDEN CONDEMNS PUSH TO FAST TRACK TRUMP SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, CALLS IT 'EXERCISE IN RAW POLITICAL POWER' Biden stated that \"if Donald Trump wins the election \u2014 then the Senate should move on his selection \u2014 and weigh that nominee fairly.\u201d But he stressed that \"if I win the election, President Trump\u2019s nomination should be withdrawn. As the new President, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg\u2019s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation vote.\u201d Biden\u2019s shift has sparked criticism from Republicans, specifically the president\u2019s re-election campaign, casting him as a hypocrite. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s opposition to nominating and confirming a justice now is completely hypocritical and based solely on the politics of the moment,\u201d Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News Wednesday. \u201cEvery single time he\u2019s weighed in over the years, his opinion has been guided by what\u2019s good for him and his party,\u201d Murtaugh continued. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted to follow history or precedent.\u201d Meanwhile, the president is expected to announce his nominee to fill Ginsburg\u2019s vacancy on Saturday from the White House, and McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky,\u00a0has vowed that that nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the Senate. McConnell has defended his actions surrounding the Garland nomination, saying that there is no comparison between 2016 and today\u00a0because\u00a0in 2020\u00a0Republicans control both the White House and the Senate, unlike\u00a02016, when\u00a0Democrats only controlled the White House. According to McConnell\u2019s office, 15 times in U.S. history, a Supreme Court vacancy has arisen in a presidential election year, and the president has moved to nominate someone to the seat. In seven\u00a0of those 15 times, according to his office, voters put in place an opposite-party Senate. PELOSI DOESN'T RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT TO STOP TRUMP SCOTUS NOMINATION McConnell\u2019s office said that only two\u00a0of those seven\u00a0nominations were confirmed, the last being in 1888. McConnell\u2019s office also noted that in\u00a0eight\u00a0of those 15 times, voters had chosen a Senate majority of the same party as the president, to which seven\u00a0of those eight\u00a0nominations were confirmed. \u201cThe only such nominee who was not confirmed faced bipartisan opposition over serious questions of judicial ethics and personal finances,\u201d said McConnell Communications Director David Popp. \u201cApart from that strange exception, no Senate has failed to confirm a nominee in the circumstances that face us now. \u201cThe weight of historical precedent was behind the Senate majority\u2019s decision in 2016 and there is even more overwhelming precedent behind its decision to move forward in 2020,\u201d Popp added. At this point, it appears the White House and Senate Republicans have the votes to push through a nominee, as only two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska\u00a0\u2014 have said they oppose moving ahead with a nomination ahead of the election. Republicans can lose up to three votes and still be able to confirm a Trump nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence as the tiebreaker.",

            "article_content": "The presidential election is less than eight weeks away and all eyes are on battleground states like Pennsylvania. Board of Elections officials there are anticipating at least 50 percent of voters will vote by mail. Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman and Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati on Monday filed an emergency request for a stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it\u00a0to put the brakes on a Pennsylvania\u00a0Supreme Court ruling that pushed back the deadline for the state to receive mail-in ballots to\u00a0three days after\u00a0the presidential election. The filing from Corman and Scarnati, both Republicans, comes amid a fight over election law in a state that figures to be pivotal in deciding the outcome of the presidential election. The request for a stay went to Justice Samuel Alito based on geography alone\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Alito oversees the Third Circuit, in which Pennsylvania resides. \"In the middle of an ongoing election, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has altered the rules of the election and extended the 2020 general election beyond the 'time'\u00a0established by the state legislature pursuant to Article I, Section IV of the U.S. Constitution,\" the lawsuit says in its opening line.\u00a0\"In doing so, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has violated federal law and the federal Constitution.\" Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers ... by Fox News PENNSYLVANIA LAWMAKERS STRIP DOWN TO ADDRESS MAIL-IN VOTING Pennsylvania late last year established a law allowing for no-excuse absentee balloting in the state and setting a deadline of 8 p.m. on Election Day for ballots to be received in order to be counted. But\u00a0the state law allowed voters to request absentee ballots up until seven days before the election, leading the U.S. Postal Service earlier this year to warn the state that its law, consistent with USPS delivery standards, did not allow voters enough time to reliably get their ballots counted even if they followed all the rules. This led the Pennsylvania Democratic Party to file a suit asking for the deadline for the state to receive ballots be extended by seven days. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, asked the court to instead extend the deadline three days. The court followed Boockvar's recommendation in a ruling issued earlier\u00a0this month to the loud\u00a0objections of Republicans. \"In light of these unprecedented numbers and the near-certain delays that will occur in boards processing the mail-in applications, we conclude that the timeline built into the election code cannot be met by the USPS\u2019s current delivery standards,\" the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said as it cited authority to make such rulings in emergency circumstances. \"The Legislature enacted an extremely condensed timeline, providing only seven days between the last date to request a mail-in ballot and the last day to return a completed ballot. While it may be feasible under normal conditions, it will unquestionably fail under the strain of COVID-19 and the 2020 presidential election, resulting in the disenfranchisement of voters.\" BIDEN'S WHISTLE-STOP: DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE TAKING POST-DEBATE TRAIN SWING The Republican legislators' request for a stay filed on Tuesday says that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not have the authority to make such a ruling and that it could cause chaos and fraud as the crucial state tries to tabulate its votes. They also say the ruling violates federal law and the Constitution, which gives legislatures the authority to set election law and says there can only be one Election Day. \"This is an open invitation to voters to cast their ballots after Election Day, thereby injecting chaos and the potential for gamesmanship into what was an orderly and secure schedule of clear, bright-line deadlines,\" the request reads. It\u00a0adds: \"The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s decision necessarily creates multiple federal election days, including after Election Day, and raises the same concerns of fraud, undue advantage\u00a0and non-uniformity which led to the creation of a Federal Election Day.\" PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICANS PUSH BACK AFTER REPORT ALLEGES PLAN TO CIRCUMVENT POPULAR VOTE AND APPOINT TRUMP ELECTORS Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, lauded the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision at the time it was handed down. \"Yesterday\u2019s PA Supreme Court decision will help ensure voters will more easily be able to cast their ballot and have it counted fairly,\" he said. Jenn Kocher, the press secretary for Corman, told Fox News that the emphasis of their lawsuit was to ensure votes are counted quickly and accurately. \"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to determine the times, places and manner of elections lies solely within the legislative process. We are asking for the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene because we believe the Pennsylvania\u00a0Supreme Court has erred in its ruling and is jeopardizing the accountability of our election process in Pennsylvania,\" she said. \"Our goal is to fulfill our constitutional obligation to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to vote, that voters' confidence that the system is fair and that the votes are counted in a timely manner.\" \"The Pennsylvania Republican Party has every intention of attempting to protect the right of Pennsylvanians to have a free and fair election,\" Pennsylvania GOP General Counsel Tom King told Fox News. He warned that confidence in the election results would be diminished if ballots are being cast and counted after Election Day. The Pennsylvania Republican party filed a separate but similar request for a stay on Monday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Pennsylvania Democratic Party declined to comment on legal matters. Alito can either decide to grant the Pennsylvania Republicans' request for a stay on his own or refer it to the full Supreme Court. It is likely he will ask the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and other relevant parties like Boockvar to file a response before granting a stay. The Republicans\u00a0warn that without a quick grant\u00a0of their request for a stay, \"the machinery of the election will continue inexorably toward\u00a0Election Day. With each passing day, more and more voters will learn that the deadline is not Election Day \u2013 as established by statute \u2013 but three days after Election Day.\" Fox News' Bill Mears and Shannon Bream contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Who benefits from a fight over Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s successor? The passing of the iconic Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has added to the drama of 2020.\u00a0Predictably, the Democrats said her replacement should not be made until after the election while President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch\u00a0McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0say\u00a0it should be done without delay. Only one thing is\u00a0certain: there are no rules preventing the appointment and the Democrats know that. Keep in mind that, as our state, local and federal governments have grown, the power and importance of the Supreme Court have grown right along with them.\u00a0Indeed, after the first midterm elections of the Obama presidency produced divided government, the argument could be made that the U.S. Supreme Court was the most consequential branch of government. JIM DALY: PASSING OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG PUTS THIS ALL-IMPORTANT ISSUE AT CENTER OF 2020 CAMPAIGN For instance, by deciding the fate of ObamaCare, the Supreme Court determined the flow of hundreds of billions of health care dollars in one. Overall, the court made nearly 100 decisions that impacted Obama administration policy. That is the far cry from the courts our Founders envisioned. Beyond that, it has been the Democrats' strategy for years to use the courts to get the \u201csocial justice\u201d they seek and, generally, cannot get through the Congress or statehouses. Perhaps the most prominent example is gay marriage. It was rejected\u00a0by the voters of California but made its way all the way to the Supreme Court and then became the law of the land. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In no uncertain terms, the Democrats want to be the party that fills Supreme Court vacancies.\u00a0That is why I said for years that\u00a0the Democrats cared more about Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s fate than the unemployment rate. Prior to RBG\u2019s death, the Supreme Court was fairly balanced between four conservatives (Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) and four liberals (Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and RBG), with Chief Justice John\u00a0Roberts as the swing vote.\u00a0There is little question that adding a conservative would move the court decidedly to the right. The Democrats know that and they will fight tooth and nail to stop the appointment.\u00a0Let\u2019s not forget the treatment they gave Justice Kavanaugh. Again, this is the battle for the Left. The Democrats also know the only law on the issue is that the president gets to make the appointment and confirmation is up to the Senate.\u00a0There are no other rules set in stone. The most dramatic fight over our judiciary actually happened\u00a0after\u00a0John Adams lost his reelection bid to Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0Adams and his allies in Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which created new judgeships. Adams then appointed what became known as \u201cmidnight judges\u201d with his supporters in a bid to control the judiciary. Imagine if that happened today. More recently, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid\u00a0greeted\u00a0new President George W. Bush\u00a0with a filibuster against over two dozen judicial appointments. Reid did so\u00a0not because the judges en masse were unqualified, but because\u00a0he could\u00a0and he wanted to exact a political price from Bush. The Constitution gave Reid that power and there was\u00a0no legal argument to deny that. Never in our history has the fate of the court been the central issue of an election. Fast forward to this election and\u00a0Democrats are already talking about getting rid of the\u00a0filibuster altogether if they win control of the Senate. That would mean all legislation could pass by\u00a0majority vote, instead of requiring at least 60 senators to agree to hold the vote. When the Democrats controlled the Senate in 2013, they voted\u00a0to end the filibuster for presidential appointees, which included lower-court judges.\u00a0They had to power to change the rules and they did it. Plain and simple. The Democrats' history with the filibuster makes it very clear that if the shoe was on the other foot right now, they would push through a new Supreme Court nominee.\u00a0They also would block any Trump appointee during an election year just as Republicans did in 2016 when they controlled the Senate and Obama was in the White House. Never in our history has the fate of the court been the central issue of an election. It may not be the issue of this election but it certainly has made it to the top for now. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Because the Supreme Court\u00a0wields so much power, no appointment will be without controversy. No matter who Republicans pick, the Democrats will not like it and visa-versa.\u00a0That is the nature of our Divided Era. And you thought 2020 couldn\u2019t get more divisive.

            "article_content": "Fox Business correspondent Hillary Vaughn hast the latest from Waukesha, Wis. on 'Special Report' Democrats in Wisconsin, a key battleground state, are rapidly switching up their messaging on mail-in ballots after a Supreme Court ruling that disqualifies ballots received after Election Day. The party is urging voters who have yet to return their ballots to use secure drop box locations or to return them at the county clerk\u2019s office rather than relying on the mail, as first reported by The New York Times on Tuesday. About 1.4 million ballots have been returned out of more than 1.7 million that were sent,\u00a0\u00a0according to the latest state data. That\u00a0means\u00a0there are more than 360,000 voters who the state is trying to contact about the ruling and updated deadline. SUPREME COURT RULES THAT BALLOTS IN WISCONSIN MUST BE RECEIVED BY ELECTION DAY A spokesperson for the Wisconsin Democratic Party did not return Fox News\u2019 request for comment. However, on Twitter the chair of the state\u2019s Democratic Party said the group is spreading the word across as many mediums as possible, urging people to mail ballots as soon as possible or to\u00a0make plans to ensure their votes are counted. Unlike other states, Wisconsin does not report the party affiliation of voters who requested mail-in ballots. However, organizers are likely relying on data from other states, which show more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail. The Supreme Court ruled on Monday against an extension of time for counting mail-in ballots. Democrats in the state had been pushing for allowing ballots that were received within six days of Election Day to be counted, so long as they were postmarked by Election Day. Republicans had argued against the need for an extension. Wisconsin is one of several key battleground states in the 2020 election. In 2016, Trump won by a margin of less than 1 percent.

            "article_content": "John Shu, legal commentator, joins 'Fox and Friends First' to discuss the unfolding developments. The fight over the seat of late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has thrown the Supreme Court\u00a0and its current tenuous conservative majority into focus once again, as Republicans have the chance to solidify the court's rightward lean by replacing Ginsburg with a nominee from President Trump -- a prospect that has roiled Democrats and led them to re-up their threats to \"expand the Supreme Court\" if they take back the Senate majority. \"Mitch McConnell set the precedent,\" Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., tweeted last week, referring to the Republicans' 2016 move to block then-President Obama's Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election.\u00a0'No Supreme Court vacancies filled in an election year. If he violates it, when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.\" DEMS THREATEN TO PACK SUPREME COURT IF TRUMP GETS NOMINEE CONFIRMED What is court packing? Such a move, known as court packing, would be aimed at tipping the balance of the Supreme Court back in favor of liberals if Democrats manage to take the Senate and the presidency. It has not been tried since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt threatened to expand the bench to 15 justices\u00a0due to his frustration with\u00a0the Supreme Court regularly thwarting his New Deal programs on constitutional grounds. MCCONNELL WARNS OF DIRTY TRICKS FROM DEMS AS SCHUMER SAYS GOP HAS 'NO RIGHT' TO FILL SUPREME COURT VACANCY After the court stopped nearly uniformly ruling against Roosevelt's programs in the late 1930s, the president\u00a0eased up on his threats, leaving the nine-justice bench intact. The change in the Supreme Court's approach to Roosevelt's New Deal programs has been called \"The switch in time that saved nine.\" How would it work? The Supreme Court and federal judiciary are written into the Constitution, but the legislative branch, through laws it passes that are signed by the president, is given broad authority on how to set up the judicial branch, including the number of seats on the Supreme Court. \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,\" Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution reads. The Judiciary Act of 1789 established the first Supreme Court with six total justices. The number of justices changed several times in the early years of the republic, including in 1801, as the Federalist majority in Congress and Federalist President John Adams removed a seat on the Supreme Court so incoming Democratic-Republican President Thomas Jefferson couldn't fill a vacancy. U.S. Supreme Court justices pose for their group portrait at the Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., November 30, 2018. There have been nine justices on the court since 1869. Seated (L-R): Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Jr. Standing behind (L-R): Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice Elena Kagan and Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. (REUTERS/Jim Young) REPUBLICAN SENATORS FALL IN LINE TO BACK MOVING AHEAD WITH TRUMP SCOTUS PICK: 'WE'VE GOT THE VOTES' Adams also rushed to fill federal courts with Federalist judges in his last days in office, appointing what were termed \"midnight judges.\" One such appointment of a Washington, D.C., justice of the peace eventually led to the landmark\u00a0Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison, which is known for establishing federal judicial review but fundamentally ruled that new Secretary of State James Madison was required\u00a0to deliver the Adams-appointed justice of the peace his commission (though the court refused to order that Madison do so because the lawsuit was brought under an unconstitutional statute). The number of Supreme Court justices has remained constant at nine since the Judiciary Act of 1869. If congressional Democrats wanted to change that, all they would have to do is pass another Judiciary Act. What's the chance it would pass Congress? Despite the outrage felt by Markey, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and others about the Senate Republicans' plan to plow ahead with confirming a Trump Supreme Court nominee, a Democratic majority would likely have trouble getting all of its members to go along with a court packing scheme. Some Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have resisted calls from their own party to get rid of the legislative filibuster if Democrats take the majority -- the filibuster\u00a0is simply a Senate rule and nothing that's required by law or the Constitution. Moderate Democrats\u00a0would likely be even more reluctant to upend a law with over 150 years of precedent to change the number of justices on the Supreme Court. Additionally, a new Judiciary Act would\u00a0be a piece of legislation that a potential President Biden would need to sign. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's unclear that the candidate who currently portrays himself as a unifier\u00a0would go along with such a drastic plan. Nor is it clear that court expansion\u00a0would be able to pass the House, which is more likely than not to remain in Democratic hands but also has its fair share of Democratic members in swing seats who might have trepidations about fundamentally altering the longstanding structure of a co-equal branch of government. Nevertheless, Schumer has emphasized that should Democrats seize the Senate and the White House, \"nothing's off the table\" for what Democrats could do in retaliation for the Senate moving ahead with a Trump Supreme Court nominee. He said forcefully Monday that Republicans should not be the ones to replace Ginsburg. \"The stakes of this election, the stakes of this vacancy, concern no less than\u00a0the future of fundamental rights for the American people...\u00a0If you care about these things and the\u00a0kind of country we live in, this election and this vacancy mean everything,\" Schumer said. \"By every modicum of decency and honor,\u00a0Leader McConnell and the Republican majority have no right to fill it.\"",

            "article_content": "VP tells Democrat challenger: 'You're entitled to your own opinion, not your own facts' Vice President Mike Pence hammered Sen. Kamala Harris Wednesday night over whether Democrats would pack the Supreme Court should they not \u201cget their way,\u201d and should Judge Amy Coney Barrett be confirmed to the high court before Election Day. During the vice presidential debate, Pence said that the \u201cAmerican people really deserve an answer\u201d on court packing, after Democratic nominee Joe Biden ducked the question during the first presidential debate last week. AMY CONEY BARRETT'S 65-PAGE RESPONSE TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE QUESTIONNAIRE RELEASED \u201cAre you and Joe Biden going to pack the court if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? Are you going to pack the court?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cYour party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had 9 seats for 150 years, if you don\u2019t get your way.\u201d Pence added that the threat from Democrats is a \u201cclassic case of \u2018if you can\u2019t win by the rules, you change the rules.\u201d Harris did not respond. Pence revisited the question, saying that the \u201cAmerican people would really like to know, if she is confirmed, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\u201d Democrats have threatened to pack the Supreme Court if President Trump\u2019s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who was tapped to fill the vacancy left by late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is confirmed ahead of the 2020 presidential election. DUCKWORTH WARNS AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION COULD PUT IVF PROCEDURES AT 'HIGH RISK' The idea of \u201cpacking\u201d the court with extra justices \u2013\u00a0attempted unsuccessfully\u00a0by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1937 to force through parts of his New Deal that were\u00a0ruled unconstitutional by the high court \u2013\u00a0has bubbled away on the fringes of the party for years. Harris fired back, mum on the issue of court packing, but saying that the \u201cAmerican people deserve to make the decision\u201d of \u201cwho will serve for a lifetime.\u201d \u201cJoe and I are very clear the American people are voting right now, and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime,\" she said. Democrats\u00a0have\u00a0objected to a confirmation so close to the election, citing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s refusal to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. McConnell, though, has said that it is a different situation as the White House and the Senate are not held by opposing parties. Republicans, though, appear to have the votes to move forward and confirm Barrett. Republicans have 53 votes in the Senate\u00a0and can therefore afford three defections if no Democrat votes for the nominee. In that instance, Vice President Mike Pence would be called in to break a tie. BARRETT ROSE GARDEN ANNOUNCEMENT: HERE'S WHO TESTED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FOR COVID-19 Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearing is set to begin on Oct. 12 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Harris sits on, and run through Oct. 15. But Pence pushed Harris again on this issue, asking, once again, \u201cif you and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court?\u201d Harris finally responded, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about packing the court then.\u201d \u201cI have witnessed appointments for lifetime appointments to federal courts,\u201d Harris said, referring to her time on the Judiciary Committee during the Trump administration. \u201cPeople who are purely ideological, who have been reviewed and found to have been not competent, or substandard.\u201d She went on to say that \u201cof the 50 people Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals\u2014lifetime appointments\u2014no one is Black.\u201d \u201cWant to talk about packing a court?\u201d Harris said. \u201cLet\u2019s have that discussion.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The ruby red state 'is not ready for them to take,' Republican Party of Texas Chairman Allen West tells 'Fox &amp; Friends'&nbsp; A federal judge in Houston is holding an emergency hearing Monday morning over a Republican-led effort to toss out nearly 127,000 ballots in the largest\u00a0Texas\u00a0county. U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen, who was appointed by President George W. Bush,\u00a0will hear arguments from four Texas Republicans seeking to invalidate all ballots cast at drive-thru polling stations in Harris County, a Democratic stronghold. The Republican activists and candidates are arguing that the drive-thru program is an expansion of curbside voting, and therefore should only be available to voters with disabilities under state election law. They have also challenged the practice as a violation of the U.S. Constitution, which gives state legislatures the authority to decide how elections are run. TEXAS GOV SUED OVER PLAN TO REDUCE BALLOT DROP BOX LOCATIONS On top of throwing out ballots already cast via drive-thru voting, the Republicans are looking to ban the use of the practice on Tuesday during Election Day. The Texas Supreme Court rejected\u00a0a case from the same plaintiffs over the same issue on Sunday. The all-Republican court did not explain why it had thrown out the lawsuit. State election law has long allowed Texans with medical conditions to vote curbside, in which a ballot is brought outside to them by a poll worker while the voter\u00a0remains in their car. Harris County also opened 10 drive-thru locations in October for early voting, in which voters are handed a portable machine through their car window to vote, as a safety measure during the coronavirus pandemic. Drive-thru voting allows for voters to safely cast their ballots while \"naturally socially distanced\" within their vehicles and is as secure as walk-in voting, according to the\u00a0Harris County Clerk's Office website. As of Friday, nearly 127,000 of Harris County's 2.4 million eligible voters had cast a ballot through drive-thru voting, representing about 9% of the total votes cast so far. TEXAS COUNTY SUED OVER LACK OF POLLING SITES In\u00a0a brief\u00a0filed late Sunday night, attorneys for Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins called on Hanen to reject the lawsuit. \"The Texas Supreme Court has twice declined to interfere,\" the brief says. \"The\u00a0fact that the final arbiter of the Texas Election Code found no justification for interfering with drive-through polling places\u2014based on the same legal arguments\u2014in the middle of the election is an unmistakable indication that the public interest is best served by allowing the election to proceed without interference.\" Texas has some of the most stringent voting laws in the country and is one of a\u00a0handful of states that did not relax criteria for requesting mail-in ballots during the virus-induced crisis. The state allows\u00a0voters to cast an absentee ballot if they are over the age of 65,\u00a0have an illness or disability,\u00a0will be out of the country for early voting or Election Day,\u00a0or are in jail but otherwise eligible to vote. According to an aggregate of\u00a0polls\u00a0from RealClearPolitics, President Trump is leading Democratic rival Joe Biden\u00a0by 4.4\u00a0percentage points in Texas.

            "article_content": "Senate vote to confirm Barrett expected Monday; reaction and insight from WSJ\u2019s Jess Bravin. When the Senate votes on Monday evening to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court, it will be just over a week before Election Day that will decide what both parties are portraying as the most important race in American history. If Barrett is confirmed to become a member of the highest bench in the country \u2013 and, with Republicans easily having enough votes to confirm her, that seems to be a foregone conclusion \u2013 one of the first cases she could hear as a new Supreme Court justice could decide who wins the White House. Courts at all levels have been deluged with cases relating to balloting in the run up to Election Day \u2013 and amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic \u2013 but one in particular has garnered nation attention. Republicans in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania want the Supreme Court to rule on whether ballots received after Election Day can be counted. With the state still very much up for grabs and its 20 Electoral College votes possibly being the key to who the country\u2019s next president is, both Republicans and Democrats are heavily invested in what happens to those late-arriving ballots. LIVE UPDATES: AMY CONEY BARRETT'S NOMINATION ADVANCES TOWARD SENATE VOTE The Supreme Court justices split 4-4 last Monday over a Republican plea to undo a state court order and force elections officials to ignore absentee ballots received after Election Day, Nov. 3. The tie vote left the Pennsylvania court order in effect and allows mailed ballots to be counted if they are received by Nov. 6. Chief Justice John Roberts and his three liberal colleagues voted to leave the court order in place. With the possibility of Barrett, a conservative jurist, joining the bench and giving the Court a 6-3 conservative majority, Republicans are hopeful that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of ignoring the ballots received after Election Day. Democrats, on the other hand, are decrying Barrett\u2019s confirmation as a political act by President Trump to help him maintain the White House in a race that shows him consistently losing in the polls and as \u201cvoter suppression\u201d tactic. \u201cOne more vote, provided by a hard-right, Trump-nominated justice, could be the difference between voting rights and voting suppression,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on Tuesday. Trump already has signaled one reason for Barrett\u2019s speedy nomination, just eight days after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, was to have her confirmed and installed on the court in time for any election lawsuit that might reach the justices. \u201cI think it's better if you go before the election because I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling, it\u2019s a scam, this scam will be before the United States Supreme Court,\" Trump said shortly after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month. \"And I think having a 4-4 situation is not a good situation. If you get that. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019d get that. I think it should be eight-to-nothing or nine-to-nothing, but just in case it would be more political than it should be.\" The court\u2019s conservatives, Roberts included, have regularly sided with state officials who object when a federal court relaxes election rules, even if the changes arise from the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the Supreme Court generally won\u2019t disturb state court rulings that are rooted in state law. LISA MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR AMY CONEY BARRETT DURING RARE SATURDAY SENATE SESSION But civil rights lawyers and election law experts said the vote in the Pennsylvania case indicates at least four conservatives may be willing to look at state court election-related decisions in a way that calls to mind Bush v. Gore. \u201cBased on Judge Barrett\u2019s record, there is every reason to believe that she would have been a fifth vote in favor of the Supreme Court overstepping its bounds and interfering with a non-federal issue that would have jeopardized voter access,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The group opposes Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Pennsylvania Republicans relied in part on an opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas and two other conservative justices in Bush v. Gore to argue that the Supreme Court should get involved in the case because the state court had improperly taken powers given by the U.S. Constitution to state lawmakers when it comes to presidential elections. The court ruled for Bush on other grounds, that ballots were being handled differently across the state in violation of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection. The Senate on Sunday voted 51-48 to limit debate on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, setting up a vote on her confirmation for Monday evening. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sunday's vote limited debate over President Trump's court appointee to 30 hours, meaning the full Senate will be able to hold a confirmation vote Monday beginning at approximately 7:26 p.m. ET. Two Republicans voted against ending debate, Sens.\u00a0Susan Collins, R-Maine.,\u00a0and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Murkowski has, however, indicated that she will vote to confirm Barrett. Previously, Supreme Court justices needed to clear a 60-vote threshold to advance to the high court, a tradition that forced nominees to win bipartisan support. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., changed the standard in 2017\u00a0to allow for a simple majority, a move that allowed for the confirmation of President Trump's previous two nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

            "article_content": " Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in\u00a0June Medical Services v. Russo\u00a0deals a cruel blow to\u00a0vulnerable women and girls\u00a0and is a bitter disappointment to the pro-life movement.\u00a0As\u00a0with the tragic\u00a0Hellerstedt\u00a0decision four years ago,\u00a0it underscores that life and death are at stake in the coming elections. The opinion, authored by Justice Stephen Breyer with concurrence by Chief Justice John Roberts, strikes down Louisiana\u2019s pro-life, pro-woman law that simply requires\u00a0abortionists to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. This modest protection was manifestly necessary due to the\u00a0horrendous\u00a0track record\u00a0of\u00a0abortionists and the facilities they run, both in Louisiana and across the nation\u00a0\u2013 a litany of abuse and negligence that includes botched\u00a0abortions, unsanitary conditions, and a clear pattern of putting profits before health and safety. LIZ PEEK: INVISIBLE JOE BIDEN\u00a0\u2013 CAN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE REALLY HIDE THROUGH ELECTION DAY? The Unsafe\u00a0Abortion\u00a0Protection Act was introduced by a pro-life Democrat, passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in the state legislature, and signed into law by a Democratic governor.\u00a0Previously it was\u00a0upheld\u00a0by the 5th\u00a0U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the facts on the ground were substantially different from those in the\u00a0Hellerstedt\u00a0case. Once again the Supreme Court, led by a Republican (George W. Bush) appointee\u00a0who opted to reverse himself and\u00a0prioritize precedent\u00a0over\u00a0the Constitution, has imposed its own will contrary to that of the people and their elected representatives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER To their credit, Justices ClarenceThomas and Samuel Alito, as well as President Trump\u2019s appointees Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch,\u00a0strongly\u00a0dissented \u2013 but it was not enough to overcome a narrow majority. For that, we need President Trump to fill at least one more inevitable vacancy. Pro-life\u00a0momentum cannot be ignored.\u00a0In response to growing extremism in states controlled by pro-abortion\u00a0Democrats, pro-life lawmakers\u00a0are\u00a0eager\u00a0to\u00a0implement protections for unborn children and\u00a0challenge\u00a0Roe\u00a0v. Wade.\u00a0A prominent pro-abortion\u00a0think tank\u00a0notes\u00a0with alarm that more than one-third of all pro-life state laws since\u00a0Roe\u00a0have been passed within the last 10\u00a0years \u2013 nearly 60 of them enacted\u00a0in 2019\u00a0alone.\u00a0Just this month, lawmakers in\u00a0Tennessee\u00a0and\u00a0Mississippi\u00a0took bold strides for life. Many of these are\u00a0assertive laws that protect unborn children throughout pregnancy, stop late-term\u00a0abortions after five months when unborn babies can feel excruciating pain, and protect unborn children from lethal discrimination because of Down syndrome or other\u00a0disabilities. Pro-life\u00a0legal scholars believe laws like these afford the best opportunity to aggressively challenge\u00a0Roe.\u00a0Justice Clarence Thomas previously\u00a0wrote\u00a0that\u00a0laws banning discrimination\u00a0abortions\u00a0present an \u201cissue of first impression\u201d that the court \u201ccannot avoid\u201d forever. While\u00a0pro-life advocates\u00a0have\u00a0endured betrayals by\u00a0Republican-appointed justices,\u00a0we know exactly what to expect with Joe Biden. The presumed Democratic nominee for president has promised to\u00a0nominate\u00a0pro-abortion\u00a0ideologues\u00a0to\u00a0the high court who will enforce his radical agenda. Biden and his administration will set about rolling back decades of hard-won pro-life gains and expanding\u00a0abortion\u00a0on demand through birth, paid for by taxpayers.\u00a0Today\u2019s\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0leaders are so extreme, they\u00a0show open hostility\u00a0to the millions of\u00a0rank-and-file Democrats\u00a0who\u00a0identify as pro-life\u00a0\u2013 refusing to even tolerate debate within the party. If pro-life advocates want to win\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and win decisively\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in the future, it is imperative that we reelect President Trump and secure a strong majority in the U.S. Senate. President Trump,\u00a0in contrast,\u00a0has earned the\u00a0title of\u00a0most pro-life president in history. He and his administration\u00a0have done everything in their power to protect unborn children and their mothers, including appointing 200 federal judges \u2013 an historic milestone for the pro-life movement. With the\u00a0recent\u00a0appointment of Judge Cory Wilson \u2013 a strong constitutionalist \u2013 to the\u00a0Fifth\u00a0Circuit,\u00a0all appellate-level vacancies are filled\u00a0for\u00a0the first time in\u00a0four decades. Aided by pro-life Senate allies like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the president\u00a0is keeping his promises\u00a0and shows no sign of stopping or slowing.\u00a0These lifetime appointments will bear fruit for generations and help determine which cases\u00a0move forward. If pro-life advocates want to win\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and win decisively\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in the future, it is imperative that we reelect President Trump and secure a strong majority in the U.S. Senate.\u00a0The next president will likely fill at least one or two\u00a0vacancies\u00a0on the Supreme Court, and Monday\u2019s decision makes clear we do not yet have a majority on the Supreme Court who will uphold laws that protect the lives of women and unborn children. Susan B. Anthony List is uniquely poised to\u00a0influence the election, with its passionate grassroots canvassing army, well-developed battleground state infrastructure\u00a0and\u00a0field-tested strategy. Our ground team is working to reach 4.6 million voters \u2013 as many as the last three election cycles combined \u2013 to defeat Biden and\u00a0his fellow\u00a0abortion\u00a0extremists. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Today\u2019s ruling should unify the pro-life movement and renew our resolve and intensity heading into this most crucial of elections. Pro-life voters\u00a0must\u00a0engage\u00a0and flex our political muscle\u00a0like never before to\u00a0ensure that a future court\u00a0will not make\u00a0a similar\u00a0grave mistake. The arc of the\u00a0moral\u00a0universe is long, but it bends toward justice\u00a0for the unborn and their mothers\u00a0\u2013 and we will never stop fighting to achieve it.

            "article_content": "The former U.S. Attorney discusses concerns about election integrity on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019 The Trump campaign and GOP leadership on Monday continued to raise allegations of voter fraud and misconduct at the polls last week as it marches forward with its legal challenges despite facing long odds given the Electoral College tally and recent court rulings that found no evidence of widespread vote fraud. White Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who was joined by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel at a hectic press conference in Washington D.C., argued that the presidential election is far from over, despite major networks and news agencies calling\u00a0 the race for Now President-elect Joe Biden. \u201cWe have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate and fair vote count,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cOur position is clear we want to protect the franchise of the American people.\u201d She added: \u201cWe want maximum transparency\u2026We want every legal vote to be counted.\u201d BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY, TRUMP DENIED SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE, FOX NEWS PROJECTS McEnany and McDaniel claimed that there were widespread instances of voter fraud and inconsistencies during the vote count last week. They also bemoaned allegations that Republican poll watchers were prohibited from observing the vote counting process. \u201cWe should all be alarmed by this,\u201d McDaniel said before urging members of the media to \u201cinterview these people, talk to these people.\u201d Neither the Trump campaign nor Republican officials, however, have so far released the names of either the election observers or the election officials who they say have reported incidents in key battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Monday, Trump lawyers soldiered on six days after the election, just as personal counsel Rudy Giuliani had promised they would during a surreal weekend press conference outside a landscaping storefront in northeast Philadelphia. Giuliani denounced the city\u2019s vote count \u2014 which fell about 4-1 for Biden, giving the Democrat the win Saturday in both Pennsylvania and the U.S. election \u2014 as \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d Across the country, Republicans have complained about problems with the signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on ballots, the inability of their poll watchers to scrutinize them and the extensions granted for mail-in ballots to arrive. However, judges have largely rejected the Republican challenges over the past week as the campaign sought to interrupt the vote count as it leaned toward Biden. Trump has yet to concede the election, even as the former vice president claimed victory and got to work on his transition plans. TRUMP WOULD CONCEDE, WORK ON PEACEFUL TRANSITION IF LEGAL FIGHT FALLS SHORT, SOURCES SAY, DESPITE TWEETS At the U.S. Supreme Court, 10 Republican state attorneys general filed an amicus brief Monday to support a challenge to Pennsylvania's decision to count mail-in ballots that arrived through Friday. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had unanimously upheld the three-day extension set by Democratic state officials concerned about Postal Service delays and the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump\u2019s allies have claimed that Democratic lawmakers in battleground states have used the coronavirus pandemic to manipulate the election process. \u201cThey have taken a global pandemic and turned it into a nationwide electoral epidemic,\u201d McEnany said Monday. Earlier Monday, an anti-abortion law center in Michigan filed suit to complain about vote counting procedures in Wayne County. An appeals court in Michigan, meanwhile, asked the Trump campaign to refile a case submitted last week, saying the appeal was incomplete. And in Arizona, the Trump campaign asked in a lawsuit filed Saturday for the right to inspect thousands of in-person ballots filled out on Election Day in the Phoenix area, alleging that poll workers had mishandled them. In Georgia, where Biden has a small lead over Trump but the race remains too early to call, a state election official pledged Monday to investigate any ballot problems they find. Despite these efforts, Trump aides and allies have acknowledged privately the legal fights would \u2014 at best \u2014 forestall the inevitable, and some had deep reservations about the president's attempts to undermine faith in the vote. But they said Trump and a core group of allies were aiming to keep his loyal base of supporters on his side even in defeat. Voter fraud is extremely rare, and when it does happen, people are generally caught and prosecuted and it does not change the outcome of the election. Typically, it involves someone wanting to honor the wishes of a loved one who recently died and either knowingly or not commits a crime by filling out that ballot. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Trump\u2019s own administration has pushed back at the claims of widespread voter fraud and illegal voting though it didn\u2019t mention Trump was the one making the allegations. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, also noted local election offices have detection measures that \u201cmake it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots.\u201d Top election officials in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada - both Republican and Democrat - have all said they see no widespread voting irregularities, no major instances of fraud or illegal activity. While some Republican lawmakers have accepted that Biden won the election, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not congratulated the president-elect on his projected victory and argued that Trump is \u201c100% within his rights\u201d to question election results and consider legal options. The Republican leader's remarks, his first public comments since Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election, come as Trump's allies on Capitol Hill have been reluctant to congratulate Biden or push the president to accept the outcome. McConnell said the process will play out and \u201creach its conclusion.\u201d \u201cOur institutions are actually built for this,\u201d McConnell said as he opened the Senate. \u201cWe have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is remaining silent on whether he supports a move by many progressives to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court if the Democrats win back the White House and take control of the Senate in November\u2019s elections. Asked Thursday by reporters if he supports such a move, Biden once again refused to answer, saying \u201cyou\u2019ll know my position on court-packing the day after the election.\u201d BIDEN SILENT ON COURT PACKING The former vice president once again described the question\u00a0as a distraction to what he termed the main issue \u2013 the push by President Trump and the Republican majority in the Senate to quickly move before Election Day to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative federal appeals court judge nominated by Trump to succeed liberal-leaning Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cThe moment I answer that question, the headline in every one of your papers will be about that rather than focusing on what\u2019s happening now. This election has begun. There\u2019s never been a court appointment once the election has begun,\u201d the former vice president emphasized. HOW WOULD COURT PACKING WORK Biden and Democrats have repeatedly argued that voters should have a say in the nomination, by choosing the next president and by determining which party controls the Senate.\u00a0Biden has urged that the winner of the presidential election should nominate the successor to Ginsburg.

During the Democratic presidential primaries, Biden said that he opposed a move to expand \u2013 or pack \u2013 the high court. But with Democrats virtually powerless to stop the president and Senate Republicans from pushing through Barrett\u2019s nomination ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and tilting the court\u2019s conservative majority to 6-3, many on the left are now calling for an expansion of the court to rebalance the ideological ratio of the justices.

            "article_content": "Former Trump campaign pollster Jim McLaughlin with a look at early numbers in key states. The Texas Supreme Court rejected a challenge from the state Republican Party to halt drive-thru voting Thursday, which\u00a0started earlier this year in Harris County as a socially distanced way to vote amid the coronavirus pandemic. Judge John Devine dissented from the Texas\u00a0Supreme Court's order that denied the emergency motion. Harris County currently has 10 drive-thru polling places that give citizens\u00a0a \"safer, socially-distant alternative to walk-in voting for all voters.\" OHIOANS CAST RECORD 1.1M BALLOTS, DOUBLING 2016 EARLY VOTE TALLY \"Harris County is the first jurisdiction in Texas history to create this new method of voting at scale that allows any registered voter to cast their ballot without leaving the comfort of their vehicle,\" the county\u00a0Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins explains. The Texas GOP challenged the drive-thru polling option in court right before early voting started last week. \u201cWe are perplexed by the Supreme Court of Texas\u2019s decision today,\" a spokesman for the state's Republican Party told Fox News. \"However, this whole situation would have been avoided if the unelected, partisan, Chris Hollins, had not abused his position as county clerk of Harris County to manipulate the election process and undermine electoral integrity.\u201d TEXAS LEADS US IN EARLY VOTING WITH OVER 4M BALLOTS ALREADY CAST Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, agreed with the Texas GOP, saying in a letter to election officials last Friday that according to the state's election code, poll workers, \"may provide a ballot to a registered voter 'at the polling place entrance or curb'\u00a0only if the voter is 'physically unable to enter the polling place without personal assistance or likelihood of injuring the voter's health.'\" But an appeals court ruled last week that the Texas GOP does not have standing, particularly because the election is already underway. The court noted that Hollins announced on Sept. 10 that curbside voting would be an option for early voting and Election Day,\u00a0but the state Republican Party waited until last week to file its lawsuit. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After the Texas Supreme Court also rejected the challenge Thursday,\u00a0Hollins said the county \"has provided its electorate with more voting access than ever before.\" \"Once again, the law is on our side. The Court's decision to uphold the legality of Drive-Thru Voting as a safe and convenient way to vote underscores that this November, democracy is on the ballot,\" Hollins said in a statement. \"Texas Election Code clearly allows for our ten drive-thru voting centers to serve as polling places, and my office consulted with the Texas Secretary of State as we developed our Drive-Thru Voting program.\" Harris County is\u00a0the largest county in Texas with 4.7 million people. The state is expected to shatter voting records this year as 5.7 million citizens already voted early, according to the U.S. Elections Project.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., tells 'Special Report' he won't support 'court packing' if party wins slim majority Senator Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., said that if Democrats are able to win control of the Senate, he will not back his party's calls to pack the Supreme Court, eliminate the filibuster rule nor any other \"crazy stuff\" they may intend to put forward under a Biden presidency. Manchin told \"Special Report\" on Monday that he is a proud Democrat and that it must be understood that not every elected member of the party supports the progressive wing's policy priorities -- though appeared to acknowledge they have been given some weight during the election cycle. He noted that if Republicans Sens. Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina are able to fend off Democratic challengers in two races not yet called by Fox News, the control of the chamber may come down to dueling runoff elections in Georgia. Incumbent Kelly Loeffler -- appointed to fulfill the rest of retired Sen. Johnny Isakson's, R-Ga., term --\u00a0and David Perdue, both Republicans, face Pastor Raphael Warnock and journalist Jon Ossoff respectively in January. \"50-50 [control] means that if one senator does not vote on the Democratic side, there is no tie and there is no bill,\" Manchin said. \"I\u00a0commit to tonight and I commit\u00a0to all of your viewers and everyone else that's watching, I\u00a0want to allay those fears, I want\u00a0to rest those fears for you\u00a0right now because when they talk\u00a0about, whether it be packing the\u00a0courts or ending the filibuster,\u00a0I will not vote to do that,\" he continued. Manchin called the U.S. Senate a \"unique\" legislative body in that the original parameters encourage bipartisanship. He said that he also does not know whether any or enough Democrats would support bills along the lines of \"defunding the police,\" and that he believes there would in turn be Republicans willing to compromise on \"fixing\" ObamaCare. To back up his pledge not to support ending the filibuster and such, he pointed to his opposition to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., doing so for judicial nominees several years ago. Manchin also however dismissed any contention that he would switch parties due to his moderate stance on such issues, a question that has come up in the past as well.

            "article_content": "Trump, Biden spar over Supreme Court vacancy during first presidential debate in Cleveland. President Trump said Tuesday night there\u2019s \u201cnothing happening\u201d in the Supreme Court with Roe v. Wade, and it isn\u2019t on the ballot with the latest Supreme Court vacancy. \"Roe v. Wade. That's also at stake right now,\" Joe Biden said during the presidential debate, arguing Judge Amy Coney Barrett should not be confirmed to fill the seat vacated after the death of\u00a0Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the election. He said abortion rights granted by Roe v. Wade were \u201calso on the ballot.\u201d \u201cWhy is it on the ballot? It\u2019s not on the ballot,\u201d Trump retorted. \"There's nothing happening there.\u201d \u201cYou don't know what her views are,\u201d Trump said of Barrett. LIBERAL WOMENS' GROUPS SLAM BARRETT, CLAIM SHE WILL 'TURN BACK THE CLOCK' ON EQUALITY On Sunday, Trump told Fox and Friends Weekend that if Barrett were confirmed by the Senate, it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d that the 6-3 conservative majority would rule on a \u201clife issue.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible. And maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they\u2019d give it back to the states. You just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u2018\u201cShe is certainly conservative in her views, in her rulings, and we\u2019ll have to see how that all works out, but I think it will work out,\u201d the president said of his Supreme Court nominee. Trump in 2016 promised to overturn Roe v. Wade in a presidential debate. \"That will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court,\" Trump said. \"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\" In 2017 when Barrett was confirmed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she assumed Barrett would be a \u201cno vote\u201d on Roe v. Wade. \u201cThere would be no opportunity for me to be a no vote on Roe,\u201d Barrett responded. \u201cAnd I would faithfully apply all Supreme Court precedent.\u201d \"It's never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law,\u201d she added. Barrett, while a Notre Dame law professor in 2016, was asked about ways a future Supreme Court might potentially allow states to further restrict abortion. GRAHAM DETAILS TIMELINE FOR AMY CONEY BARRETT SUPREME COURT PROCESS STARTING OCT. 12 \"I think don't think the core case \u2013\u00a0Roe's core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion \u2013 I don't think that would change. But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics \u2013 I think that would change,\" Barrett said during an appearance at Jacksonville University in Florida. Still, Democrats have sounded the alarm on Barrett\u2019s nomination and how it could play out in the abortion debate, particularly noting her devout Catholic faith. Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson said that Barrett expresses \u201chostility\u201d toward reproductive rights.

            "article_content": "Shannon Bream, Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of 'Fox News @ Night,' joins 'America's Newsroom.' The influx of campaign cash came fast and furious. In the hours after the death of trailblazing\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Democratic Senate candidates running in November\u2019s election saw a surge in fundraising. REPUBLICAN SENATORS FALL IN LINE TO BACK GOP PUSH TO IMMEDIATELY FILL SUPREME COURT SEAT Democratic challengers to GOP incumbent senators in states such as Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina\u00a0and even Alaska\u00a0saw an instant infusion into their campaign coffers. \u201cIt's clear that Democratic voters and donors who are already very highly motivated to take back the Senate are now doubly so motivated based on the influx of cash that virtually all Democratic candidates received,\u201d a Democratic strategist involved in Senate races told Fox News. In total, tens of millions of dollars \u2013 and counting \u2013 poured into the campaigns of Senate Democrats, with at least a dozen of the candidates hauling in more $1 million each. The surge inflated a fundraising advantage Senate Democratic candidates had enjoyed for months. \u201cWe were already seeing a green wave forming for Democrats in fundraising over the past year. Ginsburg\u2019s death accelerated that to a green tsunami that is still growing. That can really provide a late influx of cash for some of these campaigns that really needed it,\u201d Jessica Taylor, who closely tracks and reports on Senate races for the nonpartisan political handicapper The Cook Report, told Fox News. \u201cIt shows that the issue of the court is not one that just motivates Republicans, it\u2019s motivating Democrats as well,\u201d Taylor emphasized. The fierce fight over the push by President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to fill the progressive Ginsburg\u2019s held seat with a conservative justice with just six weeks to go until the November election, when control of the presidency and the Senate are up for grabs, has upended an already toxic battle for control of the upper chamber of Congress. The GOP\u00a0enjoys a 53-47 majority in the Senate, but Republicans are defending 23 of the 35 Senate seats up for grabs this year. And while more than a\u00a0half-dozen GOP seats are considered battlegrounds, Democrats\u00a0are defending just one or two vulnerable incumbents. Democrats need to pick up four seats to grab control of the chamber \u2013 or three if the ticket of Democratic nominee Joe Biden and vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris wins the White House. The vice president serves as the tie-breaking vote when the upper chamber is deadlocked. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 BATTLE FOR THE SENATE The infusion of campaign cash should allow some of these Democratic challengers to increase their ad buys or boost their get-out-the-vote efforts during the final stretch \u2013 and it comes as early absentee and in-person voting is already underway in some of the Senate battlegrounds. But the fundraising surge is far from a guarantee of success. Many of the seats the Democrats need to flip from red to blue are in states President Trump won four\u00a0years ago. And the battle over Ginsburg\u2019s successor could possibly unite conservatives like no other issue has galvanized them this year. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell in some of these races how much this will move numbers because a lot of states are extremely polarized. I think in states that Trump lost, it\u2019s very much going to hurt the GOP incumbents in those states,\u201d Taylor noted. Among those states is Maine, where GOP incumbent Susan Collins has represented her state in the Senate for nearly a quarter-century. The race in Maine was already focused on the Supreme Court \u2013 courtesy of Collins\u2019 controversial vote in favor of the 2018 confirmation of Trump nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Taylor highlighted that \u201cthis brings back up that issue at a time she doesn\u2019t need it even though she is one of only two GOP senators that oppose\u201d confirming a new high court justice until Americans elect a new president. An average of the latest polls in the race compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates Collins is trailing Democratic challenger and Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon by six\u00a0points. The confirmation battle also likely does no favors for Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who faces a very challenging reelection in a purple state that's trending blue against former two-term Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. \u201cHe was already facing incredibly tough headwinds and this makes the calculation so much tougher. He is now the decided underdog in that race,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe Supreme Court issue has turned what was already a national race even more so.\u201d But the spotlight on the Supreme Court could help other Republican incumbents also facing extremely challenging runs for a new term in the Senate. Sens. Martha McSally of Arizona and Thom Tillis of North Carolina are running behind the president\u2019s numbers in their purple states. Both senators announced this week that they back the president\u2019s push to immediately confirm a new justice \u2013 moves that may help them consolidate support from some Trump voters in their states. It's also potentially benefiting\u00a0to GOP Rep. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who\u2019s running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts in a state that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive but still remains very red at the federal level. The Supreme Court battle will also likely impact Iowa and Georgia \u2013 where Republican Sens. Joni Ernst and David Perdue are locked in tough reelection bids with their Democratic challengers. And then there\u2019s South Carolina, where Senate Judiciary Chairman and longtime Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is facing a challenging reelection for the first time. Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison, who made history as the state\u2019s first Black Democratic Party chair, hauled in $10 million last month. He brought in millions more in the days after Ginsburg\u2019s death. \u201cYou have a Democratic base that energized for the first time in a long time with a legitimate candidate with what seems like unlimited money,\u201d Taylor spotlighted. Now, Graham\u2019s own words from 2016 are being used against him. During the 2016 presidential election, McConnell denied any confirmation hearing for federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, who was former\u00a0President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the seat of the late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Graham \u2013 in a soundbite that\u2019s been played repeatedly the past couple of days - said at the time that \"I want you to use my words against me. If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term \u2026 you can say Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.\u201d Opponents of the senator are taking Graham up on his offer. The anti-Trump GOP super PAC The Lincoln Project is teaming up with the anti-Graham group Lindsey Must Go to spend nearly $1 million to run a new TV ad in South Carolina that spotlights Graham's own words as they target what they call the senator\u2019s \u201cSupreme Court hypocrisy.\u201d The latest poll in the race, from Quinnipiac University, shows the two candidates tied, although Graham charges the survey vastly under samples GOP voters.

            "article_content": "Fox News contributor Donna Brazile provides insight on why Democrats disagree with the GOP rushing to confirm Judge Barrett. This week, Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began on the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. Putting aside the blatant hypocrisy of Senate Republicans who are trying to jam through Judge Barrett\u2019s nomination less than 20 days before Election Day \u2013 and when approximately 10 million Americans have already cast their votes for the next president of the United States \u2013 this nomination endangers the lives of tens of millions of Americans who may lose their health care in the middle of a deadly pandemic if Judge Barrett is confirmed to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by\u00a0Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death. Why, you might ask, am I being so dramatic?\u00a0I\u2019m not! This is a matter of life and death for many Americans. EMILY'S LIST PRESIDENT SCHRIOCK: AMY CONEY BARRETT SHOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED \u2013 HERE'S WHY Simply put, President Donald Trump and his administration\u2019s umpteenth lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be heard by the Supreme Court\u00a0on November 10, exactly one week after an election that Trump and his Republican minions in the U.S. Senate may very well lose. And Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R\u2013 Ky., and Senate Republicans are holding confirmation hearings for Judge Barrett this week to guarantee that she will join her right-wing colleagues on the Supreme Court and cast a potentially tie-breaking vote in Trump\u2019s case to invalidate the ACA \u2013 ripping health care away from 20 million Americans and eliminating protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions \u2013 rather than debate and vote on legislation to provide critical coronavirus relief to the American people. Here\u2019s the bottom line: By nominating Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court, President Trump is once again putting Americans\u2019 health care at risk \u2013 this time during a deadly pandemic that has already killed more than 210,000 Americans. Instead of listening to the American people who, most polls say, overwhelmingly want the person elected president on Nov. 3 to select Justice Ginsburg\u2019s replacement, Republicans are once again trying to change the subject from what\u2019s at stake for everyday Americans if Judge Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court and casts the critical vote to overturn the ACA in the middle of a pandemic. Instead of voting on the HEROES Act (the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act), which was first passed by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on May 15, 2020, or the HEROES Act 2.0, which was passed by the Democratic House on October 1, 2020 \u2013 both of which would provide critical coronavirus relief to long-suffering Americans \u2013 McConnell\u2019s Republican-controlled Senate is solely focused on forcing another radical right-wing justice down the throats of the American people. The $3 trillion HEROES Act and the subsequently slimmed-down $2.2 trillion HEROES Act 2.0 are intended to provide hazard pay for frontline health care workers, student debt forgiveness, and assistance to state and local governments. They bolster Medicaid and Medicare, among other essential health and economic relief to Americans suffering through one of the worst health crises in our history. Specifically, the HEROES Act 2.0 aims to address hardships caused by COVID-19 by including a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks and extended $600 weekly unemployment benefits. The Act also allocates $225 billion for schools and childcare, as well as assistance for airlines and the restaurant industry. Also included is a $100 per month increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in most states, rental assistance, and an ACA premium subsidy.\u00a0This means that Americans who lost jobs during the pandemic would be eligible for the maximum $1,386 health insurance premium subsidy under the ACA. So what is the status of these bills in the U.S. Senate?\u00a0DOA.\u00a0 Dead on Arrival at McConnell\u2019s desk.\u00a0And with Trump flip-flopping every single day on whether he wants Republicans to support coronavirus relief for the American people, these bills are unlikely to go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. Instead, between now and Election Day, the only thing Trump, McConnell, and Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, care about is confirming Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court. That\u2019s it. Confirm a justice who\u2019ll take away American\u2019s health care, rather than pass a coronavirus relief bill to protect American\u2019s lives and livelihoods. This Republican obsession with packing the Supreme Court with another radical conservative judge is antithetical to the safety and security of the American people. So what is Trump and McConnell\u2019s strategy to pursue their shameful plot to subvert the will of the American people?\u00a0As always, distract and deflect. DISTRACT Distract from Republicans\u2019 utter lack of principles on judicial nominations by slandering Democrats with imaginary issues about the number of judges on our courts. But we will not be distracted! We will not forget that it\u2019s Republicans, not Democrats, who have changed the number of judges on our federal courts. Specifically, in 2016 Republicans blocked an eminently qualified and moderate Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for almost a year, long before Election Day. Some Republicans even said that if Hillary Clinton became president, they would\u00a0never allow that vacancy to be filled. Other Republicans proposed removing three seats from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sometimes called \u201cthe little supreme court,\u201d and held-open federal court judgeships\u00a0for years\u00a0so that President Barack Obama could not fill them. I\u2019ll put it to you this way: Republicans don\u2019t care about the number of federal judges, as long as those judges are right-wing radical conservatives. DEFLECT Deflect from Republicans\u2019 deeply unpopular policies by achieving through the Supreme Court what they cannot achieve through bipartisan governing.\u00a0To use Judge Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court to, in Trump\u2019s own words, \u201cterminate\u201d the ACA, strip women of their reproductive rights by overturning Roe v. Wade, undermine protections for workers, and reverse hard-fought gains for LGBTQ Americans. If Trump and McConnell\u2019s plot to confirm Judge Barrett is successful, every American would stand to lose vital health care protections, seniors would see drug costs skyrocket, families would lose health coverage during a pandemic, and women could be charged more than men for insurance simply because they are women.

CRUZ INSISTS TRUMP STILL HAS PATH TO VICTORY, CLAIMS VOTE COUNT LAWSUITS COULD 'EASILY' REACH SUPREME COURT \"What I think is going on here, George, is that this is all premature. This is a premature conversation because we have not finished counting votes,\" Noem said. \"There are states that have not been called, and back in 2000, Al Gore was given his day in court. We should give President Trump his day in court.\" Host George Stephanopolous pointed out that despite the president's assertions of wrongdoing at the polls, Republican state officials\u00a0have \"come up with zero evidence of widespread fraud.\" Noem dismissed his claim as \"absolutely not true\" and urged voters to let the legal process unfold. \"People have signed legal documents, affidavits stating that they saw illegal activities,\" she argued. \"And that is why we need to have this conversation in court. The New York Times itself said that there were clerical errors.\" Noem brought up the example of an\u00a0error in a Michigan county, where several thousand Trump votes were counted for Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. \"If you look at what happened in Michigan, that we had computer glitches that changed Republican votes to Democrat votes,\" she explained. \"You look in Pennsylvania, dead people voted in Pennsylvania. So, George, I don\u2019t know how widespread it is. I don\u2019t know if it will change the outcome of the election. But why is everybody so scared just to have a fair election and find out?\" Noem again referenced\u00a0the fight over the Nov. 7, 2000 presidential election in Florida that finally came to an end when the high court ruled the next month that\u00a0Bush defeated Gore in the state by just 537 votes out of nearly 6 million cast.

LIBERAL, DARK MONEY FUNDED COURIER NEWSROOM TARGETS BATTLEGROUND STATES' VOTERS WITH DEMOCRATIC TALKING POINTS BILLED AS NEWS The CRC first reported last year on what it described as a shadowy network of liberal nonprofits under the banner of Washington-based Arabella Advisors -- afloat on\u00a0more than a half-billion dollars and run by former Clinton administration appointee Eric Kessler. CRC's latest report, released Friday, found that between 2006 and 2018, the Arabella network reported revenues of $2.4 billion and nearly $1.9 billion in expenditures. In 2018 alone, the network brought in $635 million in revenue, after having brought in $582 million a year earlier. The report notes that the revenues alone eclipse those of conservative groups, such as the Heritage Foundation ($82 million in revenue in 2018) and Americans for Prosperity ($58 million.) \u201cIn contrast, the Arabella network brought in almost eight times more than Heritage and 11 times more than Americans for Prosperity,\" the report says. The CRC report describes how Arabella Advisors \u201ccreated and actively manages four nonprofits\u201d -- New Venture Fund, Sixteen Thirty Fund, Hopewell Fund\u00a0and Windward Fund. \u201cEach plays a slightly different role in the network, but all share the same basic functions\u2014sponsoring pop-up groups (also called \u201cprojects\u201d) and paying out grants to other left-wing nonprofits,\u201d the report says. Those pop-up groups are often activist\u00a0websites that can \u201cpop up\u201d one day and disappear\u00a0the next, allegedly to give the appearance of grassroots campaigning for a political cause. Arabella Advisors, in a statement to Fox News, pushed back on what it described as a \u201cgross mischaracterization\u201d by CRC of its work and the client organizations. \u201cArabella Advisors is a consulting business that supports effective philanthropy and impact investing,\u201d spokesperson Steve Sampson said. \u201cOur clients include a variety of nonprofit organizations that hire Arabella for shared administrative services, including the New Venture Fund, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the Hopewell Fund, and the Windward Fund.\u201d \u201cThese nonprofits make grants to a range of projects across the ideological spectrum, most of which have nothing to do with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cArabella Advisors is not the source of funding for any of these organizations, and we do not exert control over the spending decisions of our clients.\u201d One of those organizations in the network, The Sixteen Thirty Fund,\u00a0was reported on by Politico last year when the outlet noted that it spent $141 million on more than 100 left-wing causes during the midterm election year -- on everything from pushing back against the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to weighing in on voting laws and minimum wage ballot measures. It described it as an \"unprecedented gusher of secret money\" that boosted Democrats and liberal causes. A single donation was $51.7 million, which Politico reported was by itself more than it ever raised in an entire year before President Trump was elected. But, as the report noted, federal law does not require \u201csocial welfare\u201d-focused nonprofits to reveal donors. The CRC report is more blunt and describes The Sixteen Thirty Fund as \u201cthe lobbying shop for the Arabella network.\u201d Separately it describes the organization as a \u201ctool for the professional Left, created by Arabella Advisors with funding from some of the biggest organizations in Progressive activism.\u201d The Sixteen Thirty Fund\u00a0pushed back on that assessment in a statement to Fox News, saying it was \u201ccompletely false\u201d for the CRC to describe it as the \u201clobbying shop\u201d for Arabella. \u201cThe Sixteen Thirty Fund is confronting the biggest social challenges in our country through fiscal sponsorship, advocacy and electoral action like many other 501c4 organizations, and we are committed to following the current laws to level the playing field for progressives in this election,\u201d Executive Director Amy Kurtz told Fox News in a statement. The report says that Arabella has tried to deflect scrutiny by claiming it sponsors philanthropic activity, not political activism, \u201cyet its definition of 'charity'\u00a0nearly always involves changing public policy.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s blunt that the Arabella empire provides a model of how to push every edge of the legal envelope in order to score political victories by blending nonprofits and for-profits.\u201d 'SHADOWY' DARK MONEY NETWORK BEHIND LEFT-WING CAUSES EXPOSED IN NEW REPORT It says that while some of the nonprofits support \u201cgenuinely charitable causes\u201d -- noting New Venture Fund donated to a substance abuse and mental nonprofit in Alaska --\u00a0that is a relative fraction of the work. \u201cThe rest are the Left\u2019s bread-and-butter political groups,\u201d the report\u00a0says, noting contributions to what it describes as left-wing voter turnout groups including When We All Vote -- whose co-chairs include former first lady Michelle Obama and ex-White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. A spokesman of one of the groups named as part of the Arabella Network, the Hopewell Fund, described itself as an organization \u201cthat works toward creating a more equitable world through fiscal sponsorship, charitable initiatives, and grant-making.\u201d \"Hopewell Fund focuses on issues relating to poverty, lack of access to education, gender barriers to advancement, and more, in the United States,\" the spokesperson said. \u201cHopewell acts as a fiscal sponsor to smaller and newer organizations that require operational expertise and do not yet have nonprofit status.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lee Bodner, president of the Venture Fund Group, said the report is \u201chyperbolic, hypocritical and paints a misleading picture of our work.\u201d \u201cThe New Venture Fund does not support or oppose any political candidates or parties. We are a non-partisan nonprofit organization that incubates and accelerates philanthropic projects. Our mission is to help nonprofit leaders make the world healthier and more equitable,\" he said in a statement. \"To allow them to focus on the work at hand, we offer fiscal sponsorship, which means we provide them tools and administrative support including human resources, legal, accounting and compliance services, enabling them to get off the ground quickly and operate more efficiently.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino on what's next for the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has prompted widespread debate that too often floats above the historical record and misconstrues the facts surrounding the confirmation of Supreme Court justices during presidential election years. There is no historical reason that the president should not nominate and the Senate should not confirm a new justice without delay, returning the highest court to its full complement. First, contrary to some of the initial prognostication, there is plenty of time to thoroughly vet and confirm a new justice by Election Day. Just consider three jurists from across the spectrum of judicial ideology, appointed by presidents of both parties. TOM FITTON: SUPREME COURT VACANCY \u2013 IF DEMS CAN IMPEACH IN AN ELECTION YEAR, TRUMP CAN DO THIS In 1975, Justice John Paul Stevens was confirmed just 16 days after his nomination was submitted to the Senate. In 1981, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was confirmed in just 33 days.\u00a0 And in 1993, Justice Ginsburg was confirmed in just 42 days.\u00a0 The nomination process in those instances was a credit to the Senate, in contrast to so many others. Second, the Republican position on filling Supreme Court vacancies during a presidential election year is consistent with historical norms and presents no hurdle to confirming the next justice.\u00a0Unsurprisingly, if the Senate is of the same party as the president, his nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed. And if it is of an opposing party, chances of confirmation are comparatively slim. JOHN YOO: CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT MAJORITY? WHAT IT COULD MEAN ON THESE ISSUES During the past presidential election, with a Republican majority in the Senate and a Democrat in the White House, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced\u00a0on the day of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death that the Senate should not fill the vacancy until after the election.\u00a0 He did not waver after Merrick Garland was nominated. In 2016, President Donald Trump was elected because of his transparency on future Supreme Court nominations and his commitment to putting constitutionalist justices on the Supreme Court.\u00a0Indeed, one out of five voters said the Supreme Court was the most important issue for them in the election, and those voters overwhelmingly chose President Trump. Then, in 2018, against the backdrop of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, the American people once again delivered an expanded Republican majority in the Senate. The expansion of the Republican majority in 2018 is critical because which party (the president\u2019s or the opposition\u2019s) controls the Senate has been the prime determinant of whether a vacancy arising in an election year gets filled before the end of the president\u2019s term. Unsurprisingly, if the Senate is of the same party as the president, his nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed. And if it is of an opposing party, chances of confirmation are comparatively slim. LIZ PEEK: CONFIRM SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOW \u2013 4 REASONS WHY TRUMP, REPUBLICANS SHOULD ACT QUICKLY There have been ten vacancies that have arisen on the Court during presidential election years with a Senate and White House controlled by the same party, excluding vacancies filled during an election year that occurred the previous year. Eight of those were confirmed before the end of the presidential term.\u00a0And the two vacancies not filled by a same-party-controlled Senate faced unusual circumstances. James Buchanan waited over eight months after the death of Justice Peter Daniel in 1860 to nominate Jeremiah Black, by which time so many Democrats had withdrawn during the secession crisis that the Senate majority was lost. And Lyndon Johnson\u2019s nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to replace Earl Warren as chief justice was filibustered in reaction to the Warren Court and amid ethical questions surrounding Fortas. Six other election-year\u00a0vacancies on the Court occurred while the Senate was\u00a0controlled by the opposition party (excluding Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s recess appointment of William Brennan). Naturally, they faced significant opposition in light of the divide in government.\u00a0 In four of those six cases, all of which involved the deaths of sitting justices, the vacancies were not filled until the next president took office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In 1828, the Senate voted to postpone John Quincy Adams\u2019 nomination of John Crittenden. Between 1844 and 1845, John Tyler made three nominations\u2014including two of the same man\u2014but the Whig Senate didn\u2019t even proceed to a single confirmation vote (the party had publicly disowned Tyler). In 1852, Millard Fillmore also made three nominations, this time of three different men. \u00a0None of them got a confirmation vote. And then, of course, there was Obama\u2019s nomination of Garland, which met a similar fate. Only two of the six nominations for election-year vacancies were successful with opposition Senates, and both occurred during the 1880s.\u00a0William Woods was nominated by Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 and confirmed to replace Justice William Strong, but it bears consideration that Strong had retired after Republican James Garfield\u2019s election victory that same year. In the only such instance in which the opposition party had something to lose, Democrat Grover Cleveland\u2019s nominee, Melville Fuller, got enough Republican votes in 1888 to be confirmed to succeed Chief Justice Morrison Waite. So to sum up, the Senate has filled election-year Supreme Court vacancies 4/5 of the times when the Senate and White House were controlled by the same party, but only 1/3 of the times when they were divided. Even if the number of historical precedents is cut to eliminate six nominations that occurred after election days had passed\u2014in 1801, 1828, 1861, 1864, 1872, and 1880\u2014the patterns would hold. With same-party control, five of six pre-election nominations were confirmed, as opposed to only one of four with divided control.

            "article_content": " Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has defeated President\u00a0Trump, denying him\u00a0a second term\u00a0after a bitter campaign and dramatic, prolonged vote count in battleground states that sparked a flurry of lawsuits. The Fox News Decision Desk projected Saturday that Biden will win the state of Nevada and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, giving the former vice president the electoral votes he needs to win the White House. ELECTION 2020 LIVE UPDATES: FOX NEWS PROJECTS BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY \"I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris,\" Biden said in a statement. \"In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America.\"He added: \"With the campaign over, it\u2019s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.\" Biden's campaign announced that the president-elect and Harris, his running mate, will speak at an event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware at 8 p.m. ET. A year and a half after launching his White House bid, Biden secured enough states to put him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes and bring an end to the four game-changing years of the Trump presidency, according to the Fox News projections. For Trump, the defeat\u00a0comes four years after a stunning upset \u2013 when he came from behind in 2016 and outperformed the polls in a victory against Hillary Clinton. But in a statement Saturday, Trump did not concede and instead vowed to continue to fight. \u201cThe simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,\u201d the president said. \u201cBeginning Monday,\u00a0our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,\u201d Trump added. The president has launched a number\u00a0of legal challenges\u00a0over ballot counting in key battleground states, with his campaign filing suits in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada as the states continue to tally ballots\u00a0sent by mail. Trump, his campaign and surrogates have spread allegations of fraud in the voting and ballot counting in various states, although solid proof of it has not emerged. In addition, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state signaled Friday that the state is headed toward a recount, given the razor-thin margin of votes there favoring Biden. Biden, taking to Twitter after the projections, said \u201cAmerica, I\u2019m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans \u2014 whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.\u201d And Biden added \u201cPresident-Elect\u201d to the description on his Twitter page. Harris, who will become the first female vice president and first person of color to serve as vice president, tweeted \u201cWe did it.\u201d The senator from California\u2019s tweet included a short video of her on a phone call congratulating Biden. On Friday, the former vice president touted the record-breaking 74 million votes for the Democratic ticket and emphasized that \"the people spoke\u00a0loudly for our ticket.\" Biden highlighted that a \"record number of Americans of all races, faiths, religions, chose change over more of the same. They\u2019ve given us a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, climate change, systemic racism. They\u2019ve made it clear they want the country to come together.\" But many Republicans question the strength of Biden's mandate. Trump won more than 70 million votes, and as of late Friday night Biden's national popular vote margin over the president stood at just under 3 points. And while Biden moved closer to winning the White House, the Democrats' chances of retaking the Senate majority remained slim. Democrats did hold onto control of the House\u00a0but failed to meet expectations of padding their majority. About an hour after the news networks projected Biden\u2019s presidential election victory, he received a congratulatory call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. With strong focus on coronavirus since the worst pandemic in a century swept across the nation eight months ago, Biden was able to keep the spotlight on the president\u2019s record, largely preventing Trump from making the 2020 campaign a choice election. Amid national protests and unrest over racial inequity and another nasty Supreme Court nomination battle in the closing days of the campaign, Biden kept his eye on the pandemic and an economy hit hard by it. TRUMP VOWS TO KEEP \u2018FIGHTING,\u2019 WILL USE \u2018EVERY ASPECT OF THE LAW\u2019 IN BALLOT-COUNTING BATTLE Biden, who laid low for the first couple of months after the pandemic forced Americans to self-isolate, was ridiculed by the president,\u00a0who claimed he was \u201chiding\u201d in his basement at his home in Wilmington, Del. But ultimately the strategy worked -- keeping the electorate\u2019s focus on the president's handling of the worsening crisis. Also highlighting Trump\u2019s divisive style of governing, the Democrat pledged to be a uniter willing to reach across the aisle to find common ground. Biden was able to resist withering attacks by Trump and his surrogates over his record in politics stretching nearly half a century. He also deflected a barrage of attacks\u00a0targeting him and his son, Hunter, that accused the Biden family of\u00a0unsubstantiated \u201ccorruption.\u201d The road ahead for the\u00a0president-elect, who will soon turn 78,\u00a0will be far from easy. He must cope with titanic challenges never faced to this magnitude by an incoming commander in chief. Compounding the enormous task\u00a0ahead, Biden likely will have to deal with a Republican Party that may be in no mood to compromise \u2013 and with a progressive base of his own party that will almost certainly try to push the incoming president to the left. Biden\u2019s victory comes five years after he passed on a White House run, as he reeled from the death of his eldest son, Beau. A year later, Clinton narrowly lost numerous key battleground states to Trump due in part to a drop in support from White working class voters as well as a lack of enthusiasm from Black and Latino voters. But Biden \u2013 who\u2019s long been known as \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d because of his roots growing up in a working-class family in Scranton, Pa., and later in Delaware, and who served for eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, America\u2019s first Black president -- was able to succeed where Clinton failed. For Biden, who made unsuccessful White House bids in 1988 and 2008, the third time was the charm. BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM'S WORK UNDERWAY \"The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America\u00a0is at stake,\u201d Biden said\u00a0as he announced his candidacy for president in April of last year, ending months of intrigue and media speculation. Biden entered a record-setting, jam-packed field of contenders for the nomination and\u00a0repeatedly took attacks from his more progressive rivals over his stance on the issues and his record during his four-plus decades as a senator from Delaware and vice president in the Obama administration. During summer and fall 2019, Biden was in the line of fire as the front-runner in the race. Biden, who had struggled with fundraising since his campaign launch, saw his standing in the polls deteriorate at the end of last year and early this year, as progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, soared. The former vice president appeared on the ropes in February, after disappointing showings in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the first two contests in the presidential nomination calendar. But a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary on the last day of February, followed by sweeping victories three days later in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday contests, vaulted Biden back to front-runner status. Most of his rivals quickly dropped out of the race as moderates and establishment Democrats rallied around Biden. After a continued streak of primary victories in March and early April, Sanders \u2013 Biden\u2019s last rival for the nomination \u2013 ended his bid and endorsed his rival. Biden entered a general election contest against Trump badly behind the GOP incumbent in the crucial fundraising and campaign organization metrics. At the same time, the White House race instantly was upended as the pandemic swept the nation, forcing millions to self-isolate and shuttering major parts of the economy, triggering the worst recession since the Great Depression eight decades ago. GEORGIA SENATE RACE: PERDUE, OSSOFF HEAD TO RUNOFF AFTER HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGN As Biden was working to unite the Democrats following a bruising primary, the general showdown between him and Trump instantly became a referendum on the president\u2019s handling of the pandemic and the economy, giving Biden a race he could win. Biden spent the remainder of the spring, summer and fall\u00a0continuously pillorying the president\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus and revive the economy, and spelling out his proposals. The president had been raising money for his reelection ever since he took over\u00a0the White House in January 2017, and he enjoyed a massive early fundraising advantage. As Trump started airing\u00a0ads on TV in the key battlegrounds, Biden remained dark. The Democrat\u00a0didn\u2019t make his first major ad buy on television until the middle of June. But\u00a0thanks in part to a\u00a0surge in fundraising in\u00a0late spring through\u00a0summer, including record-shattering campaign cash hauls in August and September, Biden dramatically outraised the president as the general election heated up -- and he outspent Trump on TV ads the past three months. In the digital ad wars, Biden also enjoyed a slight spending advantage. Biden held his own in both presidential debates \u2013 disproving the repeated attacks by Trump and his campaign questioning the 77-year old nominee\u2019s mental acuity. And, Trump\u2019s brief hospitalization after contracting COVID-19, as well an autumn surge in the coronavirus in key states across the country, kept the campaign\u2019s spotlight firmly on an issue that did no favors for the president\u2019s reelection chances. The final stretch of the campaign saw Biden playing offense and the president on defense \u2013 with most of the campaign stops in states Trump narrowly captured in 2016. Biden\u2019s closing themes were the same as those he used when he announced his candidacy. \"The heart and soul of this country\u2019s at stake,\u201d Biden told Florida voters during a stop in Broward County last week as he promised to bring compassion and empathy back to the White House. And, Biden continued to emphasize his goal to unite the nation, repeatedly stressing that \u201cI\u2019m running as a proud Democrat but I\u2019ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. I\u2019ll work as hard for those who didn\u2019t support me as those who do. That\u2019s the job of the president: a duty of caring, caring for everyone.\u201d Taking aim at the president\u2019s war of words with many of the nation\u2019s leading public health officials, Biden highlighted that \u201cwe choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, and we choose science over fiction, and yes, we choose truth over lies.\u201d Biden now has two and a half months to assemble a cabinet and top officials who instantly will have to cope with the biggest\u00a0challenges ever faced by an incoming president and administration \u2013 from the worst pandemic to strike the world in a century, and the worst economic recession to grip the nation since The Great Depression eight decades ago. Biden will be squeezed from both sides \u2013 by reeling Republicans who may look to run the same playbook that stymied President Obama and Biden as they took over in the White House in 2009. But, he\u2019ll also face pressure from his left flank. The left will be looking for top progressives to land leading roles in Biden\u2019s administration, and will be pushing hard to implement their agenda on the economy, social justice, civil rights\u00a0and judicial reform, and on combating climate change. Firebrand lawmakers on the left \u2013 such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\u00a0\u2013 kept the peace during the general election, but with the Democrats\u2019 common foe now defeated \u2013\u00a0infighting may soon commence, with the left scrutinizing every move by a politician firmly planted in the center-left of the party. Also hovering over Biden: questions over his durability and whether he\u2019ll run for re-election in four years. The last thing the president-elect needs at the onset of his tenure in the White House is to be collared with lame-duck status. Biden hasn\u2019t ruled out seeking\u00a0a second term. Asked in August if he was open to running for re-election, he said \u201cabsolutely,\u201d in an interview with ABC News.",

            "article_content": "Biden trying to drum up support from Hispanic voters; Steve Harrigan reports. Pennsylvania election officials sounded the alarm that thousands of\u00a0votes could be tossed out in November following a state Supreme Court ruling last week that \"naked ballots\" cannot be counted. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Thursday that officials in the battleground state can reject\u00a0mail-in ballots sent without a secrecy envelope,\u00a0which prevents the poll workers from seeing how someone voted. The ruling rescinded previous guidance allowing counties to count\u00a0\"naked ballots.\" More than 100,000 ballots could be thrown out as a result of the decision, according to\u00a0Lisa Deeley, the chair of the Philadelphia city commissioners. President Trump won Pennsylvania by just over\u00a044,000 votes during the 2016 election. PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT EXTENDS STATE MAIL BALLOT DEADLINE TO 3 DAYS AFTER ELECTION In a letter\u00a0sent to Republican leaders in the state legislature on Monday, Deeley called on lawmakers to take up urgent legislative action to eliminate the secrecy envelope requirement for mail-in ballots, warning it could cause \"election chaos.\" \"Recent action by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have set Pennsylvania up to be the subject of significant post-election legal controversy, the likes of which we have not seen since Florida in 2000,\" Deeley wrote, referring to a monthlong\u00a0recount battle\u00a0between Al Gore and George W. Bush that ended only with Supreme Court intervention. Pennsylvania is\u00a0one of only 16 states\u00a0that still requires a secrecy envelope. \"This is not a partisan issue,\" wrote Deeley, a Democrat. \"We are talking about the voting rights of our constituents, whether they be Democrats, Republicans, or independents, whose ballots will be needlessly set aside. As public servants, we owe it to all citizens to avoid this situation, and the likely chaos that would come with it.\" MICHIGAN JUDGE SAYS BALLOTS RECEIVED WITHIN 14 DAYS OF ELECTION SHOULD COUNT IF POSTMARKED ON TIME In an email to Fox News, Mike Straub, a spokesperson for\u00a0Rep. Bryan Cutler, a Republican and the leader of the state's House of Representatives, rejected the argument that not accepting\u00a0naked ballots could cause Election Day chaos and called the Supreme Court's decision \"clear and fair.\" \"The secrecy envelopes are not new,\" Straub said. \"The directions for correctly returning your ballot are provided to every voter who applies to vote by mail. These rules have existed as long as mail-in voting has existed in Pennsylvania (as in longer than the expansion last fall). It is not new to the counties. It serves an important step in preserving the privacy of the voter \u2013 as the courts agreed.\" A spokesperson for Senate president pro tempore Joe Scarnati did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's unclear how many ballots could be thrown out as a result of the court's order. This is the first election in which every Pennsylvania voter will be eligible to vote by mail. In her letter, Deeley said\u00a0that 6.4% of absentee ballots in the state\u2019s 2019 general election did not have secrecy envelopes. Based on those figures, she estimated that up to\u00a040,000 ballots could be tossed in Philadelphia alone. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Millions of Americans are expected to\u00a0vote by mail this November due to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing the chances the\u00a0winner of the presidential race won't immediately be known on election night. State election officials in several key battleground states have warned it could take days to count all of the votes. Trump has repeatedly claimed--without evidence--that mail-in voting would allow for widespread fraud. According to an aggregate of polls from RealClearPolitics, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is leading Trump by 3.8 percentage points in Pennsylvania. Although the ruling on naked ballots was viewed as a loss for Democrats, who are\u00a0projected to vote by mail at a higher rate than Republicans, the state Supreme Court handed down a series of other decisions that could benefit the party. For instance, the court removed Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins from the general election ballot, potentially helping Biden. The Democratic-controlled court also ruled that drop boxes are permitted and mail ballots must be counted if they are received three days after Nov. 3, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.",

            "article_content": "Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock, contributing editor for the National Review Online, joins 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' The Biden campaign has been quietly building a massive \"election protection program,\" including\u00a0former Attorney General Eric Holder and hundreds of other lawyers\u00a0in preparation for a legal battle in the event of a contested election. The former vice president\u2019s campaign told Fox News Monday that over the past several months\u00a0they have created the largest election protection program in presidential campaign history, involving integrated legal, communications and political strategies for what they anticipate to be an unprecedented election. TRUMP CAMPAIGN\u00a0BRACING FOR LEGAL BATTLE OVER ELECTION, FORMING 'COALITION' OF LAWYERS The strategies, according to the campaign, are being directed to support\u00a0election jurisdictions in preparing for and administering the vote under what they call \u201cextraordinary conditions\u201d this cycle, voter education to raise awareness of options for in-person and mail-in voting, aggressive responses to vote suppression activities, and robust programs for identifying and countering foreign interference\u00a0and misinformation from foreign or domestic sources. The campaign said Bob Bauer has signed on\u00a0full-time as a senior campaign adviser. He is\u00a0on leave from the faculty of NYU Law School, and will work on the voter protection program with the campaign\u2019s general counsel, Dana Remus. Bauer served as general counsel to the Obama-Biden campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and co-chair of former President Obama's Presidential Commission on Election Administration. Remus has oversight of the campaign\u2019s day-to-day legal operations, and will oversee the wide-ranging team of lawyers to address voter protection. The effort, according to the campaign, includes a national team for special litigation, whose leaders include former Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger, and a team at the law firm Perkins Coie, which is headed by Marc Elias. Those lawyers will focus state-by-state on protecting voter access to the polls and a \u201cfair and accurate vote count.\u201d A campaign source told Fox News that they will communicate and interact with all stakeholders in voting rights, but that\u00a0Holder would play a leading role in the outreach program. The source also stressed that while the legal program has brought on hundreds of lawyers, thousands of lawyers and volunteers are involved in their broader voter protection program. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Jr. speaks during the National Action Network Convention in New York, April 3, 2019. (AP) The\u00a0Biden campaign\u2019s legal team moves were first reported by The New York Times. TRUMP URGES VOTERS TO CHECK MAIL-IN BALLOTS COUNTED AFTER SAYING THEY SHOULD TRY TO VOTE TWICE Meanwhile, President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, also bracing for the possibility of a protracted legal battle, formed what it\u2019s called \u201cLawyers for Trump,\u201d a coalition to \u201cprotect the integrity\u201d of November\u2019s vote. Trump campaign general counsel Matthew Morgan told Fox News earlier this month that the campaign is urging active and retired attorneys\u00a0and even law students to volunteer in their nationwide efforts. \u201cDemocrats are working to shred election integrity measures one state at a time, and there\u2019s no question they\u2019ll continue their shenanigans from now to November and beyond,\u201d Morgan told Fox News. \u201cThe Trump campaign is fighting to ensure every valid ballot across America counts \u2013 once.\u201d He added that the Lawyers for Trump coalition is growing \u201cdaily\u201d and \u201cwill rally support for President Trump as they lend their time and legal expertise to protect the integrity of November\u2019s election.\u201d JOE CONCHA: BIDEN IS 'PURSUING THE HIGHEST OFFICE' BY 'PLEADING THE FIFTH' The coalition is being led by Texas\u00a0Attorney General Ken Paxton and Arkansas\u00a0Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, as well as California\u00a0Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon and former Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino. The group includes prominent Trump-allied attorneys like former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, former Attorney General Ed Meese and\u00a0the president's personal attorney\u00a0Rudy Giuliani. The Lawyers for Trump coalition comes as part of the joint Republican National Committee and Trump campaign's \"Protect the Vote\" effort, which has warned for months that \"Democrats are trying to use coronavirus and the courts to legalize ballot harvesting, implement a nationwide mail-in ballot system, and eliminate nearly every safeguard in our elections.\" The campaign\u2019s efforts come amid a fierce war of words between the Trump and Biden campaigns and their allies over the integrity of the vote \u2013\u00a0covering everything from GOP warnings about mail-in voting to Democrats' predictions that Trump would refuse to accept a loss. Republicans, for their part, warn there is a potential for widespread fraud and confusion\u00a0in November\u2019s election due to the unprecedented scale of mail-in ballots in states across the nation.

In another case, which Rufo discussed with Carlson last month,\u00a0Sandia National Laboratories, which designs nuclear weapons, sent its white male executives to a mandatory training in which they, according to Rufo, wrote letters apologizing to women and people of color.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, Tucker. And, by the way, we echo your thoughts and prayers to Hope Hicks and anybody who's had to deal with this virus, the families, and everybody. Thank you. All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". Tonight, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, will join us live for an exclusive one-on-one interview. That is coming up. Earlier tonight, as Tucker just mentioned, he delivered a speech at the Al Smith Dinner where he defended Judge Amy Coney Barrett from the despicable, disgusting attacks on her faith. Let's take a look at that part. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To protect your God-given rights, I was recently honored to nominate one of our most brilliant legal minds, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to the United States Supreme Court and that was an honor indeed. We will not stand for any attacks against Judge Barrett's faith. Anti- Catholic bigotry has absolutely no place in the United States of America. It predominates in the Democrat Party and we must do something immediately about it, like a Republican win. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: We're going to have a lot more on that later when the president joins us live. First, it is 33 days, you are the ultimate jury, the time for urgency is right now. And yeah, I'm sounding an alarm as forcefully as I possibly can. This election is not just about President Trump and Joe Biden, Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals. Nope, it's deeper than that. This is a tipping point. This is about preserving, protecting our liberty, our freedom, capitalism, preserving this great constitutional republic. In other words, what is at stake, what is in your hands in 33 days -- well, now, too, if you're doing early voting, it's about protecting this great country, greatest country God ever gave man from those that would like to now turn it on its head. If you value your First Amendment, your Second Amendment rights, if you believe in co-equal branches of government and checks and balances in your government, listen up, because here is 2020 game plan of this new, radical, extreme Democratic socialist party. They are planning to seize control of the U.S. Supreme Court with the corrupt practice known as court packing. FDR was the last person to try this. Now, if they are successful, Democrats would add additional Supreme Court justices until a favorable majority that believe in judicial activism and legislating from the bench is achieved. In other words, so that they can ram through their radical agenda without any check or balance or any resistance. Now, the practice is so unethical, so crooked, Joe Biden just flat out refuses to answer whether or not he supports this. And time after time, Joe just says he's not going to answer the question. I'm not taking the Trump bait. No, Joe, America needs to know, where do you stand on this all-important pivotal constitutional issue? Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: You dodged Chris Wallace's question on that last night about packing the court. So let me ask you. Do you support the idea of packing the court? JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm not dodging the question. What I'm doing is staying focused. You know, and I'm not being critical of you at all, I've given my word. But if I answer the question, no matter which way I answer it, then that becomes the headline tomorrow, that becomes the headline for the next three years, the presidential nominee says he's going to or not going to do the following. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Joe, you are dodging, answer the question, America has a right to know before they vote. We have a presidential candidate who will not answer questions, commit to whether or not he would support what would be a hostile takeover of a co- equal branch of government. His non-answer -- well, probably the truth is in that answer, and that would be and we must then therefore conclude that he clearly does support this radical idea and being controlled and surrounded by radicals, we better believe that he will do it. Unconscionable, but he'll do it. Court packing, that is only one part of the Democratic plan to seize power. Now what I'm about to say is not an exaggeration. There is literally now nothing Democrats won't do to rig the system in their favor. For example, adding four more solid blue Senate seats by giving D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood. Would they do it? Absolutely. They want a Democratic Senate majority clearly in perpetuity. In other words, they would end the legislative filibuster as well. If Democrats win the majority in the Senate, you bet they go there also. Eliminating the all-important Electoral College, will you answer that question, Joe? Because according to the Senate Minority Leader Chucky Schumer, he's saying all of this is on the table. He's admitting it. He's saying what Joe won't say. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They have ruined the Senate. We are using all the tactics we can to slow the thing down. JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Would that include adding if the Senate becomes a Democratic majority, adding D.C. and Puerto Rico as states and ending the filibuster? SCHUMER: I would -- believe me, on D.C. and Puerto Rico, particularly if Puerto Rico votes for it, D.C. already has voted for it and want it. I love to make them states. REID: OK. SCHUMER: And as for the filibuster, I didn't -- I'm not busting my chops to become majority leader to do very little or nothing. We are going to get a whole lot done. And as I've said, everything, everything is on the table. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood, what about the other 50 states? Do they have a say in that? We're going to end the legislative filibuster, pack the courts? Listen to Chuck, he means it. They will turn our entire constitutional system on its head and what will be the biggest most corrupt power grab in the history of this country, ending the legislative filibuster, they will do that. Make no mistake, Schumer, California, New York, they would love to -- guess what -- they get to decide who every president would be if they got rid of the Electoral College. That'll be exactly what happens next. Schumer, Pelosi, Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, they will do all of this and more, and Joe won't tell us whether he supports it or not. Now, of course, Democrats know their illicit power grab will not sit well with most Americans in the other states. Now, they know they're sleazy, unconstitutional, they corrupt, so they are hoping to distract you the American people with one of their favorite election tactics, but with a twist. No matter how many times President Trump disavows, condemns white supremacy, hate groups, the left pretends like it never happened, and he needs to say it again and again and again. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it? BIDEN: I totally disavow the Ku Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke. BIDEN: I got back in this race because what happened in Charlottesville. People coming out of the woods carrying torches, their veins bulging. Close your eyes and remember what you saw. And a young woman gets killed resisting the hate and violence, and the president gets asked to come in and what's he say? He says they're very fine people on both sides. TRUMP: And you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. BIDEN: You wouldn't even condemn David Duke for God's sake. TRUMP: I reject David Duke, rejected David Duke. I've rejected the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan from the time I'm five years old, I rejected them. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: So what is Joe Biden doing? He is lying to you. No president in American history has publicly disavowed these things more than Donald Trump. He's called for the KKK to be prosecuted as a terrorist organization. He supported the death penalty for a notorious white supremacist. It was the first federal execution in 17 years. The Democrats, their allies state-run TV, the media mob, they all are lying to you. And as per usual, they will do and say anything for power. So what would our country look like if Democrats are able to win back the White House, the Senate, pack the court? Well, first, there will be two sets of rules, one for the elites and the Democratic Party and the deep state and Hillary Clinton, and another set of rules for \"We, the People\". We saw a nauseating example of this earlier today. In the great state of Pennsylvania, when a Democratic lawmaker caught on a hot mic telling a colleague that she was only wearing a mask for political theater. Apparently, she wants we, the people, to follow her selfless example and she's full of it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TOM WOLF (D-PA): So, Wendy, I'm going to take -- I'm going to take my mask off when I speak, so -- REP. WENDY ULLMAN: I will as well, just, I'm waiting so that we can do a little political theater. (LAUGHTER) ULLMAN: So that it's on camera. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: She was talking to the governor of Pennsylvania, just like the governor in New York and New Jersey that put COVID patients through an executive order into nursing homes, another brilliant governor. Anyway, and the state rep you just heard from, we reached out to her, we reached out to the governor of Pennsylvania. No comment, no response. Meanwhile, Joe Biden had some political theater of his own during the debate. He called the president, let's see, pretty much every nasty name in the book, said the president's a racist. By the way, was it a Joe that was friendly to his mentor and his friend, the former Klansman Byrd? Didn't he partner with Robert Byrd, the guy that's filibustered the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act? Didn't he prep his friend and mentor, and then partnered with him in the late `70s to stop integration of schools, didn't want his kids to go to schools that were racial jungles? Wow, we're going to get lecture from him. He called the president a liar. He called him Putin's puppy. He told the president to shut up repeatedly. But Joe, the fellow Democrats, the media mob, they all have the vapors, they're all -- they're all so upset at what they watched. Our children couldn't even watch it. They were just besides themselves with their selected feigned, phony outrage over the tenor and the tone, but only of President Trump's performance. Naturally, Joe has no regrets about his own conduct. Rules for thee but not for me, right, Joe? Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: You did call the president a, quote, fool, liar, clown, racist, Putin's puppy, and the worst president American has ever had, and you told him to shut up. Do you regret any of that? BIDEN: No. REPORTER: Why not? BIDEN: Because everything I said was true. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Oh, OK. In 33 days, if the Democrats win in November, the double standard will be the least of your worries, which brings us now to a Hannity investigation into Joe Biden's radical agenda. Joe lied repeatedly in Tuesday night's debate. So, tonight, let us be clear, there's no mystery about the scary Democratic platform. It is written down on Biden's official website. Let's start with the Biden plan for a clean energy revolution and environmental justice that reads, quote, Biden believes the New Green Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. Of course, he does. His running mate actually sponsored the Green New Deal in the U.S. Senate. So what does the so-called crucial framework look like? Well, the plan is so insane that in 2019, it was defeated 57-0 in the U.S. Senate, and Kamala Harris, his running mate, was the New Green Deal co-sponsor, she didn't even vote for it. Among other radical proposals, the plan calls for an end of all oil, gas, coal, nuclear energy. it would ban planes, combust -- the combustible engine, kill off cows eventually, ban plastic straws, and retrofit every single building in the country to be environmentally friendly as they define it. And the free government-run health care, they offer that. Free housing, free government healthy food, free everything for everyone. How many millions of Americans lost their doctors and plans, and under Obama-Biden care, well, we're now paying on average as Americans 200 percent more. That's what happens when you promise free everything to everyone, how they're going to keep all those promises they botched up Obamacare as bad as they could. The Green New Deal is not crucial framework for any legitimate policy. At best, it is a wild fever dream fantasy by a few delusional socialists which kind of represents the entire Democratic Party today. But believe it or not, it even gets worse, which brings us to the Bernie Biden manifesto also found on Joe Biden's website and said -- regardless of him denying it. He said, I am the Democratic Party, he said on Tuesday. Well much of the language in the policy proposal was actually lifted word for word from the Sanders campaign -- kind of like a lot of Biden's plagiarism. That's right, one time pariah of the Democratic Party, an outcast, devout socialist, Bernie Sanders, he authored much of Joe Biden's economic policy and that plan calls for the end of cash bail which has been a deadly tragic disaster in places like New York . The plan calls for a massive tax increase for every corporation, including every small business. It will force all employers to provide 12 weeks paid family leave. It raises the federal minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. It increases the payroll tax. It bans the right to work in the United States. In other words, Americans in every state will be forced to join a union before applying for a job. It calls for universal government-run health care, student loan forgiveness, it will massively expand government- subsidized housing, the food stamp program, government-sponsored childcare. So it's not a secret that the Bolshevik Bernie-Biden manifesto calls for a massive transfer of wealth from the private sector to the federal government, and if that is passed into law, that manifesto will devastate free market capitalism in our entire economy. Small, medium-sized businesses will be wiped out and destroyed and millions of American jobs will be lost. This is what the Democrats are proposing. This is who they are believe them. Those who ignore these radical socialist plans will do so at their own peril. This is exactly why we need a fighter in the Oval Office, oh, and they also support open borders, amnesty in the united sanctuary states of America and free health care for illegal immigrants. Now, does President Trump fight tooth-and-nail every day to make the country safer, more prosperous for every American, in every corner of this country? I would say the president's guilty of fighting, yes. Now, when did that become a bad thing, because the president, he's had to fight hard for lower taxes, ending the bureaucracy for peace and prosperity in the Middle East that nobody predicted, the new embassy in Jerusalem. And, by the way, he fought to put an end to endless wars as he promised. He fought to expand America's manufacturing and agriculture industry through fair trade deals all over the world. He fought to improve communities in need with his Opportunity Zones. He fought to increase funding, for example, for historically black colleges in the U.S. He passed criminal justice reform. He passed and used an executive order for police reform. He stood by Justice Kavanaugh and he fought for due process. He also fought against the government abuse of power. He fought for tough travel restrictions from China 10 days after the first identified case of corona, during the pandemic. Liberal Governors Gavin Newsom, even Cuomo, praising him all throughout that crisis and he did it at a time when there was serious -- well, arguments against taking such significant action so early. Donald Trump, is he a fighter who ignited an economic boom? Yeah, guilty, and so yeah, having a fighter in the White House is really a bad thing, Donald Trump fighting is it really horrible or is it that just Joe can't handle it? All right, first, joining us now with analysis, FOX News contributor Karl Rove. Thirty-three days out, Mr. Architect where do we stand, sir? KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, we're in a dog fight and we're already starting to vote in some states and it's going to -- the race is tightened. It needs to tighten more for the president to win and we're in for a horse race. And I want to return to something you brought up at the beginning because I think it's under girding everything in this campaign. You were talking about how at the beginning of the debate, President Trump and -- pushed Joe Biden to come out and say where he was on the issue of ending the filibuster and packing the Supreme Court. And as you recall, he wouldn't answer. He said, quote, whatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue. Well, yeah, right. So, what do we make of that? There are two ways to take that. What positions could he have? One position could be that he's opposed to ending the filibuster and opposed to packing the court, and he doesn't want to say it because he's afraid of irritating the left of his party. I -- I don't -- that's plausible and maybe that's the case but I doubt it. I think the real reason is, is that if he says I'm in favor of packing the court, that means he's going to have to fundamentally change the rules of the United States Senate in a way that will threaten the future prosperity and even the nature of the American experiment. Let me explain that too. First thing you have to do if you want to pack the court is, you have to kill the 60-vote requirement. Right now, in order to take up a measure, there has to be an agreement by 60 members of the House -- or the Senate that they will take up that measure. So you have to kill the 60-vote rule, the so-called filibuster. You then would be able to pack the court. But in reality, you could pack it by having 51 Democrats kill that requirement in the rules, you can then pass a bill to pass the to pack the Supreme Court with less than 60 votes, with 51 or 52 votes. In fact, let's be honest about this. You can pass everything they want, all of those nutty proposals, the Green New Deal, free Medicare, or free -- excuse me, Medicare-for-All, free college, you name it, they could pass it all with 50 votes in the United States Senate and the vice president voting to break a tie. Think about that. Every single one of these nutty socialist schemes could be passed not by forcing Democrats and Republicans to get together and compromise and get the Senate to kind of agree on something that can get the 60-vote threshold. No, no, no, all you got to do is get votes and have Kamala Harris in the -- in the -- in with the gavel and she breaks any time. So you don't even need 51 votes. All you got to do is get to 50, and all of these socialist agenda, everything that is in the 110-page Biden-Sanders unity task force recommendations could be passed into law and nothing could be done about it because they got the votes in the House and 50 votes in the Senate and the vice president of the United States to break a tie and it all becomes law and we may never ever get that's done again, get it undone again. HANNITY: All right. So, Karl, with 33 days, how is it he won't answer. Well, we'll let the people decide? To me, Chuck Schumer revealed that everything's on the table. That would be the legislative filibuster, gone. Packing the courts, done. It would also mean -- well, I'd say all sorts of things statehood for D.C., to Puerto Rico. ROVE: I got a laundry list that you just spent five minutes talking about could be passed just like that because all you need is 50 votes. Look, I think the president United States should simply assume that he got his answer. He would -- Joe Biden is not going to say. So the president ought to say the reason that he's not answering that question is because he intends to do just exactly that. Take away the guard rails, the Constitution, the Founders wrote the Constitution in order to have the Senate be the body that that cools the passions of the House. House elected for two-year terms, senators elected with six-year terms. House originally elected by the people and the Senate elected by their state legislatures. Now are both popularly elected. But there was a deliberate attempt to insulate the Senate so it could slow down things and make things move more slowly and cause the passions to be cooled and do the right thing and force, over the course of time, the two parties to come to an agreement. All gone, every one of those nutty schemes that you just listed out could be passed by 50 votes. The president ought to say, you know what, Joe gave America the answer. He wants to end the 50-vote requirement, end the idea that we have to have compromise in the United States Senate, and grease the skids for passing this radical agenda that's listed in 110 pages of the Biden -- and go online. He said that there is no manifesto, Google Biden, Sanders, unity task force recommendations, and bam. There's the manifesto right there. HANNITY: A hundred and ten pages. Karl Rove, thank you. We have a busy night tonight. The president will join us live in a minute. Also, the great one Mark Levin, he's fired up with a warning. He will explain what will happen if Biden is elected in 33 days, next. (COMMERCILA BREAK) HANNITY: All right. President Trump will join us from the White House in just a moment. First, joining us now to talk about the 2020 election, what will happen to America, God forbid, Biden wins. In 33 days, you are the ultimate jury, the host of \"Life, Liberty, & Levin\", Sunday nights, 8:00 p.m., number one show, by the way, all across cable, in his slot and more, and the best-selling author of \"Unfreedom of the Press\", nationally syndicated radio host, I call him the great one, Mark Levin. Mark, I'm just guessing you probably have a lot to say tonight about all of these topics. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": You know, Sean, first of all, if you go back and you watch the debate between Biden and Paul Ryan, you will see that Biden pulled the same stunt, he's a brawler, he interrupted Ryan over and over and over again, and the media loved it. Ryan got his butt kicked, nice guy, a technical guy, and Biden did exactly the same thing with the weird facial emotions and the laughing and the interrupting and the name, did exactly the same thing. And if you go back and look at the beginning of the debate, you'll also see it was Biden who threw the first punch and interrupted the president repeatedly. But the president's not Paul Ryan, and he wasn't going to put up with it. He had to make a decision am I going to get rolled, or am I going to take him on? But that's not what I want to talk about. They keep asking the president of the United States, which is outrageous, if he'll denounce white supremacy. He's done it 20 times. But I want to honestly speak to the American people and go over the head of the media tonight, and I want you to ask this question, is Joe Biden still a white supremacist? That's right. Is he still a bigot? And I'm going to use Joe Biden's own language, that any moderator, any debate moderator can find, because it took me 40 minutes to dig all this up. 1975, October 12th, quote, Joe Biden, I -- and he said this to \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\": I think the Democratic Party could stand a liberal George Wallace, someone who's not afraid to stand up and offend people, someone who wouldn't pander but would say what the American people know in their gut is right. And he says that also, he's referring to Alabama's notorious George Wallace, also 1975, Joe Biden, quote: I think the concept of busing that we're going to integrate people so that they all have the same access and they learn to grow up with one another and all the rest is a rejection of the whole movement of black pride is a rejection of the entire black awareness concept where black is beautiful, black culture should be studied and the cultural awareness of the importance of their own identity. If that doesn't come close to promoting segregation or opposing integration, 1975, I don't know what does. 1977, from \"The New York Times\", Joe Biden, old comments, he says that non- orderly racial integration, non-orderly racial integration policies would cause his children to grow up in a racial jungle. He then says: Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle. The jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it's going to explode at some point. Joe Biden, 1977, old letters that he wrote to a racist southern Senator James Eastland who was as racist and a bigoted as they get a segregationist Democrat from Mississippi. Quote, 1977, I want you to know that I very much appreciate your help during this week's committee meeting and attempting to bring my anti-busing legislation to a vote. Biden wrote on June 30, 1977, at James Eastland, gee, that was in \"The Washington Post\". I wonder how they forgot about that. Eastland was a plantation owner who believed blacks were an inferior race and forcefully fought desegregation throughout his career as a Democratic lawmaker in Mississippi, and they have letters going back between Biden and Eastland back in 1972 about Biden's friendship with Eastland. Now, let's go to 1987. Biden doing a 1987 fundraising trip across the South for his success -- unsuccessful 1988 presidential bid, Biden sought to appeal to white voters telling audiences that he had received an award from George Wallace in 1973, that the segregationists had lauded him as, quote, one of the outstanding young politicians of America. Joe Biden, 1988, also on the floor of the United States Senate, Biden praised segregationist John Stennis, a racist segregationist from Mississippi as a, quote, man of character. He even said that of Stennis who opposed Brown versus Board of Education was something called the Southern Manifesto. This was a racist manifesto. A lot of these Democrat Southerners had signed on to. In fact, Biden even bragged about Stennis gifting him with the table on which the southern manifesto was signed. Wow. How did the media miss this? This is why we're going over the media's head and communicating with the American people, particularly African Americans and black Americans. 2017, Joe Biden says: I've been around so long, I work with James Eastland, who again was this segregationist from Mississippi. Even in the days when I got there, the Democratic Party still had seven or eight old-fashioned Democratic segregationists. You'd get up, you'd argue like the devil with them, then you go down and have lunch or dinner together. The political system worked. We were divided on issues, but the political system worked. That's Biden. 2019 comments he made about working with segregationist, 2019, Biden been talking about his time working again with Eastland and then Georgia segregationist Herman Talmadge. In the 1970s when he began discussing the relationship, Biden said, I was in a caucus with James Eastland before imitating a Southern accent and claiming that the senator, the senator never called me boy, which is we all know is a derogatory term used against black men. Then the 1994 Biden crime bill, it wasn't just called the crime bill, it was the Biden crime bill. He kind of hides from it now, he was its main author. The Democrat Senate passed that. The Democrat House passed it. The Democrat President Bill Clinton, who also has ties to segregationists, he signed it. But Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Here's what he said: We have predators on our streets that society has, in fact, in part because of its neglect created. He said in the speech on the floor of the House, Biden described a cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally -- because they literally have not been socialized. They literally have not had an opportunity. He said, we should focus on them now because if we don't, they will, or a portion of them will become the predators, 15 years from now. Now, who do you think he's talking about? Biden's 1993 predator remarks were similar to comments made by Hillary Clinton in 1996, where she warned super predators who had no conscience, no empathy and who need to be brought to heal. 2010, oh man, oh man, how is it that he escapes scrutiny for his bigoted, racist past comments coming out of his big mouth. 2010, eulogy for Robert Byrd who founded the Klan of West Virginia. You know, West Virginia had broken off from Virginia during the civil war because it was with the Union. Robert Byrd starts a chapter of the Klan in West Virginia, so excited are the Democrats about him and he filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act, they made him the majority leader in the Democrat Party. And one of his pals was Joe Biden. He fought the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And one of the things he said was to me for a lot of us -- this is at the funeral -- Byrd was a mentor and a friend and for a lot of us, he was a guide. Now, I have a question to ask. Richard Spencer, you ever heard of him? HANNITY: We're about to run here. LEVIN: He's like one of the heads of the neo-Nazi movement or the Klan or something that sort in the United States, you know he endorsed, Sean? He endorsed Joe Biden for president of the United States. You know when our president, Donald Trump, was asked about David Duke, he denounced David Duke, he denounced David Duke, they gave it -- David Duke endorsed you, what do you think about that? He denounced it, he denounced it, over and over and over again in 2016. Richard Spencer is bigger than David Duke in the crackpot, subhuman white supremacist movement and Biden's not asked once what he thinks about that. Now, I want to move on -- HANNITY: Mark, we have -- Mark, we have 30 seconds, Mark. LEVIN: All right. Let me just end with this question, let me just end with this question. Joe Biden, are you still a white supremacist? Are you still a bigot? Are you exactly what Kamala Harris called you? I think in many ways you still are. In many ways you still are because all you do is you yell the president, you call him a liar, and you dare to call him a racist, you are a disaster. That's why they hide you in the basement and that's why you started interrupting the president of the United States, the same thing you did to Paul Ryan. If we had an honest press rather than a corrupt press -- HANNITY: Mark -- LEVIN: -- if we had people who really wanted to get to the bottom of each candidate, Joe Biden wouldn't have a chance. HANNITY: That's it. Mark Levin, the great one, thank you for being with us, Mark. By the way, the president of the United States is on our newsmaker line. Mr. President, thank you for being with us. I know you have been busy all night. Thank you for taking the time. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you. HANNITY: Let me pick up... TRUMP: And Mark is so right. Look, Mark is so right. You can't say it any better than that. I go through this every year every time everybody says something. And you look at their records, their records are horrible. It's fake news. You look at -- I watched John Roberts screaming at Kayleigh. And Kayleigh -- Kayleigh was so wonderful, the way she handled it. But I watched him screaming. And his wife, John's wife, was saying, what are you doing? Because, yesterday, I made a statement that was -- according to most, it was a perfect statement. But I have said it so many times even beyond that. And no matter what you say, it'll never -- they will just keep going, going, going. And, you know, Biden did the 1994 crime bill. That's the super predator bill. So, he did the super predator bill. And when you look at it -- but Mark Levin is right. He's 100 percent right. HANNITY: Mr. President, though, let me -- let me ask you. TRUMP: No matter what you say, it won't make any difference. And I have to say -- I have said it many times. And let me be clear again. I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don't know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing, but I condemn that. But he should condemn also Antifa. Antifa is a horrible group of people. They kill people. They -- what they do to people -- and they're causing insurrection. They're causing riots. He doesn't want to do that. But the press doesn't go after him. And that's a really bad group of people. But I condemn them. And if I can -- if I say it 100 -- if I say it 100 times, it won't be enough, because it's fake news. HANNITY: Mr. President, I played earlier -- Joe Biden is out there all day today saying you have never condemned white nationalists. You just did. You have never condemned segregationists. You just did. You have never condemned the KKK. You have. And you have never condemned David Duke. You are condemning all of them tonight, on record tonight, sir. Is that correct? TRUMP: Yes. But I have condemned them in the past. For years, I have condemned people, and I think almost everything that you mentioned. What hasn't been condemned is his crime bill, where he talks about super predators. HANNITY: Let me ask you this. TRUMP: And that was the worst thing -- that was the worst thing that ever happened to the black community, for the young men and women of the black community. That was sleepy Joe Biden. HANNITY: Mark Levin went through -- and we have done it on this program too -- an exhaustive examination of Joe Biden and his history on racial issues. He did refer to Robert Byrd, the former Klansman... TRUMP: That's right. HANNITY: ... as \"my friend and mentor.\" That's the man that filibustered the Civil Rights Act. That's the man against the Voting Rights Act. And Robert Byrd was the man that Joe Biden partnered with to stop busing and integration of schools, because -- I will use the words of Joe -- he didn't want his kids going to schools that were a racial jungle. Are you calling on Joe Biden to apologize to anybody tonight? Are you condemning him for his remarks? TRUMP: Well, he has to do it, because what he did was terrible. And he has to do it. But it's a different standard. It's total hypocrisy. It's a disgrace. But I think the people are wise to it, Sean. I really do. The people are wise to it. Every time you do something, every time you say it -- and Chris Wallace asked me the same -- almost the same question last time. And, you know, it's a -- it's a shame. It's a shame that they can get away with it. And -- but, when I saw John Roberts today going crazy, and then his wife said, well, wait a minute, he just gave a news conference, and what he said was very good. Now, I didn't see her exact statement, but I thought she said something very good. She actually criticized her husband. That was terrible. I mean, he went -- he went a little crazy. HANNITY: I didn't see the exchange today. TRUMP: He went a little bit crazy. HANNITY: Well, let me... TRUMP: Well, I saw it. I saw it. And Kayleigh is this incredible person. And she -- she was abused by John Roberts. That's a terrible thing. HANNITY: Let me... TRUMP: FOX is a much different -- FOX is a much different place than it used to be, Sean. HANNITY: Let me -- let me ask you. We have a lot of ground to cover, and very little time to do it. There's an election in 33 days. TRUMP: Right. HANNITY: I went through a lot of things. And I don't know. We always say the words, this is the land of the free and the home of the brave. And Mark is right. If you look at the debate with Paul Ryan years ago, Joe Biden interrupted a lot, fought a lot, was -- was -- but, from all my interviews with you, you don't apologize for fighting to take out the caliphate, or Soleimani, or al-Baghdadi, or the al Qaeda leader in Yemen. You don't seem to mind to fight to get the money for the wall or fight for lower taxes, or to go out and fight for energy independence, or fight for the justices you promised you would put on the Supreme Court. Some people say, well, maybe the president shouldn't have fought so hard in the debate. What -- how do you respond to them? TRUMP: Well, I have to do it, because I know a lot of people said, look, he was losing his -- his -- his -- if you look at what he did, he was probably or possibly losing that coherence that everybody talks about, because he's a mess. Let's face it, he's a mess. Now, I could have waited, but he was saying so many lies that I figured it was just better to bring it up as he's saying them, because it was just lie after lie after lie. And so, I would do it as he said it. I would criticize him. And I think it was effective. If you look at the polls, I mean, almost all the polls, the poll people, the polls say that I won. The Hispanics, they have me close to 70 percent to 28, because they're strong people, smart people. HANNITY: That was the Telemundo poll. There was a WGN poll that had you at 61 percent. TRUMP: Yes. HANNITY: By the way, I want to just... TRUMP: I mean, I would have -- I would have preferred letting him catch himself, because -- because he can't issue a full statement, practically. But, at the same time, on the assumption that he does, he is going on and on with lie after lie. So, I had to correct those lies as they came up, too many to go back and get. You didn't have enough -- we didn't have enough paper. Too many to go and get. HANNITY: And what... TRUMP: And I don't know. I think it was a very effective -- frankly, I'd like to leave the same format. I like the format. HANNITY: What if they change -- they're talking about the Debate Commission asking -- talking about changing the rules. There are already rules agreed to. What is your reaction if they try to do that? TRUMP: Well, this is the rules that were agreed to. But, you know, I think it would be very bad. You remember, with Hillary Clinton, they modulated my mic. And they actually apologized for it. But they -- they modulated my mic. So, when I looked at her, they had my mic turned off, or way down. And I said, what's going on over here? They actually issued an apology. So, we're dealing with very tricky people here. But I think you remember that very well. They modulated my mic. And they say I won all the debates, so I was in 16-17 debates. They say I won all the debates. I like this format but at the same time, you know, he's got to -- he's got to be truthful. And by the way, a number of people brought up today Sean that he was the one that interrupted me. He started off with three major interruptions long before I started doing it to him. HANNITY: OK. I want to point out tonight. I know the First Lady Melania Trump, the White House is pink tonight in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. And she wrote that as one nation we remember the precious lives lost. Pray to bring comfort and strength to those battling the disease. By the way my -- my mom, in life, had very advance stage cancer, breast cancer. TRUMP: Right. HANNITY: Double mastectomy. Chemotherapy, radiation, she survived but barely. So it is an important thing. One in seven women can get this. It's very scary. Let me ask you about Joe Biden will not answer the question about packing the court. TRUMP: Yes. HANNITY: Chuck Schumer said last night that everything is on the table. That means statehood for D.C., statehood for Puerto Rico, ending the legislative filibuster and some Democrats have even talked about moving for a Constitutional amendment to end the electoral college. Joe Biden says, that it's a trick, a Donald Trump trick to tell the American people if he'll stack the courts or -- or do any of these things. Your response. TRUMP: Well I went after him on that and I said are you going to stack the court? I also said are you going to say the words law and order. He wouldn't say them. He then said law and order was safety and justice or something. But I said to him that but we need law and order in our country. And the Democrat cities are falling to pieces with this whole -- with these people running them. But, stacking the court, they could have many justices. They want to put many -- because we've been beating them, and we have the nine justices and we have a great new one going on. But now what they want to do is they want to put many additional justices on the Supreme Court so that they can -- it's sort of like you're losing the game and you start cheating. But they want to put many -- they are. I mean, they're doing it with the ballots. They're doing it with the Supreme Court. And it's a very sad thing. But they are-- they are looking to stack the court and they are also going to add two or three new states. I heard Guam and two others that you mentioned as you know. That would give them six automatic Senate seats, automatic. No chance. It would be very unfair and 20 something Congressional seats. So that's what they want to do. So, if you -- if you give them what they want, and we really have a one party system. He can never catch up. So, they'll be talking about anywhere from four to six Senators, Republicans can't win those states although I've been better to Puerto Rico than any other president. I've given them a lot of help. But, if you take a look at what's happening. They're not good to Puerto Rico. But I've been good to Puerto Rico. I have a good relationship to Puerto Rico. But they're looking for statehood. A lot of Puerto Ricans don't want statehood. They're doing better the way it is now frankly. But they want to -- and you've been seeing this. This has been taking place. They want to put two or three states. So, they want to have -- they want to have 53. Right? 53. What's the flag going to look like? Right Sean? What's the flag going to look like? They want to have 53 or 52 depending on what they do. I guess they could probably do even more than that. We have islands all over the place. Why don't they go for the whole ballgame? So, it's a very, very sad thing for our country, very, very sad thing. And in all fairness to Mitch, he did not want to do the nuclear option and I disagreed because I said they're going to do it and it turned out they are. But he's a legitimate guy. He is not -- he wasn't going to do the nuclear option because he thought it was bad for our country. So, I understood that, and I didn't go wild, but I did say it would be good to do it because they're going to do it. So, it's a very sad thing. So you're going to have two or three more states added. You're going to have four or six Senators added, 100 percent Democrat. 100 percent. You're going to have maybe 20 Congressional candidates or districts added and it's really a horrible thing. It's going to be very unfair. You're going to end up having a one-party system in the United States. So, if people want to stop that, you got to vote against the Democrats. HANNITY: By the way, some news broke earlier this evening. Hope Hicks, who's worked for you a long time has tested positive for coronavirus. TRUMP: Yes. HANNITY: Obviously our prayers are with her and by the way everybody that is as you call taking-- gotten this invisible enemy. Do you have any update on her? And where are we with therapeutics? Where are we with the vaccine? Is... TRUMP: So, she did test positive. I just heard about this. She tested positive. She's a hard worker. A lot of masks. So, she wears masks a lot. But she tested positive. And I just went out with a test. I'll see what -- because we spend a lot of time. And the first lady just went out with a test also. So, whether we quarantine, or whether we have it, I don't know. You know, it's very hard. When you're with soldiers, when you're with airmen, when you're with Marines, and I'm with -- and the police officers. I'm with them so much. And when they come over here, it's very hard to say, stay back, stay back. It's a tough kind of a situation. It's a terrible thing. So, I just went for a test, and we will see what happens. I mean, who knows? But you know her very well. She's fantastic. And she's done a great job. But it's very, very hard when you are with people from the military or for law enforcement. And they come over to you, and they want to hug you, and they want to kiss you, because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close, and things happen. I was surprised to hear with Hope. But she's a very warm person with them. And she -- she knows there's a risk. But she's young. And I just -- I just went out for a test. They just do it. It will come back later, I guess, and the first lady also, because we spend a lot of time with Hope and others. So, we will see what happens. But... HANNITY: Where are we with therapeutics and with a vaccine, in your view? TRUMP: ... you have to -- you have to treat our -- you have to treat our people great. You can't just say, stay away, stay away. They come up to you. They're such love with what we have done for them. And there's such love. And you have to treat our people great. I think the vaccines are coming quickly. I do think it's somewhat political. They'd like to do it. Even the drug companies, they have dealt with these people a long time. I think they'd like to do it after the election, even if it's a couple of days. But the fact is, the vaccines are coming out. The therapeutics are coming out. And they're coming out really good, Regeneron and others. Other companies are great, Eli Lilly. So, we will have to see. The survival rate is so much better now than it was. You have seen those numbers, I guess, 95 percent, or something like that, better. So, we will have to see. HANNITY: Yes. TRUMP: I mean, I'll -- I'll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning. But I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady. And she's tremendous. I was a little surprised. But she's -- she's a very warm person. She has a hard time when soldiers and law enforcement come up -- comes up to her. You know, she wants to treat them great, not say, stay away, I can't get near you. It's a very, very tough disease. HANNITY: Let me -- let me ask you this question. You have talked a lot about the issue of voter fraud. TRUMP: Yes. HANNITY: And, by the way, this was just breaking tonight as we're coming on the air, that the Trump campaign is suing Philadelphia over mail-in voting offices. TRUMP: Sure. HANNITY: We had 100,000 ballots in trouble. The Heritage Foundation identified 1,285 cases of recent voter fraud, including nearly 1,000 convictions on the issues. TRUMP: Really? HANNITY: We saw the Trump ballots, military ballots, in a wastepaper basket in Pennsylvania. We had people being mailed absentee ballots. And we had voter -- we had a criminal conviction in New Jersey, attempted to bribe voters with mail-in ballots. Project Veritas came out with a tape. There was a case in Florida. TRUMP: That's right. HANNITY: There's been cases all over Colorado, Florida, Texas. TRUMP: That's right, a scam. And everyone knows it, Sean. It's a scam. And everyone knows it. HANNITY: How do we -- how do we have voter integrity? And this idea that Hillary Clinton -- talked about you accepting the results of the election. Hillary said under no circumstances should Joe Biden ever concede the election. Joe said the other night he would, under the right circumstances. Do you really foresee a problem? And these last-minute changes that are being made, I mean, to me, it's incalculable how that then impacts the election. What are your thoughts? TRUMP: Well, in New York, they lost -- 100,000 ballots were sent out wrong. The envelopes were wrong. The names were wrong. Everything was wrong. So, they said, oh, that's OK. We will send out a new 100,000. OK, let's assume they get it right. What happens to the 100,000 that they sent out? They're going to be sent back by somebody. And it's going to be a fraud. This is a terrible thing that's happening to our country. And, you know, the only one that knows it better than you and I and other people is the Democrats. They know it. They know it. They're smart. But I'll tell you, the big hope is that we have great federal judges. And we have a lot of cases in front of these federal judges. And I think they're really talented, very smart. And I think that we're going to do very well, because no judge -- how about this? The election ends on November 3, but they're giving, like, certain states the right to go another week. So, that means we're not going to know -- because, you know, they're big states. That means we're not going to know the election for another week. And then if there's fraud, then there's going to be a lot of, you know -- and there will be. Just take a look at New York. Take a look at the ones -- the ballots that were thrown into a garbage can and they all had the Trump name on it. They were military ballots that were thrown into the garbage can. The ones that were on a tray, and they were thrown into a creek or a river. It's a terrible thing. And if you look at Carolyn Maloney, what they did to that guy that ran against her, it's a disgrace. That's in New York. And that's only for a congressional race. They have no idea where the votes are, where the ballots are. This is going to be all over. This is in Virginia. This is in New Jersey. It's a very, very sad thing. And, hopefully, we can win by a lot, because I have no doubt that they're going to be doing a number. I have no doubt about it. And the press knows that, too. You know, they act so -- so sacrosanct. They act, oh, it's so terrible. He's talking about our democracy. They know what's going on. It's really a shame. If the other side did this, you would see everybody would be arrested and put in jail. You have to see what's going on. But the good news is, we just got a very good decision in Rhode Island. Great decision. We have some great decisions coming down. You have to have the votes in by November 3rd. You have to have it signed. You have to have it certified. You have to guarantee the certification. I mean, in Nevada, Sean, they don't want to have any certification of a signature. Just do a signature and they don't want to have certification. HANNITY: Let me -- TRUMP: I think that you don't even -- I think you don't even have to sign it. And the governor is a very political person. It's a -- it's a ridiculous thing. And we're going to win Nevada on a fair basis, but it's very hard when they send millions of ballots out and then they cheat. HANNITY: Let me ask you, we learned this week -- and this is something -- we broke a lot of news in the last three and a half years, not really gotten a lot of credit for, it turns out we were right all along -- TRUMP: That's true. HANNITY: -- that the Obama administration knew in 2016 that -- they knew Hillary was attempting to tie you to Russia to get away and distract from her subpoenaed emails. We also learned that now, James Comey, along with Rod Rosenstein, along with Sally Yates, knowing what they know now, never would have signed the FISA applications that denied constitutional rights to Carter Page to spy on your campaign, your transition team and your presidency. Comey had amnesia on the rest of it. But we also learned that Christopher Steele's source -- and that was the bulk of data Andrew McCabe said, no, no -- no -- no Christopher Steele files, that Hillary dossier, there would be no -- no FISA warrants. We now know that all of it was from a guy that our own FBI knew to be a Russian operative for 10 years. TRUMP: Right. HANNITY: We don't have a lot of time. Your reaction? All this new news. TRUMP: Well, it's just -- it's a scam. They spied on our campaign, they got caught. The only sad thing is nothing is happening with them. And they're -- they're a bunch of crooks. They spied on our campaign, they got caught. They tried to take -- they tried to do a coup, and they got caught. Now we got to see what's going to happen. It's time to move. This is ridiculous, OK? This is ridiculous. It's so sad. We caught them spying on our campaign, it never happened before. Spied before and after. And it never happened before. And I watched Comey, he couldn't remember anything, but he's writing all these books. They're guilty as hell. They should all be in jail, OK? You know it and I know it. They should all be in jail. And it's disgraceful. It's a disgrace for to our country if they don't go to jail. Hillary Clinton got caught, Comey got caught, they all got caught. And Biden, by the way, mentioned the Logan Act. That was a big part of it. And Obama, too. It's a disgrace what's happened. A disgrace. And that they should do something about it. If they can't just let this go on ad infinitum. They should do something about it. HANNITY: Let me ask you very quickly here. This election is in 33 days. TRUMP: Right. HANNITY: What is -- in the 45 seconds we have left, you've gone through things you want to do -- the economy, law and order, safety security, and a vaccine. Are those your three top things that you want to accomplish? TRUMP: Well, it is. I mean, it is. But we've already rebuilt the military, $2.5 trillion. It's the strongest military in the world by far. We have the weapons the likes of which nobody even comes close to. And so, we've done that. We've cut taxes at a record level. We've cut -- if you look at regulations, we've cut more regulations than any president in history by far. HANNITY: Where will the economy be in -- by the end of this year in your view? We have 20 seconds. TRUMP: Well, I think better than that. I think you're going to see some great numbers just two days before because you're going to have the third quarter come out just before the election. I think you're going to be up anywhere from 22 to 35 percent in GDP. And if that's the case, that's bigger than any economic rebound in history. So, I think that will be good, let's see what happens. But those numbers are coming out sometime prior to -- HANNITY: All right. TRUMP: -- sometime prior to November 3rd, which is the election. HANNITY: All right. Mr. President, 33 days, the American people are the ultimate jury, thank you for being with us. TRUMP: Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you. HANNITY: All right. We're out of time. Let not your heart be troubled -- Laura Ingraham, I'm only seven seconds late. I apologize. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Federal workers forced to attend seminars on 'white privilege' and 'microaggressions'; Christopher Rufo, research fellow at the Discovery Institute and contributing editor at City Journal, joins Tucker Carlson with insight. The Trump administration is working to halt training exercises designed to educate federal employees about white privilege and other issues, a source told Fox News. The revelation came after Discovery Institute researcher\u00a0Christopher Rufo\u00a0told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that \"critical race theory\" had become the default ideology of the federal government. He pointed to several of his own findings, including that Sandia National Laboratories -- which designs nuclear weapons -- held a mandatory retreat titled, \"White Men\u2019s Caucus on Eliminating Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia in Organizations.\u201d In response to Rufo's claims, a senior administration official told Fox News that the administration was doing everything they could to stop those types of trainings for federal employees. Rufo specifically called on President Trump to sign an executive order banning critical race theory-type trainings from the federal government. CHRIS RUFO CALLS ON TRUMP TO END CRITICAL RACE THEORY 'CULT INDOCTRINATION' IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT It's unclear when the\u00a0administration's efforts to end these trainings started, but as Rufo noted, many of these events, as well as other controversial changes, took place during Trump's tenure in the White House. More recently, NASA came under fire for announcing it would no longer use the terms \"Eskimo Nebula\" and \"Siamese Twins Galaxy\" as part of ongoing efforts to stamp out\u00a0\"systemic discrimination\u00a0and inequality.\" And in July, the federally-created\u00a0National Museum for African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) faced a wave of backlash for publishing a graphic that linked\u00a0things like the\u00a0nuclear family\u00a0and \"decision-making\"\u00a0to whiteness. The museum later removed the graphic. Some of those same concepts came up during the \"White Men's Caucus\" reportedly held for Sandia's white male executives in 2019. IOWA STATE PROFESSOR THREATENS TO DISMISS STUDENTS WHO OPPOSE ABORTION, BLACK LIVES MATTER Reportedly hosted by a company called \"White Men As Full Diversity Partners,\" the training entailed\u00a0identifying assumptions about\u00a0white culture or privilege. A\u00a0training document obtained by Rufo listed a series of \"examples of white male culture.\" Those included \"golf,\" \"quick decisions,\" \"self-confident,\" \"risk taking,\" \"brave,\" and other attributes that the document notes were \"generated by participants.\"\u00a0Sandia National Laboratories did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. One of the caucus packets also included a large sheet of paper with the title \"white men\" at the top. Listed below were a series of words in either red, green, or black ink -- apparently indicating negative or positive connotations. Terms like \"mass killing\" and \"engineers\" were in red while \"country music,\" \"MAGA hat,\" and \"patriotic\" appeared in green marker. \"Founding fathers,\" \"protestant work ethic,\" and \"power\" appeared in black marker. It's unclear whether these programs will end but Rufo's reporting has indicated that leadership, at least at Sandia, support this type of training. In August, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a letter to the Department of Energy demanding that it provide an explanation for the caucus hosted for Sandia executives. Hawley announced at the end of last month that Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette initiated a department-wide investigation of the issue. AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM REMOVES CONTROVERSIAL CHART LINKING 'WHITENESS' TO SELF-RELIANCE, DECISION-MAKING A DOE spokeswoman reportedly said: \"The Department of Energy (DOE) leadership did not have knowledge of or authorize the use of taxpayer dollars for the reported social workshops at the Sandia National Laboratories, or elsewhere. The Secretary has directed the NNSA [National Nuclear Security Administration], as well as DOE leadership, to initiate an expedited enterprise wide review of trainings that take place at all 17 labs, plants and sites to ensure equal treatment for all employees and contractors. In addition, he has asked DOE's Inspector General to initiate its own independent investigation.\" Rufo claims to have found instances of similar trainings across a long list of federal agencies, including the FBI. That particular event, titled \"Difficult Conversations about Race in Troubling Times,\" coincided with a national uproar over George Floyd's death and racial injustice more generally in the U.S. Documents dated June 24, 2020, and\u00a0obtained by Rufo, defended this type of training as a way to dismantle systemic racism. \"When people begin to become more aware of some of the problematic and ingrained behaviors from the past, especially White people, they begin to look to what to begin doing to support the dismantling of systemic racism,\" one of the documents read. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An information packet reportedly obtained from that event also\u00a0declares: \"It is imperative at this time that people who are Whiteinvest in race-based growth and development on topics such as systemic racism, civil rights history, unconscious bias, inclusion, and contemporary ideology such as anti-racism, intersectionality, White privilege, and White fragility.\" The packet also directs employees to read \"How to be an Anti-Racist,\" by Dr. Ibram Kendi, whose antiracist research center recently received a $10 million donation from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Kendi has argued that\u00a0\"there is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy.\" He previously proposed tasking the federal government with monitoring public officials' speech, disciplining them, and \"pre-clearing\" all local, state, and federal policies based on how they impact racial equity.",

            "article_content": "Critical race theory is the latest attempt by the most privileged people in our society to displace the blame for their mismanagement of the country onto the people below them. CNN President Jeff Zucker should resign from his job if he believes in\u00a0critical race theory and its arguments about white privilege, Fox News host Tucker Carlson\u00a0argued Tuesday. The \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" host devoted the opening segment of his program to the reaction that followed President Trump's announcement last week halting critical race theory training for federal employees. \"White privilege is\u00a0very real, they're\u00a0telling you.\u00a0It is time for a\u00a0'reckoning\u00a0on race\u00a0relations,'\" Carlson said during his monologue.\u00a0\"You hear that all the time, but\u00a0at some point, you've got to\u00a0wonder why any of these people,\u00a0the most privileged people in\u00a0America, still have their jobs. If they meant what they were\u00a0saying, why haven't they resigned and given their highly-paid gigs to oppressed people? TRUMP ENDS 'CRITICAL RACE THEORY' TRAINING FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, CALLS IT A 'SICKNESS' \"That's a very\u00a0good question,\" the host continued.\u00a0\"It's the core question and someone ought to ask Jeff\u00a0Zucker about that some time.\u00a0Zucker is the\u00a0head of CNN, he's a graduate of Harvard University. He's been in television his\u00a0entire adult life. Jeff Zucker is the embodiment of\u00a0privilege if there ever was one.\u00a0According to critical race theory, the theory that he espouses and defends, Jeff Zucker got his job precisely\u00a0because of systemic racism.\u00a0So why does he still have it?\u00a0How can he bear to hold that\u00a0job? \"Needless to say, Jeff Zucker has no plans to\u00a0resign. Instead, according to sources, he ordered his minions to attack this show for the crime of criticizing critical theory,\" Carlson went on.\u00a0\"And, over the weekend, the most\u00a0dutiful ones\u00a0did just that.\" Carlson then played a clip of CNN media analyst Brian Stelter discussing Trump's order on his Sunday show \"Reliable Sources\" and noting that Carlson \"gets results.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"They're children. They do\u00a0what they're told,\" Carlson responded.\u00a0\"This morning, we are told, Jeff Zucker instructed\u00a0the entire\u00a0CNN news operation to keep\u00a0up the attacks on this show, which is fine.\u00a0We can't control it.\u00a0Good luck with that, go crazy. But as long as Jeff Zucker holds onto his own job, which, according to\u00a0their own talking points, is the\u00a0ill-gotten fruit of White privilege and systemic racism, we will know for certain they do\u00a0not mean\u00a0a single word of what\u00a0they are saying because of\u00a0course they don't mean it. \"They never did,\" he added.\u00a0\"Meanwhile, we are learning how deeply\u00a0this poison has penetrated into the\u00a0federal agencies.\"",

A video circulating online shows three women being chastised for using their \"white privilege\"\u00a0while removing graffiti in support of Black Lives Matter from a federal building in Washington, D.C. The women, all white, were attempting to scrub off spray paint that read\u00a0\"BLM\" on\u00a0the\u00a0Lafayette Building, located near the White House, when they were approached by someone driving\u00a0a vehicle, according to the video that was tweeted Wednesday. Like other cities, Washington, D.C., has seen daily demonstrations over the death of George Floyd. Some protests have devolved into riots where looters have ransacked businesses, set fires and damaged property. The Lafayette Building is the home of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and some offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the women are attempting to scrub off the spray paint, the driver asked why they were removing the graffiti. \u201cThis is a federal building and we care about our country and our city,\" one woman responds. \u201cSo you don\u2019t care about black lives, then,\" the person filming says. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all what we\u2019re saying \u2026 we certainly do care about black lives,\u201d one woman responds. \u201cWe don\u2019t disagree with the message ma'am, it\u2019s just on the building, so we\u2019re trying to clean it.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cNot a great way to use your white privilege ladies,\u201d the driver says before the filming stops. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Several buildings and iconic memorials in the city have been defaced\u00a0over several nights of protests, including the World War II Memorial and Lincoln Memorial.",

I'm Laura\u00a0Ingraham, this is\u00a0THE\u00a0INGRAHAM\u00a0ANGLE\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0White House, as Sean said. Coming up, my\u00a0angle\u00a0will explain\u00a0how Joe's supposed COVID strategy, is that what we're calling it? Will keep\u00a0us stuck for years in this absurd and destructive pandemic paranoia. Plus,\u00a0Raymond Arroyo brings us weekend at Biden's in tonight, Seen and Unseen.\u00a0What does old Joe forget this time? We'll reveal.\u00a0And I went to Ohio State University where students told me,\u00a0they're\u00a0actually scared to reveal\u00a0their political views on campus. Dinesh D'Souza\u00a0knows a lot about this. He's been all over\u00a0the\u00a0country on college campuses\u00a0talking politics. What does this type of new radicalism mean for our daily\u00a0lives?\u00a0But first, as Joe Biden continues to phone it in and let\u00a0the\u00a0press do his\u00a0campaigning for him, President Trump continues to demonstrate that\u00a0regardless of what\u00a0the\u00a0polls say and you see\u00a0them all over\u00a0the\u00a0place, he\u00a0remains an unwavering political force of nature. Just over\u00a0the\u00a0past 72\u00a0hours, he has held massive rallies in Ohio,\u00a0then to Wisconsin.\u00a0Then he went\u00a0live free or die in New Hampshire, and\u00a0then it was up to Maine. And today,\u00a0three more stops in Pennsylvania.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF\u00a0THE\u00a0UNITED STATES: Sleepy Joe Biden said a\u00a0little while ago, he was in a lid. You know what a lid is, it is a garbage\u00a0can.\u00a0They put\u00a0the\u00a0lid on it.\u00a0They put\u00a0the\u00a0lid. And he saw we had two of\u00a0these today.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: But all of\u00a0the\u00a0Trump rallies, perhaps\u00a0the\u00a0ones who didn't even\u00a0attend, I think\u00a0they actually ended up saying\u00a0the\u00a0most to us, like in\u00a0the\u00a0liberal bastion of Beverly Hills.\u00a0(VIDEO PLAYING)INGRAHAM: I wanted to be\u00a0there. OK, I think I've got that video, different\u00a0forms of it, from five different people in in LA. It was awesome. And\u00a0then\u00a0after all of that, tonight here at\u00a0the\u00a0White House, President Trump\u00a0returned to swear in his third nominee as associate justice of\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court, a woman of outstanding intellect and character.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0The\u00a0American people put\u00a0their trust in you and\u00a0their faith in you as\u00a0you take up\u00a0the\u00a0task of defending our laws, our Constitution, and this\u00a0country that we all love. We ask God to give you wisdom and courage. I know\u00a0you will make us all very, very proud.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: With Justice Barrett's confirmation,\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats are seething\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0president and\u00a0the\u00a0Republican Senate did what\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution\u00a0allows. Oh, but\u00a0they're hoping for payback next Tuesday. But\u00a0there I see\u00a0the\u00a0same time\u00a0they're still freaking out. Check this out from\u00a0the\u00a0LA Times,\u00a0Biden operatives are obsessing over\u00a0the\u00a0ways that everything could go\u00a0sideways in this unpredictable election. Everybody is anxious, said Paul\u00a0Begala, longtime adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\u00a0We have permanent traumatic stress disorder. We'll never get over what\u00a0happened in 2016. Well, that's why Democrats and\u00a0their media lackeys are\u00a0going to great lengths to keep you all in\u00a0the\u00a0dark about Joe's real plans\u00a0for America.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0TRUMP: Not pack\u00a0the\u00a0court. He's got to agree to give us a list of five or\u00a010 or 20 or 30 or 40, got to have people to pick from. And if you don't\u00a0have that list, you can't vote for him. You know, it's more than just\u00a0the\u00a0pack in\u00a0the\u00a0court. He's got to say, who's he going to put on? Because we\u00a0can't have radical Left justices that are going to destroy our nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Now, to be fair, maybe Biden's not telling us because he's\u00a0forgotten his own plans. Watch Biden's staff quickly swoop in to shuffle\u00a0them along during a quickie escape\u00a0the\u00a0basement trip to Pennsylvania.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Here's\u00a0the\u00a0deal, one of\u00a0the\u00a0things that\u00a0is important is that - keep in mind although\u00a0they're going to vote on\u00a0Barrett, I think today.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: That was terrifying.

And on fracking, AOC either knows Joe is\u00a0lying about not wanting to ban it or she's making\u00a0the\u00a0ultimate devil's\u00a0bargain.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You introduced a bill earlier this year that would ban\u00a0all fracking nationwide within\u00a0the\u00a0next five years. Vice President Biden's\u00a0position on\u00a0the\u00a0issue of fracking has been confusing. It sounds like now\u00a0he's on\u00a0the\u00a0other side of this issue from you. Does it bother you?REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): It will be a privilege to lobby him.\u00a0Should we win\u00a0the\u00a0White House? But we need to focus on winning\u00a0the\u00a0White\u00a0House first.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: But as usual,\u00a0the\u00a0voters are pretty good at seeing through\u00a0the\u00a0hogwash.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Voters we spoke to in western Pennsylvania are still\u00a0pretty confused on\u00a0the\u00a0former vice president's position.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden in\u00a0the\u00a0past and through\u00a0the\u00a0campaign has kind of\u00a0gone back and forth on what he wants to do.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Almost like a domino effect. And it could just be\u00a0disastrous in my eyes. If first a pandemic and\u00a0then tracking is ban.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0The\u00a0majority of voters we spoke to say\u00a0they will be\u00a0supporting President Trump this time around because\u00a0they do feel like his\u00a0message is a little clearer and will be good for\u00a0their livelihoods and\u00a0their future.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Now, this is all going to come down to one question. Are\u00a0Americans more fearful of losing\u00a0their livelihoods and freedom than\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0the\u00a0virus? Now, if\u00a0the\u00a0former is true, enough, will choose to bet on\u00a0four more years with Trump, who fights for\u00a0the\u00a0American worker like\u00a0there's\u00a0no tomorrow.\u00a0Joining me now is Missouri Senator Josh Hawley of\u00a0the\u00a0Judiciary Committee,\u00a0which of course, took\u00a0the\u00a0lead on securing Justice Barrett's confirmation.\u00a0Senator Hawley great to see you tonight. All that hard work, I thought\u00a0about this. I was at\u00a0the\u00a0South Lawn watching Amy Coney Barrett be sworn in,\u00a0and I thought all of her hard work paid off for her personally, but it\u00a0actually paid off for\u00a0the\u00a0country and getting a just woman of incredible\u00a0intellect and character on\u00a0the\u00a0court.SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Yes, we're getting -\u00a0the\u00a0country is getting a\u00a0stellar, stellar justice. And I have to say, Laura, I mean, for religious\u00a0conservatives who have fought for so long and who have gone and voted for\u00a0so long for Republicans on\u00a0the\u00a0basis that\u00a0they would appoint pro-constitution, pro-religious liberty, pro-life justices to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court, tonight's a big moment. This is\u00a0the\u00a0most openly pro-life justice of\u00a0my lifetime,\u00a0the\u00a0most openly pro-life judicial nominee to\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0of my lifetime.\u00a0And you know what, she didn't back away from that in her confirmation\u00a0hearings. She didn't back away from any of her views, any of\u00a0the\u00a0things she\u00a0had written. She stood her ground. She stood down\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats. Tonight,\u00a0she's a new justice.\u00a0INGRAHAM: But she spoke tonight from\u00a0the\u00a0South Lawn, also about\u00a0the\u00a0role of\u00a0the\u00a0judiciary. Senator Hawley. I mean,\u00a0the\u00a0fact that she's a pro-life\u00a0justice doesn't really for her and given what she said tonight, she said\u00a0there are two different roles.\u00a0The\u00a0legislator who has\u00a0the\u00a0policy preference\u00a0might be against Roe versus Wade and abortion. But as\u00a0the\u00a0jurist, you must\u00a0be faithful to\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution. She gave everyone a constitutional law\u00a0primer tonight in her very short remarks.HAWLEY: Yes, exactly. She's someone who understands that judicial\u00a0imperialism is not\u00a0the\u00a0role that\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution gives to judges on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court or any of our courts, and that, in fact,\u00a0the\u00a0role of\u00a0the\u00a0judge is not to impose policy views, but is to follow\u00a0the\u00a0law faithfully.\u00a0And that means Laura, we're sticking to\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution's text, sticking\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0text of\u00a0the\u00a0laws. And I have to tell you, I think that Judge\u00a0Barrett, now Justice Barrett is going to do exactly that.\u00a0But it is important that in this day and age, you can be openly pro-life.\u00a0She was openly critical of Roe when she was a professor, when she was in\u00a0private practice. And you know what? That's not a disqualification. It's OK\u00a0to be a pro-life Catholic and be on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court of\u00a0the\u00a0United States.\u00a0It's OK to be openly critical of Roe. You can do that and be on\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court of\u00a0the\u00a0United States. This confirmation is vital for setting that\u00a0principle down. She's going to be a great justice.INGRAHAM: Yes, I could not be more thrilled. And by contrast, I don't know\u00a0if you caught 60 Minutes last night, Senator Hawley, but Joe Biden laid out\u00a0this plan for\u00a0the\u00a0court.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BIDEN: If elected, what I will do is put together a national commission, a\u00a0bipartisan commission of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats,\u00a0Republicans, liberal, conservative. And I will ask\u00a0them to, over 180 days,\u00a0come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform\u00a0the\u00a0court system.\u00a0It's not about court packing.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: 180 days and a bipartisan commission. What's going on here,\u00a0Senator Hawley?\u00a0HAWLEY: Yes, that's a total joke. I mean, listen, he wants to pack\u00a0the\u00a0court,\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats,\u00a0the\u00a0radical left, who's taking over\u00a0their party,\u00a0they're desperate to pack\u00a0the\u00a0court. I mean, this has been\u00a0their whole\u00a0mantra here now for a long time. I mean,\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats were threatening\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court months ago by saying we're going to restructure you. That's\u00a0their new word.\u00a0They want to pack\u00a0the\u00a0court.\u00a0They want to pack\u00a0the\u00a0Senate.\u00a0They want to rig American democracy and basically overturn\u00a0the\u00a0results of\u00a0the\u00a0last two elections. That's\u00a0their agenda.\u00a0He's, of course, going to give in to it. He just doesn't have\u00a0the\u00a0guts to\u00a0say it. I wish he'd just own it. You know, I mean, have some guts, say yes,\u00a0I want to change\u00a0the\u00a0court and\u00a0then we can have a debate about it. But\u00a0let's make no mistake, Laura,\u00a0their goal here,\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats agenda, pack\u00a0the\u00a0court, pack\u00a0the\u00a0Senate, rig our democracy just like\u00a0they rigged our\u00a0economy under Obama. Biden shipped all of our jobs overseas. Now\u00a0they want\u00a0to rig democracy. And that's why we've got to stop\u00a0them.INGRAHAM: Well, when you see how incredibly nasty things have gotten in\u00a0this presidential election year where\u00a0the\u00a0Left is blaming\u00a0the\u00a0president for\u00a0a virus that originated in China as\u00a0the\u00a0Left is now cozying up to business\u00a0interests that want to send jobs over to China, Senator Hawley, I thought\u00a0there used to be pro-worker. What happened to that?HAWLEY: Yes, exactly.\u00a0They don't make much pretense of that anymore, do\u00a0they? Now, this is a party that now is owned by\u00a0these multinational\u00a0corporations, Wall Street, Silicon Valley. That's where\u00a0their big donors\u00a0are.\u00a0They give all\u00a0the\u00a0money to\u00a0the\u00a0Democrats and what\u00a0they want is a\u00a0return to liberal globalism.\u00a0They're going to go right back to\u00a0the\u00a0Obama-Biden years, where\u00a0they've shipped all those jobs overseas, where workers'\u00a0wages were flat or declining. That's what\u00a0they want to go back to.\u00a0And Biden, he's an apologist for China. He also said in that interview that\u00a0he thought that Russia was our biggest threat. He can barely bring himself\u00a0to name China as a competitor. I mean, this guy is totally out of touch\u00a0with reality, totally in\u00a0the\u00a0pocket of\u00a0the\u00a0big corporations. That's bad\u00a0news for working Americans.INGRAHAM: Social media is a huge force in this election, especially this\u00a0election, with all sorts of warnings and context and all sorts of little\u00a0messages you see on Twitter and other platforms. What about\u00a0the\u00a0CEOs of\u00a0the\u00a0big social media companies?\u00a0They're not going to testify before\u00a0the\u00a0election.\u00a0They are, I guess, set to testify November 17th. How does that\u00a0move\u00a0the\u00a0ball down\u00a0the\u00a0field post-election?HAWLEY: Well, it doesn't move it in\u00a0the\u00a0way it should. I mean, I've\u00a0absolutely of\u00a0the\u00a0view that\u00a0they should have been subpoenaed and\u00a0they have\u00a0been, but\u00a0they should have been subpoenaed before\u00a0the\u00a0election, which is\u00a0what I'd cast my vote for. So, I think we should be hearing from\u00a0them. I\u00a0think it's a mistake that we're not hearing from\u00a0them before\u00a0the\u00a0election.INGRAHAM: But who is behind that, Senator. Who is behind putting that off,\u00a0sorry to interrupt, but who is behind putting that off?\u00a0HAWLEY:\u00a0The\u00a0Judiciary Committee voted to authorize\u00a0the\u00a0chairman, Senator\u00a0Graham, to issue\u00a0the\u00a0subpoenas, and it's up to\u00a0the\u00a0chairman of\u00a0the\u00a0committee staff to decide when\u00a0the\u00a0subpoenas will issue. So, I think if I\u00a0believe, Laura, that actually now\u00a0these CEOs have agreed to come in\u00a0voluntarily. So, I think\u00a0the\u00a0subpoenas actually didn't even go out. So\u00a0maybe that was part of\u00a0the\u00a0deal that, well, we've got to come in later and\u00a0therefore, you know, that way, off to subpoenas, I don't know.\u00a0But I think\u00a0they should be in before\u00a0the\u00a0election. I think it is absolutely\u00a0vital that we tell\u00a0them you cannot get by with this. And Laura, we need to\u00a0change\u00a0the\u00a0law. We need to change\u00a0the\u00a0law to quit giving\u00a0the\u00a0special\u00a0sweetheart deals to Twitter and Facebook and Google. We have got to hold\u00a0them accountable and to make sure that this doesn't happen again.INGRAHAM: All right, Senator, thank you so much tonight. Great to see you,\u00a0as always. And\u00a0the\u00a0media's reaction to Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation was\u00a0exactly what you'd expect.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Judge Barrett will be sworn in tonight at\u00a0the\u00a0White House. And yes, you heard that right.\u00a0The\u00a0White House site of her\u00a0nomination slash super spreader event.ELIE MYSTAL,\u00a0THE\u00a0NATION CORRESPONDENT: What we have right now is Mitch\u00a0McConnell setting\u00a0the\u00a0house on fire.CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: I will never, ever in\u00a0the\u00a0rest of my life read an\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett decision from\u00a0the\u00a0court without seeing\u00a0the\u00a0charts,\u00a0without seeing\u00a0the\u00a0daily fatalities.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Is that a parody, is that even real? Joining me now is Mollie\u00a0Hemingway, Senior Editor at\u00a0the\u00a0Federalist, Fox News Contributor. Mollie,\u00a0I'm sorry, I needed a good laugh tonight. That was ridiculous. But\u00a0they\u00a0have to paint her in\u00a0the\u00a0worst possible light now trying to connect her to\u00a0COVID. What?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR,\u00a0THE\u00a0FEDERALIST: Well, it is true that\u00a0the\u00a0media have really tried to have something stick with Amy Coney Barrett and\u00a0they have failed to do so, but\u00a0they have done all sorts of crazy coverage\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0last few weeks.\u00a0They tried to tarnish her for her religious views.\u00a0They went after her children in multiple different ways, trying to tie her\u00a0to a global pandemic that has hit\u00a0the\u00a0entire world.\u00a0And what I think is really interesting about it is as much as\u00a0the\u00a0media\u00a0tried to do a repeat of what\u00a0they did to Brett Kavanaugh, nobody seemed to\u00a0bite on it this time. And I think part of that is a reflection of people\u00a0having learned a lesson by what\u00a0they saw\u00a0the\u00a0media put Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0through and\u00a0they were not about to put up with it again. So, each time\u00a0these hit stories came out or\u00a0these crazy attacks, people just responded by\u00a0not taking\u00a0the\u00a0bait.INGRAHAM: And Senator Blumenthal, from my old home state of Connecticut,\u00a0Mollie, is out\u00a0there issuing threats now.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Our Republican colleagues are shattering\u00a0the\u00a0norms and breaking\u00a0the\u00a0rules and breaking\u00a0their word. And\u00a0there will be\u00a0consequences.\u00a0There inevitably are consequences when one person breaks her\u00a0or his word.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: I think he had a Joe Biden moment\u00a0there. I'm not sure where he\u00a0was going with that. What rules did\u00a0the\u00a0Republicans break,\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution? I'm not getting that.HEMINGWAY: Not sure where he's going with that. But this was - Mitch\u00a0McConnell gave a lengthy address right before\u00a0the\u00a0vote to confirm Amy Coney\u00a0Barrett, where he went through how Democrats seem to think that\u00a0there is no\u00a0legitimate way for\u00a0them to lose. So, if\u00a0they lose an election,\u00a0they say\u00a0it's not legitimate. If\u00a0there are results from those elections, such as\u00a0the\u00a0confirmation of Supreme Court justices,\u00a0they say those aren't legitimate.\u00a0Now\u00a0they're saying Amy Coney Barrett is not legitimate, but\u00a0they said\u00a0the\u00a0exact same thing about Brett Kavanaugh, and\u00a0they said\u00a0the\u00a0exact same thing\u00a0about Neil Gorsuch.\u00a0And Mitch McConnell pointed out that when it comes to norm breaking,\u00a0there\u00a0has been quite a history of norm breaking, unfortunately, by Democrats in\u00a0the\u00a0Senate, including as recently as last year or earlier this year. Chuck\u00a0Schumer making a threat against Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, sitting\u00a0members of\u00a0the\u00a0Supreme Court. He threatened\u00a0them while on\u00a0the\u00a0steps. He was\u00a0rebuked strongly, even by liberals for it, where you have senators saying\u00a0that if you don't vote\u00a0the\u00a0right way on a certain decision in\u00a0the\u00a0way that\u00a0we want you to rule, we will enact retribution, we will pack\u00a0the\u00a0court or\u00a0we will do other things to punish you.\u00a0And that really is norm breaking. And that really is different than what we\u00a0have seen in this country for a long period of time. And Mitch McConnell\u00a0called\u00a0them out on it.INGRAHAM: Mollie, really quick, Vladimir Putin apparently comes out and\u00a0says that\u00a0they don't - he doesn't see anything wrong with what Hunter Biden\u00a0did or and so now that kind of shatters\u00a0the\u00a0Russian collusion. Trump's a\u00a0puppet of Putin narrative, but\u00a0the\u00a0media just kind of let that go. Right?\u00a0It's just - that happened today.\u00a0HEMINGWAY: We have an eyewitness to Joe Biden talking about business with\u00a0Hunter Biden, talking about Hunter Biden's business. He has evidence in\u00a0support of\u00a0the\u00a0claim. It matches with contemporaneous evidence about where\u00a0Joe Biden was on a particular date back in 2017, and\u00a0the\u00a0media are\u00a0pretending like\u00a0there's no need to cover this, even though Joe Biden is\u00a0caught here in a lie about whether he ever discussed foreign business of\u00a0Hunter Biden.\u00a0INGRAHAM: Again, shoe on\u00a0the\u00a0other foot.\u00a0There already be launching\u00a0the\u00a0inquiries. Mollie, thank you so much. And coming up, my\u00a0angle\u00a0exposes\u00a0the\u00a0lie behind all of Biden's plans to fight COVID that he can somehow control\u00a0the\u00a0virus. My medicine cabinet is here to respond, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0The\u00a0Biden COVID ticket, that's\u00a0the\u00a0focus of tonight's\u00a0ANGLE. Now,\u00a0the\u00a0ANGLE\u00a0has been telling you for many months that COVID is Joe Biden's\u00a0true running mate. Using\u00a0the\u00a0virus panic button is all\u00a0they have.\u00a0Well,\u00a0the\u00a0only way to scare old people into voting for someone who seems\u00a0more like, I don't know, an assisted living resident than future president.\u00a0As if on cue in\u00a0the\u00a0final week of\u00a0the\u00a0campaign,\u00a0the\u00a0media is looking to\u00a0Vice President COVID to do\u00a0the\u00a0heavy lifting for old Joe. It's breathless\u00a024/7 COVID coverage as\u00a0the\u00a0case numbers hit a record high today in\u00a0the\u00a0U.S.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0The\u00a0average of daily cases here in\u00a0the\u00a0United States\u00a0hitting\u00a0the\u00a0highest point of\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0The\u00a0most ever in a single week.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Back to back numbers like we have never seen before.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's terrible. It's terrifying.\u00a0INGRAHAM: As\u00a0angle\u00a0viewers already know because you are super smart. Case\u00a0numbers are just one metric and not a particularly relevant one. We're\u00a0testing more than any other country in\u00a0the\u00a0world. So, of course, we're\u00a0picking up mild and asymptomatic cases, which thankfully account for\u00a0the\u00a0vast majority of all COVID cases in\u00a0the\u00a0United States.\u00a0The\u00a0COVID daily death rate has ticked up a little bit, but a shockingly\u00a0small amount given\u00a0the\u00a0dramatic rise in cases. This just supports what\u00a0we've been saying for a while now.\u00a0The\u00a0virus is likely attenuating and\u00a0we're getting a lot better at treating it. But to keep Joe's running mate\u00a0front and center,\u00a0the\u00a0fearmongering must remain at full tilt. Thus, it was\u00a0no surprise when Dr. Fauci fanned\u00a0the\u00a0flames during an October 15th Zoom\u00a0meeting hosted by Thomas Jefferson University.\u00a0He said it's not going to be\u00a0the\u00a0way it was with polio and measles, where\u00a0you get a vaccine, case closed. It's done. It's going to be public health\u00a0measures that linger for months and months. And Friday, Fauci added this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: If everyone agrees\u00a0that this is something that's important and\u00a0they mandated and everybody\u00a0pulls together and say, we're going to mandate it, but let's just do it. I\u00a0think that would be a great idea to have everybody do it uniformly. If\u00a0people are not wearing masks,\u00a0then maybe we should be mandating it.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: He also said that this could go on through 2021 into 2022. Well,\u00a0that basically ended up being an endorsement for Joe Biden, of course, and\u00a0hearing that drumbeat that we're going to have universal masking and that\u00a0we're going to have social distancing going into 2022. Well,\u00a0the\u00a0financial\u00a0markets took a significant hit today. Investors clearly don't want more\u00a0lockdowns, which would obviously put\u00a0the\u00a0brakes on our current recovery and\u00a0put tens of millions out of work.\u00a0Now, think about it this way. Why would anyone want to start a restaurant\u00a0in a country that is going to be shut down socially distanced? Why would\u00a0anyone invest in a country that could be closed to business altogether? And\u00a0why would anyone, for that matter, loan money to\u00a0the\u00a0United States if\u00a0that's our future for\u00a0the\u00a0foreseeable future? Yet\u00a0there's been one guy\u00a0consistently fighting this crushing blow of lockdowns and he lives over\u00a0there, Donald Trump.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0TRUMP: COVID, COVID, COVID, that's all\u00a0they talk about.\u00a0The\u00a0fake news\u00a0COVID, COVID, COVID. That's all\u00a0they talk about, what progress we've made\u00a0on it too, we understand it. We know we have to protect our seniors.It's a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown. He wants to\u00a0lockdown\u00a0the\u00a0country again.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Well,\u00a0the\u00a0Biden campaign and his press poodle's,\u00a0they went\u00a0bananas today because Trump's Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows said that we're\u00a0not going to control\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic. Of course, Meadows told\u00a0the\u00a0truth. This\u00a0is a terrible tragedy. And we mourn those who succumb to it. But it\u00a0originated in China, not Trump Tower. And\u00a0the\u00a0desperate attempt to\u00a0politicize it is absurd. It's venal.\u00a0It was\u00a0the\u00a0president who energetically dealt with\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic and\u00a0then he\u00a0decided to push for reopening, allowing states to make\u00a0their own decisions.\u00a0That decision saved countless jobs and lives. And thankfully, we now have\u00a0things like convalescent plasma\u00a0therapeutics, which we know work and we\u00a0know steroids can help later in more serious cases, something as simple as\u00a0taking Vitamin D3 and zinc over\u00a0the\u00a0counter supplements,\u00a0they can also help\u00a0protect you. We've talked about this for months and months on\u00a0the\u00a0angle.\u00a0And if you needed a reason for optimism, all you need to remember is that\u00a0the\u00a0president was in\u00a0the\u00a0hospital for three days with COVID and now, he\u00a0seems stronger than ever, crisscrossing\u00a0the\u00a0country. Three stops today\u00a0alone in Pennsylvania.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0TRUMP: Our opponents' agenda is one of doom and gloom and depression,\u00a0decline and despair. Our agenda is one of unlimited optimism. We want to be\u00a0optimistic. Remember during\u00a0the\u00a0debate, he said it will be a dark winter.\u00a0No, it's going to be a beautiful winter. It's going to be a beautiful\u00a0spring, OK?Our country is coming back stronger than anybody would have thought. And\u00a0you have to get your governor to open up your state what this guy is doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: That was a message to Governor Walz. And\u00a0the\u00a0crowd went crazy\u00a0when he said that. Now Biden and his shut down crowd have been lying to you\u00a0about COVID.\u00a0The\u00a0truth is, Joe's plan consists of what Trump has already\u00a0done on PPE and vaccine distribution plans, along with lockdowns, tracing\u00a0and tracking and mask mandates. Well, guess what? A lot of that, all of\u00a0that stuff is being done in Europe and what's happened\u00a0there. We'll get to\u00a0that.\u00a0Now, most Americans were already wearing masks. This survey comes out. 92\u00a0percent of 2200 Americans, poll said\u00a0they wear face masks when leaving\u00a0their home, with 74 percent saying\u00a0they always do. So, given\u00a0these facts,\u00a0the\u00a0notion that a national mass mandates going to make any difference on\u00a0COVID is a ludicrous distraction from reality. And as I said,\u00a0they've taken\u00a0all those measures in Europe that Biden's experts are pushing extended\u00a0lockdowns.\u00a0And guess what's happening now in\u00a0the\u00a0EU? France mandated masks, put a\u00a0national strategy in place, has widespread contact tracing and now a record\u00a0number of new cases in France.\u00a0The\u00a0same thing in Spain, which actually\u00a0brought in\u00a0the\u00a0military to do\u00a0their contact tracing.\u00a0But COVID is exploding\u00a0there as well, and new restrictions already in\u00a0place. In Germany, check this out, thousands marched in Berlin over\u00a0the\u00a0weekend to protest\u00a0their newest coronavirus restriction as cases have\u00a0search, especially in Berlin.\u00a0Now, you're not going to hear this on\u00a0the\u00a0other cable outlets. You're not\u00a0going to hear it from a lot of\u00a0the\u00a0experts. But Europe now has 250,000\u00a0COVID deaths, and its nation's economies are in\u00a0the\u00a0toilet compared to\u00a0ours. Again, understand this, Europe was supposedly\u00a0the\u00a0gold standard and\u00a0managed in COVID, now has more COVID deaths, and\u00a0they've wrecked\u00a0their\u00a0businesses,\u00a0their economies.\u00a0The\u00a0facts show, and so will history, that Trump was right. His approach was\u00a0more balanced.\u00a0Theirs was all in on lockdowns and restrictions, tracing and\u00a0tracking, and still it failed miserably.\u00a0The\u00a0Democrats, if successful,\u00a0heaven forbid, on November 3rd, if\u00a0they are in\u00a0there,\u00a0they're never going\u00a0to control\u00a0the\u00a0virus because that's not how viruses work. But Biden's\u00a0keepers will keep inflicting untold emotional, physical, and financial harm\u00a0onto millions of Americans with\u00a0their strategy. We must not allow that to\u00a0happen over a virus, even one as horrid and tragic and awful as this one.\u00a0We need to take reasonable precautions based and real science and heed\u00a0the\u00a0old Churchill line, stand firm and carry on.\u00a0And that's\u00a0THE\u00a0ANGLE.\u00a0Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall\u00a0Cardiology, founding member of\u00a0the\u00a0Medicine Cabinet. Dr. Oskoui, wonderful\u00a0to see you tonight.\u00a0DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST:\u00a0 Republican.INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Biden's COVID strategy consists of what that Donald Trump hasn't\u00a0already done?\u00a0The\u00a0big thing is, number one, lockdowns, correct, and number\u00a0two, national mask mandate. Will either one work?\u00a0OSKOUI:\u00a0 No. In fact, lockdowns and mandatory mask mandates are probably\u00a0slowing\u00a0the\u00a0onset of herd immunity. We want people who are generally\u00a0healthy to actually contract COVID if\u00a0they do naturally. If you're under\u00a0the\u00a0age of 50, you have got a 99.95 chance of survival. You need herd\u00a0immunity to develop, and that's going to be somewhere between about 50 and\u00a066 percent. Young healthy individuals get COVID,\u00a0they get sick,\u00a0they move\u00a0on with\u00a0their lives for\u00a0the\u00a0vast, vast majority.\u00a0Look at President Trump. He's 70 plus. He got COVID, he did beautifully. I\u00a0think that we need to talk about\u00a0the\u00a0fundamental issues, vitamin D, zinc.\u00a0If you're sick, quarantine. If you're fragile, vulnerable, again, stay\u00a0safe, quarantine. But\u00a0the\u00a0rest of us have to get\u00a0the\u00a0society moving. This\u00a0is a cruel experiment.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Dr. Oskoui, this is what\u00a0the\u00a0Obamacare architect Zeke Emanuel\u00a0said about\u00a0the\u00a0so-called herd strategy.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ZEKE EMANUEL, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE HEALTH POLICY ADVISER:\u00a0 Herd\u00a0immunity is not a strategy. It's\u00a0the\u00a0absence of a strategy. It has never\u00a0actually been shown that you can get immunity by just letting a disease run\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0population. If we get 200 million people in\u00a0the\u00a0United States\u00a0infected to get\u00a0the\u00a0herd immunity, that's probably 800,000 to 1 million\u00a0deaths that is going to be a result of that.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Push\u00a0the\u00a0panic button, Dr. Oskoui. You've got to do it a week\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0election.\u00a0OSKOUI:\u00a0 Herd immunity is neither a strategy or not a strategy. Herd\u00a0immunity is what viruses do like this. And I don't live rent free in Zeke\u00a0Emanuel's head, but I just don't know what he's thinking. What he says is\u00a0simply fearmongering, and it's not really germane to this conversation by\u00a0serious scientists that we both know.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Bill Gates lashed out as well at\u00a0the\u00a0White House COVID adviser\u00a0Dr. Scott Atlas today.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL GATES:\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0most maligned thing is where you start to attack your own\u00a0experts, and to suggest that maybe politicians know better than disease\u00a0experts. We now have a pseudo-expert advising\u00a0the\u00a0president.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Dr. Oskoui, where did Gates get his medical expertise again?\u00a0OSKOUI:\u00a0 Apparently, he's largely self-taught. But remember, Bill Gates\u00a0doesn't even have a college degree. What he does have is tremendous wealth\u00a0and power.\u00a0But unfortunately, what he hasn't pointed out is that Bill Gates'\u00a0tremendous bias toward vaccines. Remember what happened in\u00a0the\u00a0Sudan with\u00a0polio, and\u00a0the\u00a0WHO and Bill Gates. He pushes one line of approach to this\u00a0when really\u00a0there should be multiple lines.\u00a0But Scott Atlas has been incredibly diligent and really, quite frankly,\u00a0braving\u00a0the\u00a0swamp to really push real science and to put aside this\u00a0fearmongering. Bill Gates, really, unfortunately, has given too much of a\u00a0platform, and it's been to\u00a0the\u00a0detriment of\u00a0the\u00a0entire world. I think he's\u00a0desperate now.INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Well, Scott Atlas must be onto something if so many of\u00a0these\u00a0multibillionaire powermongers are after him. I like Scott Atlas more that\u00a0Bill Gates went after him. Dr. Oskoui, thanks so much, great to see you.\u00a0And up next, weekend at Biden's, what's old Joe up to this time? And Kamala\u00a0Harris can't quite remember where she is. Raymond Arroyo explains on a\u00a0can't-miss \"Seen and Unseen.\" Don't go away.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose\u00a0the\u00a0big cultural stories of\u00a0the\u00a0day. Joining us with all\u00a0the\u00a0details, FOX News\u00a0contributor Raymond Arroyo, author of\u00a0the\u00a0new book \"The\u00a0Spider who Saved\u00a0Christmas.\" Raymond,\u00a0the\u00a0media practically ignored Joe Biden's events of\u00a0the\u00a0weekend. Why?\u00a0RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0\u00a0They probably know his appearances,\u00a0Laura, raise questions about his competency.\u00a0They don't want to talk about\u00a0those Hunter Biden allegations. So\u00a0they made\u00a0the\u00a0decision.\u00a0They made a\u00a0decision to keep\u00a0their candidates in lockdown, standpat, and kill\u00a0the\u00a0clock. Biden did do a few events in Pennsylvania, Laura, over\u00a0the\u00a0weekend,\u00a0but\u00a0they barely got any coverage, though\u00a0there was a holiday scene in\u00a0Bristol.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 You could almost hear someone saying --\u00a0\u00a0(MUSIC)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 -- what is that rising in\u00a0the\u00a0pumpkin patch?\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 It's\u00a0the\u00a0sedate pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Though I think he is\u00a0having a little trouble finding where he supposed to go, Laura.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JILL BIDEN, JOE BIDEN'S WIFE:\u00a0 Our country will never settle for less than\u00a0our highest aspirations. OK, get ready for this one. Will you stand with\u00a0Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:\u00a0 Joe Biden's is like a human palm, Laura, he just bounces back and\u00a0forth. And even once he got his bearings,\u00a0then he got really amped up.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 I'm sick and tired of smart guys.\u00a0It is what it is because he is who he is.(END VIDEO CLIP)(LAUGHTER)ARROYO:\u00a0 He is starting to yell, Laura. He just screams into\u00a0the\u00a0parking\u00a0lots now. Those are\u00a0the\u00a0events. And\u00a0then he offered\u00a0the\u00a0dignified,\u00a0empathetic message to those who might not support him.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 I'll work as hard for those who don't\u00a0support me as those who do, including those chumps with\u00a0the\u00a0microphone out\u00a0there. We don't do things like those chumps out\u00a0there with\u00a0the\u00a0microphones\u00a0are doing,\u00a0the\u00a0Trump guys.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:\u00a0 Don't you love that, Laura? This is\u00a0the\u00a0empathy candidates,\u00a0dignity, all\u00a0the\u00a0chumps over\u00a0there. It erodes his argument for running\u00a0every time he loses it goes off script like this.\u00a0(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Ray, he reminds me of someone who used to live in our\u00a0neighborhood growing up who we used to cut across his lawn on\u00a0the\u00a0way to\u00a0the\u00a0bus stop.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 That's right. You chumps, get off my lawn!\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Oh, no, no. Screaming at us to stop doing\u00a0the\u00a0cut through. And\u00a0he would scream. That just took me a flashback to Connecticut growing up.\u00a0It's hilarious.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Laura,\u00a0there were also a few slips of\u00a0the\u00a0tongue that both Biden\u00a0and Harris committed of\u00a0the\u00a0weekend. As Richard John Neuhaus used to say,\u00a0slips of\u00a0the\u00a0tongue belie slips of\u00a0the\u00a0heart and slips of\u00a0the\u00a0soul. Listen\u00a0closely to this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 We have put together, I think,\u00a0the\u00a0most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in\u00a0the\u00a0history of\u00a0American politics.\u00a0SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 He was on\u00a0the\u00a0debate stage, as we just saw,\u00a0the\u00a0last,\u00a0the\u00a0debate before last, and refused\u00a0to condone white supremacists.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 All right, well, one of Biden's virtual star-studded events has\u00a0exploded on\u00a0the\u00a0Internet. I'll let you explain. Watch.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0character of\u00a0the\u00a0country, in my\u00a0view, is literally on\u00a0the\u00a0ballot. What kind of country are we going to be?\u00a0Four more years of George -- George, he's going to find ourselves in a\u00a0position where, if Trump gets elected, we're going to be -- we're going to\u00a0be in a different world. And so -- and\u00a0the\u00a0reason why I think people should\u00a0be voting is out\u00a0the\u00a0of\u00a0their own self-interest right now because, look,\u00a0everything is at stake, from\u00a0the\u00a0environment to our health. You heard what\u00a0his chief of staff --\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Climate change?\u00a0BIDEN:\u00a0 That's what I'm talking about.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:\u00a0 He snapped at her, Laura.\u00a0There's that hair trigger temper. I was\u00a0talking about climate change.\u00a0Some thought Joe Biden was confusing Trump with George W. Bush, or George\u00a0Bush. That's not quite\u00a0the\u00a0case. We have got to put this in context. Biden\u00a0makes enough gaffes and mistakes without having to create\u00a0them. What\u00a0actually happened here, he was talking to George Lopez,\u00a0the\u00a0comedian. He\u00a0was reading\u00a0the\u00a0teleprompter and couldn't follow. I think he got lost and\u00a0bungled up, and\u00a0then he snapped at Jill when she tried to correct\u00a0them. It\u00a0happens.INGRAHAM:\u00a0 That's good, Robert. Whatever your name is.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Thank you, Susie.\u00a0(LAUGHTER)ARROYO:\u00a0 It was great be with you tonight at\u00a0the\u00a0Amy Coney event. What an\u00a0incredible --\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Yes, we were socially distanced, in masks.ARROYO:\u00a0 Yes, in masks.INGRAHAM:\u00a0 We had it all down, but it was a beautiful event, and socially\u00a0distanced. Raymond, great to see you.\u00a0And still ahead, what's it like being a Trump supporter on a college\u00a0campus. Dinesh D'Souza responds to\u00a0the\u00a0rampant radicalism silencing college\u00a0conservatives, next.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 If you were going to vote for President Trump, I'm not asking\u00a0how you'd vote, but you would be reluctant to share that with someone that\u00a0perhaps you don't know that well?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Yes. So I went to a campaign rally, had a few things\u00a0on, and when I came back to campus, I instantly took\u00a0them off in\u00a0the\u00a0car\u00a0before I came back on because I'm afraid of how people would react to me.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 It's never being easy being a conservative on campus, but\u00a0the\u00a0intolerance keeping pro-Trump students from speaking\u00a0their mind is seeping\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0rest of our society. Joining me now, Dinesh D'Souza, conservative\u00a0commentator whose film \"Trump Card\" is fantastic. It's available now on\u00a0demand. Watch it.Dinesh, it's gotten to\u00a0the\u00a0point where everyday Americans can't put up\u00a0Trump flags, stickers on\u00a0their car without being harassed or even attacked\u00a0now.\u00a0DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:\u00a0 I think it's gotten to an\u00a0intolerable level. When we were students a generation ago, we were young\u00a0Reaganites in\u00a0the\u00a01980s, and of course we were outnumbered by\u00a0the\u00a0left on\u00a0the\u00a0campus. But we never felt we couldn't speak our minds, we couldn't\u00a0organize politically.\u00a0There were conservative professors on\u00a0the\u00a0campus. And\u00a0there was debate. Students were aware of different points of view.\u00a0I think what's frightening now is\u00a0the\u00a0sort of uniformity that's being\u00a0imposed on\u00a0the\u00a0campus. So it's\u00a0the\u00a0antithesis of what liberal education is\u00a0all about. in fact, I'm pretty convinced that if Socrates were to walk on\u00a0American campus today,\u00a0the\u00a0professors would surround him and make him drink\u00a0the\u00a0hemlock all over again.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Dinesh, at Ohio State last week, I was just stunned at how\u00a0the\u00a0students are adapting to\u00a0the\u00a0COVID restrictions, But how\u00a0they want\u00a0them\u00a0done.\u00a0They're like, this is so unfair what's happening to us. We're paying\u00a0all this money, we're not getting to be in most of our classes. And\u00a0they're\u00a0kind of soldiering on, but you can see that\u00a0they get it, that this is\u00a0ridiculous at this point. It's a tragedy, but you can't keep doing this.\u00a0D'SOUZA:\u00a0\u00a0There's a natural idealism and also rebelliousness in young\u00a0people, and I think that those two things are actually very powerful\u00a0engines of education, because it's part of what makes young people question\u00a0things, challenge things. But\u00a0they need\u00a0the\u00a0intellectual and social freedom\u00a0to do that. So when\u00a0the\u00a0colleges come down and drop this blanket all over\u00a0them, I think ultimately that you're paying not only a social price but\u00a0also an intellectual price.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 And Dinesh,\u00a0the\u00a0attacks on Jewish Trump supporters in New York\u00a0was stunning over\u00a0the\u00a0weekend. A massive rally, a car rally, in New York\u00a0City.\u00a0They were greeted by deranged anti-Trump nuts throwing rocks and\u00a0other things at\u00a0their cars. And leftists ripped flags off\u00a0the\u00a0car, et\u00a0cetera, pepper sprayed children. What is this, Dinesh? This\u00a0the\u00a0tolerant\u00a0left?\u00a0D'SOUZA:\u00a0 This is\u00a0the\u00a0way in which Antifa, if you will, or\u00a0the\u00a0Antifa\u00a0sensibility meets\u00a0the\u00a0fascist sensibility. It's not just that\u00a0they have\u00a0the\u00a0same costumes,\u00a0the\u00a0same tactics of intimidation and bullying, but now both\u00a0sides are picking on\u00a0the\u00a0Jews. One of\u00a0the\u00a0Nazis' complaints about\u00a0the\u00a0Jews\u00a0was that\u00a0the\u00a0Jews embodied capitalism,\u00a0the\u00a0capitalist spirit. And you see\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0Antifa people hate\u00a0the\u00a0Jews pretty much for\u00a0the\u00a0same reason.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 That's horrible. Dinesh,\u00a0congrats\u00a0again on\u00a0the\u00a0film, \"Trump\u00a0Card.\" Really appreciate seeing you tonight.\u00a0And still ahead, words of wisdom from our newest Supreme Court justice.\u00a0The\u00a0Last Bite explains.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Tonight, right here at\u00a0the\u00a0White House, our newest Supreme Court\u00a0Justice Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in. This was part of her message to\u00a0the\u00a0country.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AMY CONEY BARRETT, FEDERAL APPEALS COURT NOMINEE:\u00a0 My fellow Americans,\u00a0even though we judges don't face elections, we still work for you. I will\u00a0do my job without any fear or favor. And that I will do so independently of\u00a0both\u00a0the\u00a0political branches and of my own preferences.

            "article_content": " Don\u2019t voters get it? Don\u2019t they understand by now that most Democrats\u00a0appear to have almost zero interest in advancing the welfare of African-Americans? Too many Democrat politicians are almost entirely motivated by money and power.\u00a0They appear to be utterly content with the essentially unchanged situation in the black community which continues to provide them with both.\u00a0Protests like those over the recent police killing of George Floyd bring in huge amounts of cash from white liberals guilt-ridden over their \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d Widespread demonstrations also spur higher turnout among black voters. Since Democrats traditionally win 90 percent of the black vote, reminders of racial injustice are key to their election hopes. That\u2019s just how it is. LIZ PEEK: INTOLERANCE THREATENS US\u00a0\u2013 HERE'S WHO TO BLAME FOR 'CANCEL CULTURE' We could cite no better example of their cynicism than the recent move by Senate Democrats, led by Kamala Harris, to block consideration of a police reform bill put forward by Republicans. They deemed it \u201cinadequate,\u201d but according to Tim Scott, the black GOP senator from South Carolina, Democrats \u201cdidn\u2019t stick around for\u201d a meeting in which he \u201coffered to include an amendment for every concern that was presented.\u201d\u00a0 He tweeted, \u201cI offered Democrats the chance to offer AT LEAST 20 amendments. They walked out.\u201d Scott said in a Senate floor speech, \u201cI finally realized what the problem is. The actual problem is not what is being offered. It is who is offering it.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Of course.\u00a0Democrats\u00a0can\u2019t have\u00a0Republicans putting forward a police reform measure, not this close to election time. Democrats in the House, meanwhile, didn\u2019t even pretend to work across the aisle to craft their own bill.\u00a0As Ken Calvert, GOP representative from California, tweeted, the \u201cHouse Rules Committee Democrats just voted to bring their police reform bill to the floor under a CLOSED rule that will not allow a SINGLE Republican amendment. It\u2019s becoming obvious they\u2019d rather play politics with this issue than find common ground for the good of the country.\u201d The critical point here is that Democrats knew their efforts at obstruction would lead to no bill. No police reform. No change. So what if lives\u00a0might be\u00a0saved? Instead of important reforms, Democrats signal their solidarity with pointless gestures. When the country erupted in righteous anger over the death of George Floyd, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided, in her 31st year serving in the House of Representatives, that the long-standing portraits of former House speakers who allied with the Confederacy were a disgrace. She put her Louboutin-clad foot down and imperiously demanded their removal. Just like that, she virtue-signaled her\u00a0deep-seated\u00a0concern about racism.\u00a0It only took 30 years. Pelosi\u2019s stunt is typical of the \u201ctokenism\u201d derided recently by BET Founder Robert Johnson, who\u00a0in an interview mocked whites tearing down statues and other\u00a0unhelpful\u00a0overtures. \"You know, black people, in my opinion, black people laugh at white people who do this the same way we laugh at white people who say we got to take off the TV shows,\" the black billionaire claimed. Yes, the unraveling of Minneapolis, the collapse of Detroit, the poverty of Philadelphia \u2013 these problems have not been addressed by Democrats. They have been\u00a0caused\u00a0by Democrats. Johnson scoffed at those\u00a0meaningless\u00a0actions, saying\u00a0\"It's not going to give a kid whose parents can't afford college money to go to college. It's not going to close the labor gap between what white workers are paid and what black workers are paid. And it's not going to take people off welfare or food stamps.\u201d Scott noted in his Senate floor speech, \u201cDetroit. Atlanta. Minneapolis. Los Angeles. Philadelphia. All of these communities have been run by Democrats for decades.\" Yes, the unraveling of Minneapolis, the collapse of Detroit, the poverty of Philadelphia \u2013 these problems have not been addressed by Democrats. They have been\u00a0caused\u00a0by Democrats. Let\u2019s start with education, since terrible inner-city schools are a major source of black poverty and failure. In Baltimore, where per-pupil spending is among the highest in the country, five high schools and one middle school in 2016 reported not one student \u2013 not one\u00a0\u2013 scored proficient in math or reading. How can anyone with a conscience tolerate this? Easy \u2013 for Democrats, it literally pays to look the other way. Democrats take tens of millions of dollars every election cycle from teachers\u2019 unions. Those unions protect the status quo in our public schools, even in failing schools in the minority communities of cities like New York and Baltimore. In turn, Democrats protect the unions, sidelining reforms. Black parents understand the problem, which is why tens of thousands are left on charter school\u00a0waitlists each year in New York, for instance. They might wonder \u2013 why\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0the governor and mayor allow more charters, since there is so much demand? The answer: the unions forbid it. How about jobs? This is normally the last priority\u00a0for Democrat politicians, even though it routinely tops the list of black voters\u2019 concerns. Officials in blue states would prefer to hand out welfare than encourage an independent, successful black\u00a0community. If you doubt this, consider\u00a0how Democrat officials looked the other way as hundreds of black-owned businesses in Minneapolis, New York and other cities were looted and burned during the George Floyd protests.\u00a0Could they have prevented the destruction? Yes, by sending in the National Guard. Will rebuilding those neighborhoods be their first priority? We shall see. It isn\u2019t just what Democrats haven\u2019t done for blacks that matters. It\u2019s also that they\u2019ve balanced their budgets with items like taxes on sodas and lottery ticket sales, which target mainly black and brown poor people. They raise energy prices by demanding the use of more renewables, with the higher cost weighing most on low-income people of color.

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC received a wave of backlash from some quarters on Twitter Wednesday after\u00a0 publishing a graphic linking things like the nuclear family and self-reliance to whiteness. The graphic, which is part of a \"talking about race\" article on the taxpayer-funded museum's website, discusses how white dominant culture, or whiteness, have instilled a long list of values in the U.S. \"Since white people still hold most of the institutional power in America, we have all internalized some aspects of white culture -- including people of color,\" it reads. The museum's graphic breaks the \"aspects and assumptions of whiteness\" into categories such as \"rugged individualism\" and \"history.\" For example, under \"future orientation,\" the graphic lists \"delayed gratification\" and planning for the future as ideas spread\u00a0by white culture. Others aspects of whiteness include: \"Objective, rational linear thinking\"; \"cause and effect relationships\"; hard work being the key to \"success\"; respect for authority; \"decision-making\"; a \"steak and potatoes\" aesthetic; children having their own rooms in a household; and the idea that \"intent counts\" in justice. LORI LOUGHLIN'S DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE FACES BACKLASH AFTER 'WHITE PRIVILEGE' POST: 'CLUELESS AND TONE DEAF' Some Twitter users, many of them on the conservative side of the political spectrum, called the graphic racist. \"This is really outrageous and overtly racist,\" Erick Erickson tweeted. SEATTLE OFFERS CLASSES ON 'WHITE FRAGILITY,' TO EXPLAIN ROOTS OF GUILT \"It's not just crazy, it's evil and counterproductive,\" conservative author Ben Shapiro tweeted. \"It suggests that all pathways to success -- hard work, stable family structure, individual decisionmaking -- represent complicity in white supremacy. Which incentivizes all the paths to failure, of course.\" The controversy came in the wake of politically charged nationwide protests sparked in part by the May 25 death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. Since the Black Lives Matter protests took off, many have promoted a deeper discussion about race by referring to books such as \"White Fragility,\" whose author, Robin D'Angelo, was featured in the museum's article. The NMAAHC's article also quoted author Peggy McIntosh in saying:\u00a0\u201cWhite privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, code books, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The museum did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Located in Washington, D.C., the museum opened to the public in 2016. Congress established the museum in 2003 and, according to its website, is\u00a0\"the\u00a0only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture.\"",

Vought cited reports of executive branch employees being taught in the classes --\u00a0designed to educate employees about \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and other concepts -- that \u201cvirtually all White people contribute to racism\u201d and that it is racist to believe that America is a land of opportunity. \u201cThese types of \u2018trainings\u2019 not only run counter to the fundamental beliefs for which our Nation has stood since its inception, but they also engender division and resentment within the Federal workforce,\u201d Vought said. CHRIS RUFO CALLS ON TRUMP TO END CRITICAL RACE THEORY 'CULT INDOCTRINATION' IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT The move\u00a0comes\u00a0after Discovery Institute researcher Christopher Rufo told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that \"critical race theory\" had become the default ideology of the federal government. Rufo pointed to several of his own findings, including that Sandia National Laboratories -- which designs nuclear weapons -- held a mandatory retreat titled, \"White Men\u2019s Caucus on Eliminating Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia in Organizations.\u201d A training document obtained by Rufo listed a series of \"examples of white male culture.\" Those included \"golf,\" \"quick decisions,\" \"self-confident,\" \"risk taking,\" \"brave,\" and other attributes that the document notes were \"generated by participants.\" In July, the federally-created\u00a0National Museum for African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) faced a wave of backlash for publishing a graphic that linked things like the nuclear family and \"decision-making\" to whiteness. The museum later removed the graphic. Rufo claims to have found instances of similar trainings across a long list of federal agencies, including the FBI. Proponents of the training say it can help the government eliminate\u00a0bias in areas such as the awarding of federal contracts. M.E. Hart, an attorney who has conducted diversity training sessions for businesses and the federal government, told The Washington Post that it also can improve morale, cooperation and efficiency. \u201cIf we are going to live up to this nation\u2019s promise -- \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\u2019 --\u00a0we have to see each other as human beings, and we have to do whatever it takes, including taking whatever classes make that possible,\u201d Hart told the Post. \u201cThese classes have been very powerful in allowing people to do that, and we need them more than ever. There\u2019s danger here.\u201d In his\u00a0memo, Vought warned that the training \u201cseeks to undercut our core values as Americans and drive division within our workforce.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThe President has directed me to ensure that Federal agencies cease and desist from using taxpayer dollars to fund these divisive, un-American propaganda training sessions,\u201d he said.

This is a rush transcript from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\" September 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. INGRAHAM: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE.From Washington tonight, Joe Biden made it clear as can be today. Under his administration, he will mandate lockdowns and masks nationwide. Our medicine cabinet, with a twist, breaks it all down.\u00a0Also, is the Left going to regret the devil's bargain they made with the Black Lives Matters movement? Candice Owens shares her thoughts.\u00a0And Raymond Arroyo, he hit the streets of Florida. To hear from voters and that key battleground state, that in Biden's rough trip to the Sunshine State in seen and unseen ahead.But first, the comeback kid. That's the focus of today's ANGLE.Now, you'd never know it if you just checked out Facebook or you scrolled Insta, or watched those other networks that Sean and I were just talking about, but right now we're in the midst of the great American comeback.Now, remember not long ago, what the media was predicting for our economy because of COVID?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The handling of the coronavirus pandemic is not good for the president. That is bad news for the economy.DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Just decimated our economy.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Great-depression era levels of unemployment.\u00a0CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: What happened to this being the best economy in the world? Economy's worst drop ever. Ever! OK?(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: OK. Well, thankfully the experts doom-and-gloom scenario hasn't come to fruition. Now why is that? Because President Trump made the smart decision to allow states to make their own reopening decisions and because his treasury secretary pushed through the COVID stimulus package.Now America's economy is actually recovering again. You are not going to see this anywhere else at an impressive pace.Now here are the new OECD GDP projections from member nations. Now you can see from the list that despite taking a slight hit, we did far better than other G7 nations.\u00a0Now, imagine how much better the U.S.' numbers would have been if New York and California weren't slow-rolling their reopenings, or imagine how much worse off we would have been if Biden were incharge and none of our states were allowed to open under his national guidelines.Well, this afternoon Biden was asked about the good news on the economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS, CBS NEWS: A quick question on the economy. The Fed today announced that their projections for unemployment are actually going to be lower than expected. In polling, we see time and again that President Trump has an edge over you on the economy. Why do you think that is?JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, because I don't think I've been out of office for four years. And they don't - it's a long time, four years ago.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Is he kidding me? Actually, we remember quite well, Joe. And by the time Obama and Biden left office, average median income had gone up.\u00a0But that only meant that the income levels had returned to the year 2000 levels, meaning, they barely got us to the Clinton levels of prosperity, but not the case with Trump's numbers.\u00a0\n\u00a0The census just reported that the United States median wages broke a record in 2019, the highest recorded since they began tracking it. This means that Trump's policies were working for the average family. The poverty rate, that hit an all-time low as well. And income was going up across the board, increasing 7 percent from the year prior to more than 68,700 from 64,324.\u00a0That is a $4,000 raise. Real money to real people among the highest increases ever recorded.\u00a0OK, now, that's all well and good. But what about Trump's record in international affairs? I mean that was supposed to be failing, right? I mean, I still remember all the foreign policy experts and what they were predicting in this arena.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0RULA JEBREAL, MSNBC COMMENTATOR: This kind of policy, unilateral decision, will basically wreck the Middle East.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What he's done is thrown a diplomatic bomb in to the Middle East peace process.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This could kill hopes for Middle East peace.ALI VELSHI, MSNBC HOST: And it's not looking good for Jared Kushner's Middle East plan.JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: How could Jared Kushner plausibly still lead Middle East peace efforts?(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Oh, my god. Those are the best. I didn't even see those before now. Those were good. These people have a perfect record of failing in predictions about the Trump presidency.\u00a0The COVID models gave us more accurate forecasts than those morons.\u00a0Remember, how bad those were? Really bad.Now the signing of the Abraham Accords negotiated by the Trump team, including Jared Kushner led by him really was great news for everyone that claimed to care about peace on earth. Of course, for the media, true to form, well, that whole peace on earth thing is secondary to beating Trump.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today's ceremony showcased the President's continued defiance of the very coronavirus guidelines, his White House recommends.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hundreds of guests were packed on the South Lawn with little social distancing and optional masks.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This deal is a bit uncomfortable for a lot of observers to watch, because it seems so transactional.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's more of a business deal than a peace accord.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is not Middle East peace.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: And I still remember when Wolf Blitzer claimed to care a lot about international news.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Why does the White House and the Trump campaign refuse to follow the administration's own health guidelines?JARED KUSHNER, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR: So I was watching as I was waiting to come on the show here and all the clips you were showing of people without masks were people who are in the front rows. Those were administration officials who were tested.\u00a0BLITZER: Don't you think, Jared, that the president and the top advisers to the president, like you, should set an example for the American public?KUSHNER: People have a first amendment right and that's something that CNN has vociferously argued for. I didn't hear you and CNN being that worried when you saw people out there doing protests in different ways.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN, the most trusted name in news.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: OK. Now that's funny. Where does James Earl Jones get to have his voiceover return to him? But the great news isn't really happening on the economic and foreign policy fronts. President Trump has a magic touch for football as well.Now, a few weeks ago, I asked him about the Big Ten canceling their season.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0TRUMP: I'm the football guy. I'm the one that wants to have football. I put it out all the time. I'm very upset with Big Ten. Big Ten, they should have opened it.I want football back, by the way. Are you watching? I want football. OK?(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Now players, their families and fans were outraged by the Big Ten's attempt to cancel fall sports. So Trump made a few phone calls and in speeches he encouraged the league to reverse its decision. And that's exactly what the Big Ten did. This is great news for the state and local economies, the players, who dedicated their lives to the sport and for the national psyche. We all love football.Now, would they have reversed course if Trump hadn't talked about it or intervened? Doubtful.The sports media, by the way, predicted it wouldn't happen, because they didn't want football to restart. It's a strange thing, sports media, these days. It's shameful.Now the Democrats and their cronies and the press underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. We all remember that. And they seem to be repeating their mistake in 2020. From the economy to foreign policy to sports, he's on a roll. And that is not just good news for his chances in November, it's good for America.The Trump resistance is always wondering why are these people so loyal to Trump. Why do they stand in line for hours and even days sometimes to see his rallies? Why do thousands of boats line up for these Trump water parades? Because his policies put money in those people's pockets. He respects their freedoms, too. That's why. And that's THE ANGLE.And on the issue of appreciating freedom, my next guest has just picked up his entire operation and moved it out of California.Joining me now is Ben Shapiro, The Daily Wire Editor-In-Chief and author of \"How To Destroy America In Three Easy Steps.\"Ben, I think your move comes at an interesting time as my ANGLE noted this country is seeing two distinct visions of the country and freedom seems to be the central dividing point. Is that what you're saying?BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY WIRE: That's exactly right. I spent my entire life in California, literally all 36 years of my life with three years taken out for law school. All of it was spent in California. I love this state, I grew up in this state, I was married in this state, I have had children in this state. My parents moved to the state long before I was born, we're out. We are taking our 75 employees, we are moving to Nashville, because this state bad governance has consequences.It turns out that when you raise taxes and when you threaten to raise taxes more, when you provide absolutely crappy public services and quality of life continues to degrade, when you undermine the police, when you prevent them from being able to enforce the law, when you allow 66,000 homeless people who are - many of whom are mentally ill and drug addicted to sleep on the streets in L.A. County and declare yourselves freer and better.And when the real compensation for all of this is that you can plunk a dumb lawn sign on your lawns declaring you are on virtue because it says Black Lives Matter, or love is love. I'm sorry that is not a great place to raise children, it is not a great place to build a company. And we decided we're moving and guess what, most of our employees are thrilled about it.\u00a0INGRAHAM: Now Ben, I need to get to some breaking news tonight. Do you remember back in June when Kamala Harris promoted that bail fund? I know you talked about it on your pod cast for writers in Minnesota, and then 13 Biden staffers donated to the same fund. While The Daily Caller News Foundation now reported, just moments ago, that the bail fund helped a man accused of sexually assaulting an 8-year-old girl get out of jail in July.The donation page that Kamala Harris tweeted out for this bail fund is still active and it still has her image plastered on the side. Ben, reaction?SHAPIRO: I don't know why this is a shock at all. This is the same Kamala Harris who decided that it was absolutely worthwhile to go visit the family of Jacob Blake and in fact said that she was proud of Jacob Blake, an alleged rapist, remember. That Jacob Blake was only shot because the police were called to the home of the alleged victim of the rape, who said that the alleged rapist was back, the cops show up, he resists arrest, he attempts to apparently assault the police officers, he maybe has a knife on him, he certainly has a knife on the floorboards of his car before he was shot.\u00a0And Kamala Harris and Joe Biden made their decision, now let's decide with the criminal. He attempt to walk all of that stuff back right now is going to, I think, be of little avail.INGRAHAM: Now in earlier in the summer, the Minneapolis City Council voted to abolish their police force as we all remember and the council president was all in favor of it. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0LISA BENDER, PRESIDENT, MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL: A lot of us were asked if we could imagine a future without police. And I answered yes to that question. Stop investing so much money in this militarized police force and instead invest in the things that our community really needs.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: And reimagining didn't go so well. Now Ben, she's having second thoughts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BENDER: I also hear from constituents that rank and file officers on the street are telling them that they're not enforcing crime. It's - people don't understand. Trust in our department and in our city is deeply eroded and this is not helping.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Ben, I was in Minneapolis earlier this summer and it's a - it's become a complete and utter dangerous joke. Why are these people surprised?\u00a0And why do they still keep getting re-elected?SHAPIRO: It's unbelievable. From what I understand, this is the same city manager who wants our national television and when asked about if she was worried that she might have to call the cops because the crime was being committed, she said she might have to check her privilege. Because her normal white privilege might cause her to call the cops apparently, the privilege crept back in.And now she realizes that after all, when somebody actually is committing a crime, that's a bad thing for your city. Businesses are fleeing Minneapolis, businesses are fleeing California, businesses are fleeing Oregon. This is going to continue. You are going to see people who earn, people who have the capacity to get out or going to leave badly governed areas. Bad governance has consequences. This is going to happen across the country, and it's all fun and games until everybody who pays the taxes takes off.\u00a0INGRAHAM: But Ben, if Joe Biden is president, there is no escaping. Because there is going to be national mandates. There is no escaping. You are not going to be able to escape to states, because it's all going to be one standard for dealing with COVID and one standard of lockdowns. That's the concern.Ben, great to see you tonight. And good luck on the move, if we don't talk to you beforehand.And while the White House and Senate take up much of the oxygen, should Nancy Pelosi suddenly be worried about her house majority? She calls herself a master legislator. But over the last years, she has led her caucus from one political quagmire to the other, has accomplished nothing, most recently blocking trillions of dollars in economic aid. And after all the lockdown doesn't really affect her, she could still go to the salon and so forth. But don't worry, she's genuinely heart broken.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): When it comes to the coronavirus, they have contempt for science. That's why we lost almost 200,000 people, who will lose their lives by the end of this week, 200,000 people. And that is why they have contempt for science as to what the climate crisis is.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: And the award goes to? The best drama. How authentic, Nance. But she should be praying, because according to Politico, there were grumblings from rank-and-file House Dems about the need to cut a deal on the COVID stimulus. But none of them will actually seriously challenge Pelosi in public, because they don't seriously care about their constituents. They only care about not getting primaried by an AOC-approved candidate.The fact is, House Democrats, especially those in swing states, still need two things to survive, cash from Nancy and the party establishment; and again, avoiding getting challenged by the Left, so they sit quietly while Pelosi lets the radicals go wild.So if you're a swing voter, why would you grant another majority to the Democrat Party with no moderates, at least none who speak out, and pretty much no accomplishments? And let's not forget that the House Democrats have accomplished zero on the issues that they claim to care about, because they don't want to work with Donald Trump. Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi just said, \"Oh, forget about him\". When she was asked, do you regret not meeting him for a year?They did the impeachment drama, which was shameful and they have a bitter attitude about everything else. But they're going to try to claim credit for what, the USMCA, which was all Trump. It's just ridiculous.\u00a0Joining us now, and I'm delighted he is with us, Kevin McCarthy, of course, the House Minority Leader. He will join us now.And Congressman McCarthy, I don't think, retaking the house is a pipe dream anymore. I thought it was a few months ago, but not anymore.\u00a0REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): It's not. Do you know that there are fewer Democrats in the House since Nancy Pelosi held the gavel? At that moment, we needed 19 seats to win the majority. Today, we only need 17. We won every special election we played in, and that was in Democrat seats that Democrats won by more than nine points and it happened to be in California.The real question is, what are the results of the Democrats? They should be embarrassed of how much they have embraced the socialist? Name me one problem this Democrat majority has solved? There isn't one.But you know what the Republicans have done? We rolled out a commitment to America. All you have to do is gohttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__commitmenttoamerica.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=ffARakSOi2FbfQxwk_4I9-aZq3Wy1RopIHiJD-15WuE&s=S5T3o8glEzXo1lAGofjMOZSBTHnztCGHrlNi5akFkN4&e=\u00a0 and you could see for yourself. We are going to rebuild the biggest economy we have ever seen, at 10 million new jobs. We're going to restore our way of life. You know what we're going to do? We're going to end COVID, because we're going to create a safe and effective vaccine. We protect pre-existing conditions.And you know what? We don't defund the cops, we add 1.75 billion, to make more police training. Community policing and more importantly, 500,000 body cameras.INGRAHAM: Congressman, let me just jump in here. When is the last time you had a substantive in depth conversation with Nancy Pelosi about anything?MCCARTHY: I'm around her many times in many meetings, but I can't say I have a substantive talk with her in more than a year. Think for a moment, yesterday we watched world peace happen for the Middle East on the steps inside the White House. You know what Nancy Pelosi did? She turned down the invitation and she held votes in the floor of the House trying to make members not go there and witness--INGRAHAM: Just sickening.\u00a0MCCARTHY: --Bahrain and UAE, represent and acknowledge Israel.INGRAHAM: All right. Congressman, I want to get your reaction on breaking news, just reported by Politco. Fox News has now confirmed it, that the freedom caucus is pressing you to launch long shot bid to oust her, on Nancy Pelosi, it's a procedural gambit, has virtually no chance of success, but it could force vulnerable Democrats to align with the speaker ahead of the election. Congressman, explain this. Are you in favor of it?MCCARTHY: Well, what I'm in favor of is defeating Nancy Pelosi and Nadler and all the others. If we were able to remove Nancy Pelosi, we'd have another Democrat. The real challenge would be we're four weeks away from election, 47 days, these Democrats could actually vote against Nancy Pelosi, use it in their campaigns to say they're not with her, even though they vote with her 95 percent of the time, because she doesn't need all the votes to stay because of the majority.\u00a0INGRAHAM: So you're not going to do it? Are you going to do that or not?MCCARTHY: I don't think it's the best move at this moment. I think the best move is when 218 seats and that defeats Nancy Pelosi. But you know what else it defeats? Nadler, Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff and the others, that is our best play right now.INGRAHAM: Do you agree with me that there is really two things at play:\u00a0one, which all of you do, you need to raise money; two, when you're a Democrat and you're kind of in the - you thought you were a moderate, you're just petrified of getting primaried by the AOC plus three. And so, you are caught between raising money from the establishment, Pelosi, and not getting primaried, so you basically just shut up.MCCARTHY: Yes. You watched AOC primary and beat people this year. They're all afraid. AOC is the one that got Pelosi to impeach - do impeachment, because she went out starting primarying people for them to do that. There was no basis for it. That's what they wasted their majority on.\u00a0When you look at the Democrat majority, what have they stood for? Defunding of the police, dismantling of this nation, because they want to go with impeachment.\u00a0INGRAHAM: Open borders.\u00a0MCCARTHY: Open borders. And you know what they want to do? They pretty much want to destroy this, because they want to raise taxes on the very first day, regardless of where this economy is at. They haven't build any new jobs, they haven't lowered the drug price, they haven't made this country better. So if you renew this nation, you rebuild the biggest economy, you restore our way of life. You know what happens? You reunite this nation.\u00a0INGRAHAM: All right.\u00a0MCCARTHY: And that's what the commitment to America is all about.\u00a0INGRAHAM: All right, Congressman. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.\u00a0We really appreciate it.And coming up, Joe Biden said the quiet part out loud. His administration would call for COVID restrictions that would end up locking you down and controlling almost every aspect of your life, well into next year. Is that constitutional? Will it make any medical difference?\u00a0Alex Berenson and Dr. Ramin Oskoui will tell us next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Joe Biden made it really clear today, if you were watching, that he would allow unelected health officials to dictate your life under COVID.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BIDEN: Just concluded 1.5 hour long briefing with seven of our nation's top public health experts. And I spoke to the experts today, I also spoke to the experts this morning, and I'll support rather than tear down the experts based on the proposal laid out by the experts.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Remember who these experts are? They're the ones whose model said New York would need, what, 45,000 ventilators? They're also the ones who said, we would see, what, 2 million dead and promise that flattening the curve was purely about saving hospitals? And they haven't been consistent on the efficacy of masks.So shouldn't it alarm people that Biden would basically turn over key government decisions to unelected experts?\u00a0Joining me now is Alex Berenson, author of Unreported Truths about COVID and Lockdowns; and Dr. Ramin Oskoui, Cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in Washington.Alex, instead of giving these so-called experts more power, shouldn't Americans demand that they be held accountable for all of their own screwups?ALEX BERENSON, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER: I think that would be a good place to start. I mean it's quite clear that the move to lockdowns in March and April was made out of panic. It contradicted decades of public health advice and there's very, very little evidence it did anything to help slow this - I mean it may have slowed the spread of the virus, but it didn't really change the course of the virus as we can now see based on what's happening in Spain and other countries in Europe. And what it certainly did was crush the economies of regions or countries that locked down hard. So I think an honest discussion about that would be a good place to start.\u00a0INGRAHAM: Well, Dr. Oskoui, I want to play this from the CDC Director, Robert Redfield, earlier today and then the president's response later on.\u00a0Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CDC: I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.TRUMP: The mask is not as important as the vaccine. When I called up Robert today, I said to him, what is with the mask? He said, I think I answered that question incorrectly.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: OK. Well, Redfield walked back his comments on Twitter tonight, Doctor. I was saying, he 100 percent believes in the importance of the vaccine. What is going on here with this cross-messaging, Dr. Oskoui?RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY: It's hard to tell. I'm not a mind reader. But we have decades of medical science, randomized controlled studies that show for respiratory viruses, masks do nothing. There's really no - I remain puzzled as to why we keep pushing mask mandates when we have exactly the Hawaii experience, when they put in some of the harshest mandates anywhere in the United States. They saw case numbers jump up by eight to ten times very quickly. I mean what we're seeing is not anymore really a pandemic, we're seeing sort of a casedemic. And you're seeing a lack of acuity. Masks have nothing to do with any of this.\u00a0INGRAHAM: Now Biden also reminded us that the states, Alex, are not going to have much power in his COVID response. Watch.BERENSON: Great.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BIDEN: Uniform national guidelines. We need national guidance as of the basis upon which you can open up. There's no national criteria. What is the national criteria for opening schools? They still don't have one. We have to have this national mandate.(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0INGRAHAM: Alex, this is code for widespread lockdowns, rolling lockdowns, is it not?BERENSON: First of all, I don't know how he thinks he's going to do that.\u00a0Is he going to declare martial law? If the last six months have proved anything and really, I mean it, if the last six months approved anything, it's that there's still a lot of federalism in this country. There is still a lot of power at the state and local level. The White House couldn't get schools open. They genuinely wanted to get schools open in a normal way and they couldn't do it.I want to just add one thing about the masks, because I think it's fascinating, I was just looking up before we came on. You can go back to 1919, more than a century ago. In California, they looked at whether or not masks had done anything. They called them gauze masks then. You can find this online. And the conclusion of an epidemiologist in San Francisco was that masks had made no difference to the course of the epidemic. That was during 1919 and it's true in 2020.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Now Biden is claiming, guys, that he follows the science, only the science. So it was a shock to hear him make this wild prediction.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 Cases and deaths are going to spike this November, and an additional by 215,000 Americans they say are going to die. If there's universal masking, these deaths, projected deaths, could be cut in half.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Dr. Oskoui, first of all, it takes your breath away.\u00a0DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST:\u00a0 It's ridiculous, Laura. The reality is, if I thought Joe Biden was coming up with this stuff on his own and not being given this by his minders, I'd take it as prima facie evidence of mental decline. The reality is he has no scientific basis to say any of this. This virus is dying away through natural herd immunity, and a vaccine may actually be moot. But where the science is, believe me, he'll never be able to produce any reliable sources except the journal of irreproducible results. It's absurd.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Alex, we hear this phrase, well, we can get back to some semblance of normalcy when. But the goal posts are always moving. Really quick, close it out for us.\u00a0BERENSON:\u00a0 Sure. First of all, Biden is talking about models, University of Washington models, and those people have been wrong since March, and they continue to be wrong to this day. If an asteroid hits the earth in December, a million people might die. That's about as likely as what he is predicting right now.\u00a0If you look -- the reason that this post-November prediction is being made is because it's unfalsifiable before the election. Right now, cases are down, hospitalizations are down, deaths are down. So the people who have been trying to panic the country for six months have to point to something that they won't be able to falsify before the election.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 They're running out of time here. Gentleman, thank you so much.\u00a0Great seeing you both tonight.And coming up, before he told Americans he would take away their freedom, Biden left the basement for Florida this week. Raymond Arroyo breaks it all down. It was a sobering visit. And what the voters of Florida told him about the race. \"Seen and Unseen\" next.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose the stories behind the headlines. Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor, author of the forthcoming cook, \"The Spider Who Saved Christmas.\"\u00a0All right, Raymond, Biden made a big Florida push with not such great results the other day. And you spoke to some voters in the state.\u00a0RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 I did. Biden's first event, Laura, was a roundtable with exactly six veterans in Tampa, Florida. He attempted to libel Trump with that discredited \"Atlantic\" story, then he freelanced about employment opportunities for veterans, I think.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 Because if you could take care -- if you were a quartermaster, you can sure as hell take care of running a department store thing -- where -- and a second floor of the ladies department. You know what I mean?\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:\u00a0 I'm not sure anyone knows what he means. This event could not have been more bizarre, Laura. And if you're trying to win over vets, it's best not to portray them and our returning heroes as homicidal killers, as Biden did in this unscripted moment. Listen.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 There was a Marine veterans that had been deployed a total of six times if my memory is correct. I saw a woman walking a dog, ran over her, killed her, killed the dog, put her in the back of his pickup, took her down to I-95 right by where the -- where there was the -- all sandpile for emergencies, molested her, put her back in the truck, came home.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 What an uplifting --\u00a0\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Laura, the veterans I spoke to --\u00a0\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 No, no. What an uplifting story that is. Did he actually say if my memory serves me correct? I think we know that is not the case.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Well, veterans are deeply offended by this that I spoke to today.\u00a0He's basically saying after a long deployment, you come home and kill people. This is unbelievable. So it's so inappropriate. If you're trying to win over veterans, it's just wrong, in my event.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 The throngs of six that were attending that.\u00a0According to the NBC-Marist poll, Biden is trailing Trump by four points now among Hispanics in Florida. So he tried this routine at a Hispanic heritage month event.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 I just have one thing to say. Hang on here.\u00a0\u00a0(MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 There you go. Dance a little bit, Joe. Come on.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:\u00a0 Laura, \"Livin La Vida Loca\" would have been more appropriate, I think. This song is \"Despacito,\" which mean \"slowly.\" And given Biden's history, this is a weird song choice. The lyrics say \"Slowly I want to breathe you neck slowly. Let me murmur things in your ear. I want to see your hair dance.\" This are not images you want to conjure up in Hispanic voters when Joe Biden is around, OK.\u00a0Laura, I spoke to some voters in Boca Raton the other day to see how all of this is playing, despacito.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO:\u00a0 Who are you leaning toward in this election and why?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 President Donald Trump. He's put through everything that he has said that he is going to do. Our economy is fabulous. I'm living in Florida because of that economy. And he's trustworthy.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 I am voting for Biden-Harris.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 OK.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Because Bernie Sanders isn't on the ticket. I wish we had more options. But I believe we need to get the current sitting president out of office because of Supreme Court nominations, because of climate change. I've owned many small businesses here in Boca Raton, and we need to support small businesses.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 And you believe Biden will be better for small business? He's promised to raise taxes and ensure that Obamacare, which falls on the backs of employees, is fully implemented once more.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Absolutely. If that means more people --\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Does that concern your.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Yes, it does. It's hard on small businesses in that way. It benefits more people in the long run.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 There's no leaning. I've already fallen way over for the president in 2016. So we're all set with that.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 And why?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 He absolutely has delivered on what he promised. He's focused. Tremendous success. Doesn't take -- from anybody. How could you not want him? What do you want, a senile old man walking around that doesn't know whether he's asleep or awake?\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Joe Biden is making an empathy play. That is really targeted toward women. Does that empathy play work for you?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 No, it does not.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 Why not?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Because he really doesn't empathize. I don't believe him. I don't believe a word he says. I think everything he says is completely scripted.\u00a0All of my women friends are voting for Donald Trump, every single one of them. And I have a lot of women friends.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Well, it's a tight race in Florida, Raymond.\u00a0ARROYO:\u00a0 It is indeed.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 The one guy looks like he came right from the Bronx and came right down to Florida.\u00a0(LAUGHTER)ARROYO:\u00a0 Well, there are a lot of New York transplants. And you know what, they told me, they like Trump's strength, they like the economic resilience, and strength in security. Safety is a big issue for these Floridians.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 All right, Raymond, thanks so much. Great work. We'll have more from Florida on Friday.\u00a0And the Black Lives Matter movement has seen its popularity plummet in the\u00a0past few months. So what has caused that? Candace Owens chimes in, next.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 In the last 24 hours in Philadelphia, we've seen the depravity of Black Lives Matter movement, and it's reared its ugly head. They've hurled obscenities at police and, of course, Trump supporters.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Why? Why? I said -- why?\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 -- racist dirty -- racist dirty -- racist dirty --\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Here we see BLM and anti-Trump protesters kneeling in an active intersection, blocking traffic of law-abiding, productive citizens just trying to actually support their families. And to cap it all off, they harassed a bunch of diners.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 You tired of hearing the truth. You tired of hearing the truth. Yes, you are. Enjoy your privilege.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 With acts like that occurring nearly every night somewhere in the United States, is it any surprise that public support for Black Lives Matter has dropped 12 points since June. Joining me now is Candace Owens, founder of the Blexit movement, author of the new book \"Blackout.\" Candace, will Democrats end up at some point regretting aligning themselves with this group?\u00a0CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINTS USA:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0We're seeing it right now. They have completely overplayed their hand. They gave it too much time. In the beginning, Americans were apprehensive. They weren't sure. Maybe perhaps this race narrative was real. Maybe this was really about police brutality. Maybe this really was America striving towards equality.\u00a0And now the truth is standing in everybody's face. The Black Lives Matter movement is not striving for equality. In fact, they're striving for entitlement. They want special entitlements. They want white people to stop and raise their fists in the air and salute them when they go into the diners as if it's the 1950s. The things that we would see white racists Americans doing in the 1950s we are now seeing Black Lives Matters activists do at cafes towards white people.People are waking up to the fact that this movement is really about Marxism. It's about the undoing of America. What they're trying to do is really sink all of the systems that we have in place. They just want to disrupt. That's all it's about. They want to disrupt, they want to cause hate, and they want to rapidly spread it, and then point the finger somehow at Trump, and say this is only happening because it's Trump's America.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Right. And Candace, this all comes out also when we have a discussion about how to really to help people who are in need, including African-Americans. And school choice, or educational freedom, as we like to call it, is at the heart of this, real school choice. But Biden has never been for it. Watch.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 NEA members have pushed back against what we think are very misguided school reforms, like charter schools. You know how we feel about charter schools. We'd like to know how you feel about charter schools.\u00a0JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 No privately-funded charter school would receive, or private charter school would receive a penny of federal money. None.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 He agrees with the NEA and the AFT on any of these school choice initiatives. They want to kill them off. And if they can use COVID to try to shut down some of these schools, they'll do that, too.\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 Absolutely. And the reason for that is simple. The government wants to raise the children. They like the fact that you're seeing across these inner cities so many kids are failing. It's unbelievable. You saw me talk about this when I testified in Congress a few months ago -- 75 percent of black boys in California cannot pass a basic literacy exam. That is stunning. Everybody should be talking about that. That means the public school system is failing black Americans.\u00a0You have that happening in inner cities. You have it happening in Baltimore where they can't find a single child across five schools that's proficient in reading or mathematics. And yet the Democrat Party says we want to keep these public schools in place. Why? Because they're able to replace hard academics like mathematics, like engineering, with the soft psychological conditioning courses, like \"The 1619 Project.\" They want to tell your kids about race and feelings. And this stuff is not going to get them ahead in the world. In fact, it's going to send them backwards. And that's exactly what the Democrat Party is after, Laura.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Candace, do you believe that these celebrities like LeBron James and Cardi B with her lovely new number one song, \"Filthy, Filthy,\" that they're using their platforms to push a political agenda? Does that affect the African-American psyche in the United States to move the needle further toward Democrats, or are people beginning to tune that all out when they see less money in their pockets?\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 I think that Cardi B and LeBron James, they are responsible for a lot of disruption that we're seeing in this nation. And they do these things unwittingly. I genuinely think that they do not understand the economics behind what they are preaching or the consequences behind what they are preaching.\u00a0And unfortunately, when you have this angry rhetoric, when you have LeBron James saying that we're literally being hunted, when you have Cardi B saying that Trump's America is racist at the same time she's attacking me because I have a white husband. What ends up happening is you're raising a bunch of kids who believe that in this country they can't make it. When they see someone like LeBron James who is building a $100 million mansion in Bel-Air at the moment, say to you that we're literally being hunted, we being black people by white people, it makes them feel helpless and like they need to get up and do something about it. And it leads to these devastating, staggering crime waves that we're seeing, the increase in these inner cities, because they believe that.\u00a0Unfortunately, you're seeing individuals get arrested for things like we saw in Los Angeles County. They'll find one person. He will be arrested.\u00a0But there is an entire ecosystem of people that deserve to serve time.\u00a0Politicians, the media henchman that have perpetuated this idea that black Americans are being hunted and caused all of this corruption that we see today.\u00a0INGRAHAM:\u00a0 And now, Candace -- Candance, I'm sorry to interrupt you. I wish we had an hour with you. But I've got to say, they're teaching young people this.\u00a0OWENS:\u00a0 Yes.INGRAHAM:\u00a0 A school assignment that just came to my attention about, well, this is Black Lives Matter art and we're going to study that, or we're going to -- OK. I guess. But meanwhile, can you -- can all of you kids write a decent paper without your parents writing it for you? I'm talking about white, black. Just the basics. Let's all learn the basics. Candace, come back soon, and thank you so much for your leadership on this.\u00a0And given the president's historic Middle East peace deal, we thought it might be fun to take a look at what some Biden administration officials once said about it, next.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:\u00a0 Four years ago, John Kerry, who would be in line for a top Biden administration post, offered this as the prospect of a Middle East peace deal.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:\u00a0 There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world. I want to make that very clear to all of you. There will be no advanced and separate peace with the Arab world without the Palestinian process and the Palestinian peace.\u00a0Everybody needs to understand that. That is a hard reality.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, that aged about as well as a bad face lift. Maybe that Vietnam testimony he gave all those years ago -- didn't he say Genghis Khan (ph)?\u00a0That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team take it all from here.\u00a0Shannon?\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

BET founder Robert Johnson, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News, blasted those who are toppling Confederate and other statues across the nation as \"borderline anarchists\" -- while challenging the notion that black Americans support this. People tearing down statues \"have the mistaken assumption that black people are sitting around cheering for them saying\u00a0'Oh, my God, look at these white people. They're doing something so important to us.\u00a0They're\u00a0taking down the statue of a Civil War general who fought for the South,\" Johnson said. \"You know, black people, in my opinion, black people laugh at white people who do this the same way we laugh at white people who say we got to take off the TV shows.\" TRUMP TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER PROTECTING FEDERAL STATUES, MONUMENTS Johnson, who became the country's first black billionaire in 2001, has made a $14 trillion pitch for reparations to descendants of slavery. But he said the\u00a0movement to take down statues, cancel TV shows\u00a0and fire professors does nothing to close the wealth gap that has persisted since slavery. It's \"tantamount to\u00a0rearranging the deck chairs on a racial Titanic,\" Johnson told Fox News. \"It absolutely means nothing.\" Johnson argued that the statue destruction that has swept the nation is meaningless to black Americans who could benefit much more from structural changes like economic equality. \u201cLook, the people who are basically tearing down statues, trying to make a statement are basically borderline anarchists, the way I look at it. They really have no agenda other than the idea we're going to topple a statue,\" Johnson said. \"It's not going to give a kid whose parents can't afford college money to go to college. It's not going to close the labor gap between what white workers are paid and what black workers are paid. And it's not going to take people off welfare or food stamps.\u201d FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO ULYSSES S. GRANT: STATUES, MONUMENTS VANDALIZED EXTEND BEYOND CONFEDERATES Johnson rejected the backlash against public figures who say \"all lives matter\" instead of \"black lives matter,\" and the cancel craze targeting TV shows like \"Dukes of Hazzard\" and movie classics such as \"Gone with the Wind.\" He also mocked white celebrities for what he described as apologizing for their race in emotional social media speeches. \"You know, that to\u00a0me is the silliest expression of white privilege that exists in this country. The notion that a celebrity could get on a Twitter feed and say, 'oh, my God, I am so sorry that I am white.\u2019 I don't find any black people getting on Twitter and saying, 'Oh, I'm so sorry I'm black.' And we got the worst problems. ...\u00a0My thing is: embrace\u00a0being white and do the right thing.\" Johnson suggested white Americans need to ask black Americans what they really want.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is The Story\u00a0tonight. Moments away now from President Trump arriving in Bemidji,\u00a0Minnesota. See, the crowd gathering there, as I pointed out. Pretty good-sized crowd out there at the airport. He should be landing shortly. Vice\u00a0President Joe Biden was in Duluth, Minnesota today. This was his first trip\u00a0to the state since 2017.\u00a0President has been there four times since taking office. Biden went to\u00a0Duluth in the Iron Range area of Minnesota. Now this is a region that\u00a0Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Here's what he had to say this afternoon.\n\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: How many people across the Iron Range?\u00a0How many empty chairs around those dinner tables? Because of his negligence\u00a0and selfishness. How many lies said, and lives lost?\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: In fact, no Republican has won Minnesota since 1972. But\u00a0President Trump worked hard to win them over. Opening up mining projects\u00a0that were banned by President Obama in the area and giving aid to farmers\u00a0strapped by the trade imbalance. Now he seeks a big turnout in the rural\u00a0vote, and he has secured the support of nine Democrat mayors in the Iron\u00a0Range area. There you see Air Force One landing on the tarmac there.\u00a0So, the suburbs - in the suburbs though in 2018, there were two Trump\u00a0districts that turned blue in 2018. So, as you can see this is shaping up\u00a0to be a pretty fierce battle for Minnesota. Minnesota of course is also\u00a0ground zero in the fight over police brutality after George Floyd died in\u00a0Minneapolis triggering months of protests and violence that still grips the\u00a0country. Homicides are up 90 percent in Minneapolis. And arson is up 80\u00a0percent from 2019.\u00a0It was in Minnesota that the City Council began the defund the police\u00a0movement. Remember this from city council president in Minneapolis Lisa\u00a0Bender in June - in May.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What if in the middle of the night my home is broken\u00a0into, who do I call.\n\u00a0LISA BENDER, MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT: That comes from a place of\u00a0privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think\u00a0we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in\u00a0that reality where calling the police may mean more harm is done\n\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: Now in an ironic and sad and some might say pathetic turn around\u00a0those same council members including Bender are now crying out for the\u00a0police to keep them and everyone else safe after vilifying the police force\u00a0for months.\n\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BENDER: And we have officers on the street telling people that they're not\u00a0enforcing crime, what do we do?\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: What do we do. So, in moments former Minnesota Vikings player\u00a0Jack Brewer who lived in Minneapolis for 10 years has businesses there and\u00a0family there as well. He joins us. And Senior Fellow of the New Leaders\u00a0Council Richard Fowler joins us as well.\n\u00a0But we begin tonight with Brian Peters, the Executive Director of the\u00a0Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association. Mr. Peters, thank you so\u00a0much for being here.\u00a0BRIAN PETERS, MINNESOTA POLICE & PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION: Good evening.\u00a0MACCALLUM: You know you listen to Lisa Bender there. She was talking about\u00a0how it's just your white privilege that makes you expect police officers to\u00a0show up in middle of the night. Now she would like to know where the heck\u00a0the police officers are and why crime is escalating so dramatically, sir.\n\u00a0PETERS: Yes. The city council and the mayor are absolutely delusional. They\u00a0have no concept of reality what is happening every day on the streets. And\u00a0what I would challenge them to do instead of naming a street after Mr.\u00a0Floyd, how about getting in a squad car, and seeing what is happening day-after-day on the streets. How about going to the family of Andre Connolly,\u00a0a 17-year-old who was shot dead in North Minneapolis at 4:30 in the\u00a0afternoon. How about going and visiting that family and explain to them why\u00a0their child is dead. They have absolutely no idea what is happening in that\u00a0city right now. And the citizens and the businesses are being absolutely\u00a0lied to.\u00a0MACCALLUM: So, speaking of businesses, this is up from a small business\u00a0owner in Minneapolis who reached out to the precinct in his region, in his\u00a0district for help. And this is the email that he got back from the third\u00a0precinct inspector - excuse me, Sean McGinty.\u00a0As far as a long-term plan, I don't have one. I have lost 30 percent of my\u00a0street officers since the end of May. A potential cadet class stated for\u00a0January of 2020 was also eliminated. Reinforcements aren't coming any time\u00a0soon. We are doing everything we can with what we have. What kind of exodus\u00a0is this producing both in the police precincts and also in the\u00a0neighborhoods, sir?\n\u00a0PETERS: Well, in any police department, you're always going to have\u00a0retirements every year. And what we're seeing in Minneapolis is people are\u00a0leaving, they're fed up, they're leaving in droves. And as the inspector\u00a0pointed out, they've already canceled the cadet class. They've canceled the\u00a0class that was supposed to start in 2021 and it takes about a year to get\u00a0an officer on the street.\u00a0So, if you're losing 150 to 200 officers, where are the replacements.\u00a0Again, I go back to - this is an absolute failure of leadership at the city\u00a0level to realize what they're up against. And the problem is only going to\u00a0get worse and you pointed the crime. The crime is through the roof, but\u00a0nobody is talking about it. The mainstream media is not covering it. And\u00a0the streets of Minneapolis are starting to look like a war zone.\u00a0I was just downtown earlier this week. You have businesses that are boarded\u00a0up. Nobody is there. And again, nobody is talking about the reality of what\u00a0is happening with crime and what is happening at a staffing level at the\u00a0Minneapolis Police Department. It's absolutely sad. And again, the city\u00a0council and the mayor just don't have a clue.\n\u00a0MACCALLUM: Mr. Peters, thank you. We're talking about it and we know a lot\u00a0of people are very interested in what's going on in all of our cities. We\u00a0thank you, sir, for being here tonight.\u00a0So, as we await President Trump to take the stage, we can all see that Air\u00a0Force One is there. They're bringing the steps up to the side of the plane\u00a0right now. Jack Brewer is with us, former Minnesota Viking and CEO of the\u00a0Brewer Group, and Richard Fowler, Senior Fellow at the New Leaders Council,\u00a0and a Fox News Contributor. Great to have both of you with us tonight. I\u00a0want to bring up first this video that I think was a real turning point in\u00a0this story. And this video shows the police cars leaving the third precinct\u00a0in Minneapolis, exiting, abandoning ship, leaving their precinct.\u00a0And after that, the windows were broken, people flooded in there. And\u00a0Richard, I think that was a real turning point. I think that after that, we\u00a0saw such a dissolution of so many of these police departments and the\u00a0feeling of safety and so many of our cities. I mean, what do you say when\u00a0you go back to that moment, given what you're now hearing and watching and\u00a0seeing in Minneapolis?\n\u00a0RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, thanks for having me, Martha. I\u00a0think that the truth of the matter here is what needs to happen now more\u00a0than any time before is everybody needs to come to the table and figure out\u00a0how do we create a meaningful solution to deal with the fact that there's a\u00a0breakdown in trust in communities of color when it comes to policing. And\u00a0now police are feeling this sort of pressure of how am I able to do my job?\u00a0I think the place where you see this happening most poignantly is in\u00a0Louisville, right. The Breanna Taylor family and what they did in that\u00a0settlement was actually quite powerful. And it was actually something that\u00a0we should all aspire to. They brought all the parties to the table and they\u00a0said, how can we make this better? So, now cops not only have to wear body\u00a0cameras, they're forced to turn them on. They're hiring more mental health\u00a0care professionals. So, when their mental health calls, there's actually\u00a0somebody who's who spends years and years training on how to de-escalate\u00a0those situations. On top of that, they're incentivizing police to live in\u00a0the communities where they work, all steps to work on pushing that reset\u00a0button--MACCALLUM: But Richard--FOWLER: When it comes to how we do policing in there.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I agree with you and we do need to find solutions. There's\u00a0absolutely no doubt about it. But when you look back at what they allowed\u00a0to happen in Minneapolis and other cities across the country, don't you\u00a0look back at that now and say, we vilified all police in a way that was\u00a0destructive to the safety and sanctity of these cities.\n\u00a0FOWLER: Listen, I don't think anybody wants violence in their cities.\u00a0Nobody wants to see windows broken or small businesses shut down. Right.\u00a0But I think you have to remember how we got to many of these conversations,\u00a0right. How we got to this pressure point.\u00a0We got to this pressure point because there's been a long call for police\u00a0reform in this country and that call has gone unanswered. So, peaceful\u00a0protesters took to the streets and demanded that. And folks and\u00a0provocateurs and whatever you want to call them, used those peaceful\u00a0protesters voices and their stage to create havoc in the streets. And that\u00a0has to stop. And it stops by listening to peaceful protesters and working\u00a0on creating meaningful reforms.\n\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes, and Jack Brewer, come on in here, what do you think as you\u00a0look at the city that you love in Minneapolis and the fact that people are\u00a0terrified in those communities of bullets coming through their windows and\u00a0potentially hitting them even in their homes?\n\u00a0JACK BREWER, FORMER MINNESOTA VIKINGS SAFETY: So sad. I mean, this city is\u00a0not normally like this. This is Minneapolis, a place where, it's Minnesota.\u00a0Nice. Everyone loves each other.\u00a0I agree with Richard and I don't agree with a lot of things that he says.\u00a0But I think you've got to look back at where the problem started, and\u00a0you've got to hold some people accountable. Why are we not holding them\u00a0accountable? If this had been Republicans doing this, everyone would be up\u00a0in arms. But no, its Democratic leadership starting from over 17 years.\u00a0When that man kneeled on George Floyd's neck, he had so many violations\u00a0behind him, any of us would have been fired from our jobs.\u00a0But no, the Democratic leadership, the attorney general's offices, even\u00a0Senator Amy Klobuchar, all of them overlooked all of these discrepancies\u00a0through the police department where they were mistreating people of color.\u00a0So, let's start looking at the actual cities, the police chiefs and the\u00a0folks who are really at fault here. And let's start holding folks\u00a0accountable, just like every other American is held accountable in their\u00a0job. These are elected officials and elected officials have a job to do in\u00a0this nation. And we can't just point back at protesters in this and that.\u00a0We have to look at root cause.\u00a0We have root causes across our nation, and they start with spirituality.\u00a0They start with when you go into the same neighborhoods across Minneapolis,\u00a0they're pulling God out of the schools. Yes, fatherlessness that's rising.\u00a0You have a double. The crime rate has double when it comes to murders. The\u00a0crime rate has almost doubled when this comes to shootings. This is\u00a0ridiculous. We have to take a stand in our nation and save our streets and\u00a0get law and order back. But most importantly, get godly order, get the rule\u00a0of law, and get people with the fear of God back in them.\n\u00a0MACCALLUM: Richard, what do you say to that?\n\u00a0FOWLER: Listen, I think Jack brings up some very good points, right? I\u00a0think we do have to have a conversation about how we return law and order\u00a0and law and order is a two-way street. Right. And when a pastor in many\u00a0communities can walk out of his church with a suit on and be treated with\u00a0respect, that same pastor when he has a hoodie on or sweatpants on, is\u00a0treated as a threat. And I'm not making this up because the polling says\u00a0that.\u00a0A recent Gallup poll found that one in five African Americans feel that\u00a0when they interact with police, they're treated with courtesy, respect, and\u00a0dignity. And we've got to turn that around and turning that around starts\u00a0with everybody engaging in the conversation. And that means if it's a\u00a0national problem, where is the Department of Justice? Where is that level\u00a0of oversight coming into these police departments saying your policies and\u00a0practices are not as good as they should be, they're not up to the\u00a0standards of what America should be, they're not up to the standards to\u00a0what law and order should be in this country, which means fair law and fair\u00a0order for everybody. Equally distributed and equally just.\u00a0MACCALLUM: I'm thinking back to the comments, Jack whereby Attorney General\u00a0Bill Barr this week talking about the number of unarmed African American\u00a0men per year who are killed in these interactions with police officers. And\u00a0we all want that number to be zero. He said, it's closer to 12.\u00a0But the reality is that the other huge issue that we're seeing in these\u00a0cities is black-on-black crime and children. There are three teenagers that\u00a0were killed in recent weeks in Minneapolis. So, I think we need to have the\u00a0broader conversation and to understand that that when black lives matter,\u00a0those black lives need to matter, too. And everyone needs to bring that\u00a0part of the conversation into what we're discussing here in terms of\u00a0solutions, do they not?\n\u00a0BREWER: We have to, they're not mutually exclusive. We cannot continue as a\u00a0nation to pick the few police officers that are bad apples. Let's get rid\u00a0of them and let's hold them accountable. But at the same time, you can't\u00a0expect police to go into these communities where we have war in the\u00a0streets, where you have hundreds of black men shooting at each other every\u00a0weekend. There has to be some accountability there, too. And we can't keep\u00a0these things mutually exclusive. We have to have the broad conversation and\u00a0talk about the root cause. And the root cause is fatherlessness. I keep\u00a0saying it.\u00a0You're 20 times more likely to go to prison and have a run in with the law\u00a0enforcement if you're fatherless. The people we see, the reason why these\u00a0police officers are scared and people like myself don't want to be police\u00a0officers. And most people who have something to say, most pundits don't\u00a0want to go into these same streets and police them.\u00a0And I'm a black man. I have black kids. And, yes, I wear baseball caps and\u00a0I wear sweats and everything else, too. But when a police officer pulls me\u00a0over, I don't talk smack to them. I say, Yes, sir, no, sir. And I respect\u00a0authority. These are the same things that are happening in our schools. We\u00a0have kids that don't respect their teachers because we put fathers out of\u00a0the homes and we've we did everything we can to water down masculinity\u00a0across America. We need to get Jesus Christ back into our schools, back\u00a0into our society. It's the only thing that can solve our racial divide.\u00a0The Bible doesn't talk about race, that's manmade. This is a spiritual\u00a0battle that we cannot fight with flesh and blood. We need to get back to\u00a0the blood of Jesus and the word of God. And Martha, thanks for having me on\u00a0this show to be able to talk about this, because these issues have come to\u00a0a boiling point in our nation. And I know a lot of Americans agree with me\u00a0right now that we need to do something about this and just talking about it\u00a0is not enough anymore.\n\u00a0FOWLER: Mr. Brewer, I want to push back on something he said there, because\u00a0I was - I'm from a single family, my mom, I had a single mother my whole\u00a0entire life. And she's kept us in church more days, more days than we were\u00a0out in the streets playing. Right.\u00a0BREWER: Amen.\u00a0FOWLER: And I think there's something that I want to push back on there,\u00a0right. Because I think the ideal of the notion that just because I didn't\u00a0have a father in the home, I'm more of a threat to society just seems to me\u00a0to be a little bit flawed.\u00a0BREWER: Richard, but you just said, you had a father. You just said that\u00a0your mom kept you in church, so you have the spiritual father.\u00a0(CROSSTALK)BREWER: And that's the only father that matters. And that's my point.\u00a0FOWLER: Wait a minute, Mr. Brewer.\u00a0BREWER: When you don't have a father in the flesh in the home, you're less\u00a0likely to have a mother. You're lucky--FOWLER: We're talking about taking - you're talking about taking fathers\u00a0out of the home, we have to understand there's a larger systemic problem in\u00a0this country. But to say that because you just have a mother in the home,\u00a0you are more likely to be a threat.\n\u00a0BREWER: That's not what I said.\u00a0MACCALLUM: No, I don't think that's what he was saying. We've got to go.\u00a0Jack Brewer and Richard Fowler - that's right. He's talking about the\u00a0statistics that when you look at the people who commit crimes, the\u00a0statistics are that there is a larger portion of them who did grow up in a\u00a0home without a father. And those statistics prove out. Gentlemen, thank you\u00a0very much. Richard Fowler and Jack Brewer, thank you.\u00a0As you can see, everybody at home, the president is deplaning Air Force One\u00a0and getting ready to speak to the crowd. He lost this state of Minnesota in\u00a02016 by less than two points. Tonight, he is in Beltrami County, which is a\u00a0county that he won. And he hopes, of course, that he will win again. All of\u00a0both candidates hope that they're going to win back the places that were\u00a0won before and to expand. And that's why you saw both candidates, Joe\u00a0Biden, and President Trump, in the state today.\u00a0President Trump. Look at that from 2016. So basically, every single one of\u00a0those rural counties was red, but he lost the state, the population centers\u00a0obviously, Minneapolis, St. Paul. And then you've got that northeastern\u00a0area, which is the Iron Range section of Minneapolis, which is such a huge\u00a0focus of this part of the election when you look at Minneapolis.\u00a0So, he's vowing to make the country, the manufacturing superpower of the\u00a0world, to open up mining in that area, to end reliance on China. As I said,\u00a0Joe Biden was also in the state today as they try to drum up support there.\u00a0And here's how the vice president spent his time today and here's what he\u00a0talked about. Watch this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0BIDEN: Hello Minnesota.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: All right, so that that is earlier today. That was Joe Biden as\u00a0he talked to some of the manufacturing folks here in the state of\u00a0Minnesota. I'm joined now by White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro, who\u00a0joins me now. Peter, good to have you with us.\n\u00a0You know, when the former vice president spoke with Anderson Cooper, he\u00a0talked about China and he said that he saw China as a competitor and not as\u00a0an opponent. I think China is probably the - we do have that sound now,\u00a0let's play that and then we'll get your reaction to it, sir. Hang on.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Do you view China as an opponent, because the\u00a0president says you've been too cozy with China, too accepting of them in\u00a0the international community.\u00a0BIDEN: I'm not the guy. Look, China, we now have a larger trade deficit\u00a0with China than we've ever had with China.\u00a0COOPER: Do you view China as an opponent.\u00a0BIDEN: I view China kind of as a competitor, a serious competitor. That's\u00a0why I think we have to strengthen our relationships and our alliances in\u00a0Asia.\n\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0MACCALLUM: All right. Peter Navarro, a competitor or opponent or enemy,\u00a0what's your word?\n\u00a0PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: Let's do a fact check first.\u00a0First, our trade deficit since 2018 has been going down with China because\u00a0of Donald Trump. Of course, they're an enemy. This is Joe Biden as his\u00a0worst. Couple of months ago, he's saying, don't worry, they can't eat our\u00a0lunch. Come on, man. I find it interesting that he was actually in the\u00a0Mesabi Iron Range. I didn't know. I didn't think he knew where it was.\u00a0But let me tell you, Martha, why Donald Trump is going to win this state.\u00a0The steel and aluminum tariffs, which Joe Biden opposes, basically have a\u00a0renaissance in the Mesabi Iron Range. I've stood on the docks in Duluth\u00a0seeing the taconite pellets go on the boats to the Great Lakes, out to the\u00a0steel mills. And what Donald Trump is going to do is also turn that into\u00a0the copper range, the nickel range, the palladium range, the cobalt range.\u00a0He's going to make logging great again in that state. And you're going to\u00a0see that whole eastern part of Minnesota go strongly for Trump. In\u00a0Minneapolis, you've got 3M making all our N-95 masks and you've got the\u00a0USMCA helping farmers in Minnesota and Jack Brewer for mayor, by the way.\u00a0MACCALLUM: We look at the polling. We know what happened in Minnesota. We\u00a0just broke it down a little bit last time around. The president got, I\u00a0think, 350,000 more votes in Minnesota last time around. Then President\u00a0Bush got, and they have about 3 million voter contacts between Dornoch and\u00a0InterAction's on the ground from the Trump team. And the president is there\u00a0tonight. We're going to listen in, and we'll dip in and out of this. But,\u00a0Peter, stand by if you would. Here's the president.\u00a0DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Thank you. Well, I just\u00a0want to say hello, Minnesota, we love you, Minnesota, you're great. We're\u00a0going to win Minnesota because they did nothing for Minnesota except close\u00a0up that beautiful iron ore territory, they closed it up with a pen. Do you\u00a0remember that one day, you didn't have your jobs? Then I came along, and I\u00a0opened it up. So that's critical.\n\u00a0But I'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people\u00a0of this incredible state. You're really hardworking American patriots that\u00a0what you are. And a lot of people haven't been treated right until I came\u00a0along, and we've done a lot of work and a lot of good work. And you had\u00a0your best year ever last year. The state had the best year.\n\u00a046 days from now, we're going to win Minnesota and we're going to win four\u00a0more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this\u00a0election is the subject of refugees, you know it, you know it perhaps\u00a0better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You're having a good time with\u00a0the refugees? That's good. We want to have Omar. He said, Omar, that's a\u00a0beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win?\n\u00a0It's unbelievable, every family in Minnesota needs to know about Sleepy Joe\u00a0Biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from\u00a0Somalia, from other places all over the planet. That's what's happened, and\u00a0you like Omar, don't you?\u00a0Biden has promised a 700 percent increase in the manifesto with Bernie,\u00a0right? A 700 percent increase in the importation of refugees from the most\u00a0dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia.\u00a0Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700 percent increase. Good luck, Minnesota.\u00a0Enjoy yourselves. Because if I'm not here, if I don't win, I don't know\u00a0where I'm going to be. But maybe I'll come over to see, Mike. I'll come and\u00a0see, Mike.\u00a0Your state will be overrun and destroyed if Biden and the radical Left win.\u00a0That's what's going to happen. I've been watching it for years. They\u00a0haven't treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank\u00a0you. I'll tell you; these hangars are great.\n\u00a0Remember this, it's a friendly protest, please remember, this is not a\u00a0rally. You're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You're not\u00a0allowed to go to church. You're not allowed to do anything. The only thing\u00a0you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down\u00a0storefronts, blow up stores and kill people because that's considered a\u00a0protest. And yet they allow you to have - you don't have to wear masks at\u00a0protest. So, I said, we can't have a rally. The most we can have is 10\u00a0people. But why don't we just go on a protest? Because this is a protest.\n\u00a0It's a protest against stupidity. And speaking about stupidity, Sleepy Joe\u00a0will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp, think of it, 700 percent increase.\u00a0So, you're not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He's not too\u00a0thrilled when he hears this. 700 percent increase is what they have in the\u00a0manifesto, now maybe they don't honor it. But I would say they'll go\u00a0substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children's\u00a0schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. It'll\u00a0happen.\n\u00a0Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban. Jihadist regions,\u00a0Jihadist regions. They've already been doing that to you, haven't they?\u00a0Opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administration is\u00a0keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country.\u00a0We don't want them. We've got enough of them. We've got enough of them.\u00a0Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals\u00a0charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault,\u00a0robbery, terrorism, and murder of course. These hardened criminals are back\u00a0in their country where they can do all the complaining they want. And your\u00a0children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you.\n\u00a0If it were up to Biden, and it's not it's the people that surround him,\u00a0they are seriously radical Left Democrats and they're very dangerous and\u00a0the offenders are very dangerous. And they'd be running all over your state\u00a0only by voting for me. Are you going to say, but I hate to say this? I did\u00a0it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and I'll do it for\u00a0you again. I'll do it for you again, but if you vote for me, I'm the\u00a0difference and I'm the wall, you know the wall that we're building on the\u00a0southern border. I'm your wall between the American dream and chaos.\u00a0Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the Left-wing mob. He has no\u00a0clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago, I said to a certain\u00a0senator who I was very friendly with a Democrat who is the dumbest senator,\u00a0who's the smartest senator? He gave me a name for the smartest. I said,\u00a0who's the dumbest? Joe Biden. You didn't know that? That was 25 years ago.\u00a0That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for Sleepy Joe.\n\u00a0And they do disinformation, they make things up and they make commercials,\u00a0they make things up, I've never seen anything like it. Everything they make\u00a0up. First of all, I'm the one protecting your Social Security. They say\u00a0Trump, remember four years ago, they used to say, Trump will get rid of\u00a0social, I have protected your Social Security. They're going to destroy\u00a0your Social Security. Another thing, Big Ten football, did I do a good job?\n\u00a0Your team better do well, you're on the spot. They better do well. Are\u00a0they're going to do well this year? I think so, right. And I brought it\u00a0back, but I saw that, you know, what I did it actually, it sort of\u00a0energized me. Sleepy Joe did it that I was against football, that I was\u00a0against Big Ten football. Give me a break. I was against it. When I saw the\u00a0ad, I said, what's the problem with Big Ten football? They said they're not\u00a0going to open, why? And they say some stupid reason.\n\u00a0I said, these are strong young people. They're going to do great. Let's get\u00a0going. I called the commissioner, Kevin, good guy. And we sort of started\u00a0something and we got it rolling. We had big opposition from a few of the\u00a0Democrat states and governors, but we rolled over the opposition. And you\u00a0have Big Ten football.\u00a0Congratulations,\u00a0congratulations.\u00a0When the Far-Left rioters rampage across Minneapolis and they rampage\u00a0across your state, how about your police department? Let's just run for\u00a0your lives and it's not their fault, they were told to do that. You have a\u00a0good police department, you have good police, but they're not allowed to do\u00a0their job. They're not allowed to do their job.\n\u00a0Remember that, they were told to leave the precinct, leave it, and then\u00a0they knocked the hell out of that precinct, and they had a great mayor,\u00a0great mayor, it's a real power. Remember, did you ever hear of a man,\u00a0Fiorello LaGuardia? Did you ever - I don't think that happened with him.\u00a0New York. I don't think it happened with Rudy Giuliani. Did it? What a\u00a0great job. Rudy did. You realize, Rudy just now really being appreciated.\u00a0People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great man.\n\u00a0Joe Biden called the peaceful protesters. He said these are peaceful\u00a0protesters as opposed to sending in the National Guard, they didn't want\u00a0the National Guard, Joe Biden said you shouldn't send the National Guard\u00a0and this went on day after day after day.\u00a0I pushed and I got it approved. The National Guard and it ended within what\u00a0would you say, a half-hour?\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: It was about half an hour. You wouldn't have Minneapolis. You better\u00a0remember this when you go and vote. And your voting starts tonight, please.(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: You'd be saying, do you remember when we had a city called\u00a0Minneapolis? Do you remember? It used to be over there, it's all ashes now.\u00a0That place was coming down. That was -- you didn't have anything. But\u00a0wasn't that a beautiful sight?\u00a0Look, all of a sudden, you saw one guy in a black uniform, then another,\u00a0then another, then another on the street. Remember that street, loaded up\u00a0with CNN reporters, remember Alie Velshi -- shaved head, nice hair, shaved\u00a0head, some people said I should do that. Shave the head just get it up.\u00a0Can't do it.Now we polled it, I'd go down about 22 points. We polled it. They want to\u00a0poll everything nowadays. I don't believe in polls. They poll everything.\u00a0But Alie Velshi, I don't know anything about the guy but I, you know, I\u00a0know he was standing there, this is really quiet a good scene, it's a\u00a0friendly protest, everyone is acting and behind him, the entire city was\u00a0burning. It was like black, it's one of the great pictures of all time.\u00a0The entire city was burning down, that was your city. And it's a shame it\u00a0took so long but the governor finally did it at least. You know, if you\u00a0take a look at Portland, the governor can't quite do it, she can't get\u00a0there, I speak to her all the time. Come on, governor. I can straighten out\u00a0Portland, give me less than an hour. Just let us have it for, you know,\u00a0because we have to get, the state has to ask for it, they have to request.\u00a0It's such a shame. It's such a shame. But in your case, we went. And all of\u00a0a sudden, it was really, that was going to be a bad night, too. Right?\u00a0Remember that? About seven o'clock, then they see this guy walk out with\u00a0about a $250,000 outfit on, that's because they had more computers and this\u00a0and that, got the tear gas deal, he's got the whole deal. Pepper spray, got\u00a0everything. The finest outfit you can buy, believe me. We just paid for him\u00a0and they'll very expensive.\u00a0So, we see one, the helmet, how about the helmet with the goggles, you can\u00a0see at night, you can see in day, you can see whenever the hell you want.\u00a0So, there's one, I said, that's only one guy. Then you said, no, they're\u00a0three, then four, then you see another 10, just getting out of the buses,\u00a0coming from very friendly territory.\u00a0And then you have a line and they were very tight together, there was no\u00a0social distancing at all which we're going to have to speak to them about\u00a0that. No, they were touching.\u00a0(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Sure, they were touching, right? So, you had the first one. And then\u00a0you had the second, then you had the third one, and then you had a -- and\u00a0then they said march, I remember this guy well. He got hit in the knee with\u00a0a canister of teargas and he went down. He didn't -- he was down. My knee,\u00a0my knee. Nobody cared, these guys didn't care, they moved him aside. And\u00a0they just walk right there. It was like, it was a most beautiful thing.\u00a0No, because after we take all that crap for weeks and weeks that we take\u00a0this crap and then you finally see men get up there and go right through\u00a0them, didn't -- wasn't it a beautiful sight?\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: It's called law and order. Law and order? Portland would be easier\u00a0because it's more confined. We just go being that would be it. But, you\u00a0know, so they had four or five lines then they had lines in different, and\u00a0everybody did the same thing.\u00a0Did they ever even move one step back? I don't think so. Right? It was just\u00a0a slow walk right forward then they started walking faster, faster, faster,\u00a0put a lot of guys in jail, Tom, right? He put a lot of guys. Great\u00a0congressman by the way, he put a lot of guys in jail.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Great. Not good, great. They put a lot of guys in jail that night,\u00a0Tom, and that was the end of it, I don't think you had any problem after\u00a0that. If you had any flareups, we'll send them in again. But that's all you\u00a0do.These are Democrat-run disasters. Look at Chicago, look at Portland, look\u00a0at you with Minneapolis, these are disasters. But the way, they are still\u00a0trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis, that's what I heard.\u00a0See, they never learn. They never learn.They don't -- look at this, I love it you got a lot of people here.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: There's a lot of people. I actually like this, you know, we have the\u00a0arenas, we've always fill them up, it's been great and the arenas are good\u00a0but usually you have to travel like 45 minutes. This thing, you have a\u00a0hanger, the plane becomes your backstop, right, it's like your curtain. You\u00a0know, it's a curtain. You get a free curtain.\u00a0We are outside which actually makes people happy and it even makes the\u00a0people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy because outside is\u00a0better, you know, it's better. And we are rounding the turn on COVID, by\u00a0the way our vaccines are coming. A lot of things --(CROWD CHEERING)\u00a0TRUMP: We're rounding the turn. We've done a great job, we've done a\u00a0phenomenal job, we don't get credit for that but we'll discussed that in a\u00a0minute. But when you look at it, when you look at it, our country is\u00a0amazing, it's an amazing country. We love this country and we're not going\u00a0to let --(CROWD CHEERING)\u00a0TRUMP: -- we're not going to let radical left socialist/communist takeover\u00a0our country. OK?(CROWD CHEERING)TRUMP: They use the word socialist and socialists aren't great but\u00a0communists are a hell of a lot worse and that's where it would be headed.\u00a0And we're standing in the way of them, this group of people, but you have a\u00a0lot of groups of people just like this. Every place we go, last night, you\u00a0know where we were -- you saw that it was all over the place. Right? That's\u00a0a big state, that's a great state and then I see the fake polls.\u00a0You know, I just saw a poll here, Minnesota down nine. I don't think so. I\u00a0mean, I just don't think so.\u00a0(CROWD BOOING)TRUMP: I don't think so. No, they said. I don't think so. Right? I don't\u00a0think so. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.\u00a0(CROWD CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like a (Inaudible).(CROWD CHEERING)\u00a0TRUMP: President Trump is down nine in Minnesota.\u00a0MACCALLUM: This is a Fox News alert. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York.\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died at the age of 87\u00a0due to complications from pancreatic cancer according to the information we\u00a0are getting the court. The court says that Ginsburg was sworn in from -- as\u00a0an associate justice back in 1993, appointed by Bill Clinton. She was the\u00a0second woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\u00a0She is the first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. A New York\u00a0native born in Brooklyn, New York. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she received her\u00a0undergraduate degree from Cornell University, she then received her law\u00a0degrees from Harvard University and Columbia University. She was the first\u00a0female member of the Harvard Law Review and she graduated at the top of her\u00a0class from Columbia.\u00a0She was sworn in as a judge on the U.S. Circuit of Appeals from the\u00a0District of Columbia circuit in 1980 after being nominated by President\u00a0Jimmy Carter. She served until 1993 when she replaced Justice Byron White\u00a0on the Supreme Court. She was nominated for that post by President Bill\u00a0Clinton.\u00a0Justice Ginsburg served more than two decades on the Supreme Court and was\u00a0one of only four women ever appointed to the high court. During her tenure,\u00a0she was a fierce advocate for women's rights.Shannon Bream takes a look back at her long and distinguished career.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUTH BADER GINSBURG, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED\u00a0STATES: I, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, do solemnly swear --(END VIDEO CLIP)SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: She might have seemed small in stature but\u00a0as a second woman to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ruth Bader\u00a0Ginsburg was a trailblazer for women's rights and a champion for civil\u00a0liberties.Ginsburg was born Ruth Joan Bader on March 15th, 1933 in a working-class\u00a0neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The daughter of Nathan and Celia Bader.\u00a0Ginsburg's mother died when she was just 17, the day before she graduated\u00a0from high school.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GINSBURG: It was one of the most trying times in my life but I knew that\u00a0she wanted me to study hard and get good grades and succeed in life. So,\u00a0that's what I did.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: She finished first in her class at Cornell where she met and married\u00a0Martin Ginsburg, an aspiring lawyer and, quote, \"the first boy I dated who\u00a0cared that I had a brain.\" Like her husband, Ginsburg pursued a law degree\u00a0enrolling in Harvard after the birth of daughter Jane, then at Columbia Law\u00a0School where she graduated of the top of her class.\u00a0She stayed in the world of academia and while a professor at Rutgers\u00a0University, she gave birth to a son James. But she soon left Rutgers for\u00a0Columbia University to become that school's first female tenured law\u00a0professor. She described the 1970s as a fruitful time for women's rights.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GINSBURG: I was fantastically happy to be born when I was, and to be in the\u00a0right place to help advance this movement for women's equality.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: She went on to create the American Civil Liberties Union Women's\u00a0Rights Project and as general counsel for the ACLU, Ginsburg began\u00a0appearing before the Supreme Court. She argued six cases for women's rights\u00a0before President Jimmy Carter nominated her to serve on the U.S. Court of\u00a0Appeals for the D.C. circuit.\u00a0Then in 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated her to the nation's highest\u00a0court.

While she never claimed to have a\u00a0favorite opinion.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GINSBURG: My favorite opinion when it's a little bit like asking me which\u00a0of my four grandchildren.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: Ginsburg said the ruling in the Virginia Military Institute case\u00a0which prohibited the state from operating an all-male institution with\u00a0taxpayer dollars gave her tremendous satisfaction.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GINSBURG: That was a very satisfying opinion for me to write.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: And her dissent in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire was a precursor for\u00a0the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which Congress passed into law in 2009 to\u00a0address the perceived pay gap between men and women. But she suffered\u00a0losses too. In an interview with New Republic, she said if she could\u00a0overrule one decision it would be the 2010 Citizens United ruling that\u00a0allowed corporations and unions to financially support candidates running\u00a0for office.\u00a0Ginsburg said, quote, \"I think the notion that we have all the democracy\u00a0that money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to be,\u00a0so that's number one on my list.\"\u00a0In her personal life, Ginsburg battled four separate cancer diagnoses. In\u00a01999 it was colon cancer, a decade later, pancreatic cancer.

That's -- that's I think\u00a0something I witnessed in my own life span.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: And throughout her life, she remained an optimist.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0GINSBURG: We still have a way to go to ensure that all people in our land\u00a0enjoy the equal protection of the laws but considering how far we have\u00a0come, there is good cause for optimism about our country's future.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Ruth Bader Ginsburg dead tonight at the age of 87.\u00a0Shannon Bream host of Fox News at night who put together that piece for us\u00a0joins me now. Shannon, obviously, she has had so many health challenges\u00a0over the years, but she has been such a fighter, and such a courageous\u00a0member of this court showing up in the middle of all of those procedures\u00a0and doing her best to live her life as a justice to the very end. Your\u00a0thoughts on this obviously very big news story on so many angles tonight.\u00a0BREAM: Yes, it's shocking, any time that we get news that one of the\u00a0justices has been passed away, we have been through so many roller coasters\u00a0with her following, as you said, so many challenges to her health over the\u00a0years and she has fought back and been so incredibly strong.\u00a0I remember being struck by the death of her husband. They were extremely\u00a0close. And just devoted to each other and when he passed away a few years\u00a0ago, I was in court the next day and I was stunned to see her there. But\u00a0she was so devoted to the court, to her job there, to her life's work\u00a0there. She was dedicated and she was not going to let anything stop her.\u00a0She had long said when people would nudge her or push her into retirement\u00a0and try to suggest she would say nope, as long as I feel like I can do this\u00a0job mentally and physically, I'm going to keep doing this job and that's\u00a0what she did years and years and years.\u00a0She was the second female appointed to the Supreme Court. She has had such\u00a0an enormous impact, it's hard to overstate it at this point. It is a shock\u00a0tonight because she has overcome so much in her life and been so incredibly\u00a0strong. And she's had prayers from around the world, as she has gone public\u00a0and she is one of the justices who has been very open and honest with us.\u00a0As member of the press corps covering the Supreme Court, each time that she\u00a0was hospitalized or had an issue, she wasn't somebody that tried to hide it\u00a0from us. She was public in sharing these different struggles that she had.\u00a0And so, we knew a lot of what was going on, there was a lot of talk with\u00a0her last time with the recurrence of cancer about her ability to continue\u00a0to fight. And she had said she was undergoing chemo and that was going\u00a0well. This was just a matter of weeks ago, she felt hopeful about that.\u00a0So obviously in these last few days and weeks, she did privately come to\u00a0terms, I can only assume, and with her family about the fact -- you know,\u00a0the fact that her life was coming to a close, we're told she was surrounded\u00a0by her family tonight, they were with her. She's got two children and\u00a0several grandchildren, and she was incredibly devoted to them too, and so\u00a0very, very proud of them.\u00a0She just spoke glowing of her family and she had shared over the years\u00a0about what it was like to be a young woman in law school. During the time\u00a0that she was in law school and how she was expected to juggle things with a\u00a0husband and with children eventually and that she was treated differently\u00a0in those days when she was coming out of school, one of the top graduates.\u00a0And yet, being viewed by some employers as somebody who might be a\u00a0liability because she was a woman who valued her family, her marriage, and\u00a0her kids and she blazed a path. And she was somebody who showed us that you\u00a0could be incredibly committed to your professional life, to fighting fights\u00a0that to her were exceptionally important and to raising a family as well.\u00a0So, it is a shock to the system tonight because she has done so well in\u00a0rallying so many past, you know, past difficulties but we know that, we're\u00a0told she was at peace with her family. And that is the news tonight, at 87\u00a0years old that she has passed away.\u00a0MACCALLUM: What a remarkable life. And as you point out so perfectly,\u00a0Shannon, she really had it all. I mean, she's a woman who had it all. She\u00a0was extremely successful, Ivy League education and her law education, and\u00a0she worked through all of that while, you know, raising her family over the\u00a0course of those years.\u00a0And then as you say, being so, you know, she struck such a great balance, I\u00a0think, in terms of being human and also being this great legal mind and\u00a0someone that so many people looked up to. And the other thing that I think\u00a0of when you mentioned in your piece, that she shared her love of opera with\u00a0Antonin Scalia is that the camaraderie on the court and how well respected\u00a0she was by all of the members of the court.\u00a0And obviously they had differences in the way they approach the\u00a0Constitution and approach these cases but she was part of that family. She\u00a0was a pillar of that family.\u00a0BREAM: Yes. And there's really, you know, we talked to the justices and you\u00a0know -- the truth is that nobody understands what their life is like except\u00a0for those who have served on that bench. Nine at a time that they do become\u00a0like family.\u00a0There was so much discussion of her relationship with the late Justice\u00a0Scalia. Also, one of those nights the shocking news that we got that he was\u00a0gone that they had such a friendship, that they bonded over all kinds of\u00a0different things. They enjoy spending time together. They are families\u00a0together.\u00a0They could not have been more opposed on, as you said, the way that they\u00a0viewed interpretation of the Constitution and many of the key critical\u00a0decisions that came down from the court, and yet, in the midst of that they\u00a0were able to forge this very genuine, very close friendship over things\u00a0that they did have in common.\u00a0And you know, the justices have lunch together on a regular basis and one\u00a0of the things is, they don't talk politics, they don't talk about the\u00a0cases, they talk about their grandkids and opera and travel and the things\u00a0that do bond them.\u00a0And a lot of people saw the two of them as an odd couple. They made no\u00a0apologies for it, they were very close and it was a beautiful thing to see\u00a0that you could be so opposed ideologically on a number of key issues and\u00a0yet, have a genuine affection and love for each other.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, you have captured her life in such a great way,\u00a0and obviously, you know, moments away the discussion will turn to what\u00a0happens now. But I just want to give this moment to Justice Ginsburg, to\u00a0her legacy, to her incredible life, and to her family that she leaves\u00a0behind as we all send condolences to the offspring of this remarkable,\u00a0remarkable life.And thank you, Shannon, so much for doing such a beautiful job documenting\u00a0it, and obviously your close coverage of the Supreme Court and\u00a0understanding of all of its workings is a huge value to us tonight.\u00a0I know we're going to hear a lot more from you as we continue through the\u00a0process of this very big development tonight. Shannon, I thank you so much\u00a0for being with us.\u00a0We are going to return our local Fox stations to their regular programming,\u00a0please tune in to Fox News Channel for the continuing coverage of this\u00a0breaking news story on this Friday evening, the death of Supreme Court\u00a0Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\u00a0I'm Martha MacCallum in New York.\u00a0Joining me now to continue our discussion of this huge development tonight\u00a0is Marc Thiessen, AUE scholar and Fox News contributor. Marc, thank you so\u00a0much for being here.\u00a0MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be with you.MACCALLUM: Obviously, there are a lot of questions now that come up with\u00a0this huge news this evening. But first your thoughts on the passing of Ruth\u00a0Bader Ginsburg, just an enormous life, an enormous pillar of the court.\u00a0THIESSEN: Well, any one, any time a giant of our democracy dies, it's a\u00a0heartbreaking moment, the passing of an era. She was truly a legal giant\u00a0who, I mean, I disagreed with her judicial philosophy, I disagreed with her\u00a0on a lot of things but she was an incredible Supreme Court justice, an\u00a0incredible innovator for the reason.\u00a0And also, she was such a wonderful model for us in these times where\u00a0partisanship has become almost toxic in our political ecosystem. Her, as\u00a0Shannon was just saying, her best friend on the court was Antonin Scalia,\u00a0someone she almost never joined in opinions with, disagreed, they had\u00a0vigorous discussions about weighty issues, and yet, they managed to love\u00a0opera together and love each other.\u00a0It's -- that's something to hold onto and to remember, because sadly, the\u00a0timing of her passing, we are going to see probably the in the next weeks\u00a0or months the greatest period of political vitriol in a modern history as\u00a0the debate over filling her seat takes on.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes. We're 46 days away from a presidential election. The last\u00a0time we went through this process was in March of 2016. An election was\u00a0coming, Mitch McConnell said that it was too close to an election to fill\u00a0that seat, President Obama put forward Merrick Garland and that was a\u00a0hugely controversial moment.\u00a0You know, as we continue to respect this moment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's\u00a0passing tonight, and so much will still be said about her biography and her\u00a0incredible life. Your thought though on, as we look a little bit forward in\u00a0this situation tonight, Marc.\u00a0THIESSEN: It's almost uncomfortable talking about it so soon but it has to\u00a0be discussed. You know, the reality is, yes. I would be shocked if Senate\u00a0Republic -- if Donald Trump didn't nominate somebody to replace her and if\u00a0the Senate Republicans didn't confirm that person before the end of the --\u00a0before the end of this term and probably before the election.\u00a0I interviewed Senator McConnell in 2018 about this and I asked him\u00a0specifically if another Supreme Court justice vacancy came up during an\u00a0election year, would you confirm them? And he said that absolutely yes. He\u00a0said that if the rule is, McConnell rule, is that, if the Senate is of the\u00a0different party than a president and a vacancy occur in the presidential\u00a0election year it doesn't get filled. That's what happened with Merrick\u00a0Garland.\u00a0I guarantee you, Martha, that if President Obama had a Democratic Senate in\u00a0that -- at that time, he would've confirmed Merrick Garland and Merrick\u00a0Garland would be on the Supreme Court today. President Trump has just\u00a0recently put out a new list of candidates and because he's gone through\u00a0this twice now, according to people on, he's vetted a lot of people who\u00a0came very close to getting picked, so it should not take them very long to\u00a0put somebody forward.\u00a0And because the Democrats made the mistake back in 2014 of getting rid of\u00a0judicial filibuster and then filibustered Neil Gorsuch who was supremely\u00a0qualified for the Supreme Court out of anger over Merrick Garland, they\u00a0created a situation where Republicans only need a simple majority.\u00a0So, I would -- I would say the likelihood is that her replacement will be\u00a0put forward by the president and confirmed by the Senate in pretty short\u00a0order.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, she was a remarkable woman, a remarkable justice.\u00a0She was the second woman to be chosen for the Supreme Court after Sandra\u00a0Day O'Connor was chosen, and of course, we have two women Elena Kagan and\u00a0Justice Sotomayor who have been chosen after that.\u00a0THIESSEN: Yes.MACCALLUM: You know, she was a fighter for women's issues. She was an\u00a0advocate of, as I said to Shannon, of someone who really had it all. She\u00a0was a mother. She was a great legal mind, as I've said. You know, when you\u00a0look at the importance of that and the balance of the court and all of\u00a0those issues, what goes through your mind tonight, Marc?\u00a0THIESSEN: That she is in many ways irreplaceable. That, there are -- I\u00a0mean, she was -- she was, as you say, she was a legal giant, she was an\u00a0intellectual giant, she was -- you know, we talk about in history -- they\u00a0talk about great men, the Churchill's of the world and the FDR's and all\u00a0the rest of it, she was a great woman. She was a person who achieved --MACCALLUM: She was.THIESSEN: -- enormous things for our country and for the legal system. And\u00a0she will be replaced but she really can't be replaced.\u00a0MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, I think about RBG, the documentary about her life\u00a0and the movie that was made recently --THIESSEN: Yes.MACCALLUM: -- about her life. And I'm so glad that there was the\u00a0opportunity for so many young women across the country to see her as a\u00a0young woman and to see what it was like for her coming up through the ranks\u00a0and to appreciate that.\u00a0I hope a lot of people are going to revisit those parts of her story as we\u00a0remember her life.\u00a0Marc, thank you very much. Great to have you with us tonight.THIESSEN: My pleasure.MACCALLUM: Marc Thiessen. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died at the age of 87.Joining me now by phone, Bret Baier, host of Special Report. Bret, great to\u00a0have you back with us this evening. Your thoughts on this very, very big\u00a0story tonight.\u00a0BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: It is, Martha. Good evening. Obviously, rest\u00a0in peace Justice Ginsburg. She was quite a figure not only on the court but\u00a0here in Washington. I recently saw her a few months ago at an event. And\u00a0you know, she was really about getting out and about, this is pre-COVID\u00a0time. And she's just a figure that had this following.\u00a0You just mentioned the movies that had come out and I commend those to you\u00a0as well, RBG and the life story is just really inspirational to a lot of\u00a0people. And all that she fought for as far as women -- women's rights, and\u00a0change the way the country deals with a lot of big issues.\u00a0Obviously, she came from the left but she had this relationship with\u00a0Antonin Scalia on that court who was obviously from the right and they got\u00a0along fabulously. And I saw them together at an opera in Washington and it\u00a0was quite something to see when they were both on the court.\u00a0MACCALLUM: You know, she talked about her faith, she was the first Jewish\u00a0woman on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia obviously a very strong Catholic\u00a0but they were both people who I think cared so deeply about their religious\u00a0culture and background, and of course opera which has been mentioned that\u00a0was something that they shared.\u00a0And she was such a remarkable figure and someone who was so admired, I\u00a0think by so many people. She was herself. She had a great sense of humor\u00a0and obviously just an enormous intellect.\u00a0So, Bret, obviously, you know, it feels you want so much to just be\u00a0remembering her life and we will do that over the course of the next\u00a0several days and covering her legacy, but we are within a breath of an\u00a0election in this country. And as Marc Thiessen just pointed out, the\u00a0president does have a Republican Senate.\u00a0So, your thoughts as we are 46 days away from a presidential election given\u00a0the history of what has happened in the past in these situations.\u00a0BAIER: This is truly remarkable as far as timing. Forty-six days to an\u00a0election. Senator McConnell, the majority leader has said if that happens\u00a0before the election, he would move forward. And you know, we talk about\u00a0what moves an electorate? This potentially moves an electorate but you\u00a0could play it, Martha, both ways.\u00a0Tonight is about the life and legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but make no\u00a0mistake about it. Filling that seat and who does it is going to be a major,\u00a0major part of this election.\u00a0MACCALLUM: It absolutely is and it will be the subject, you know, we have\u00a0said this many times, but there are so many huge news events between now\u00a0and this election and this is clearly a significant, significant moment as\u00a0we head towards this. Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Bret, thank you so much. Great to have you with us. Passed tonight at the\u00a0age of 87.\u00a0That is The Story of Friday, September 18th, 2020. The Story continues, so\u00a0we'll see you back here on Monday. Stay tuned for continued coverage of the\u00a0passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. We'll see you back\u00a0here on Monday. Good night, everybody.Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL\u00a0RIGHTS RESERVED.

Two teen girls in Utah are accused of swiping a classmate\u2019s pro-Trump hat, spitting\u00a0in his face and stomping\u00a0on his glasses in a high school because of his support for the president, authorities said. One of the girls recorded a video last month as the other approached the victim and swiped his \u201cMAGA\u201d hat, police in West Jordan, just south of Salt Lake City, said Tuesday. \u201cThey started ridiculing him, pushing him and stuff like that, then they actually spit on him,\u201d Sgt. J.C. Holt of the West Jordan Police Department told Fox News Tuesday. \u201cThe young man did not fight back or anything.\u201d MICHIGAN SUPERINTENDENT RIPS ANTI-TRUMP QUIZ TEACHER GAVE TO STUDENTS AS 'MISINFORMATION' Authorities declined to release the students\u2019 names because of their ages, but local media identified the victim as 15-year-old Braxton McElhaney. \u201cThe two girls, they kept antagonizing me, calling me a racist, saying I look retarded, and calling me a White supremacist, White privilege, because I was wearing my Trump hat,\u201d McElhaney told Salt Lake City-based KUTV. He said the girls also tore off his American flag face mask and threw it in the trash during the Sept. 3 altercation. \u201cThe way he was treated, the way that a lot of people are treated with all of this divide that we have going on in our country, it's ridiculous,\u201d the teen\u2019s father, Joe McElhaney, told KUTV. The district subsequently took administrative action against the girls, Holt\u00a0said.

A white female\u00a0protester was filmed yelling in the faces of two black male police officers in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0Tuesday in a viral video that has been viewed more than 2.1 million times, telling them that \"they're\u00a0a part of the problem.\" The video was tweeted by Henry Rodgers, a senior congressional correspondent for The Daily Caller, who has\u00a0been covering protests in the nation's capital since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take off your uniform? Are you afraid of police?\u201d the white woman, wearing a baseball cap and facial covering, yells at\u00a0two black officers in a police line stretching across the street in the newly renamed\u00a0Black Lives Matter plaza. HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS MOBILIZED TO PROTECT DC MONUMENTS AMID PROTESTS Rodgers, who is filming the altercation, interjects: \u201cI have a question for you. You\u2019re white and you\u2019re telling this to two black police officers? Don\u2019t you see the problem with that a little bit?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she responds. \u201cJust because I\u2019m white and I haven\u2019t experienced racism myself doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t fight for justice.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a part of the system. They\u2019re a part of the problem,\u201d the woman continues, referring to the officers. \u201cJust because they\u2019re black doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not a part of the problem. I\u2019m allowed to say this to whoever. Because I\u2019m white, racism is a white person\u2019s problem. \u201cRacism is my problem.

I don\u2019t give a sh**\u201d Another video filmed by Emily Jashinsky, a culture\u00a0editor for the conservative online magazine, The Federalist, showed the exchange from a different angle. Jashinsky captured a second moment when the same protester\u00a0approaches a black female officer, telling her to \u201cSmile for Breonna Taylor.\u201d The woman points her cell phone in the face of the\u00a0police officer, who does not respond and remains expressionless. \u201cSmile,\u201d a white woman (in lululemon) tells a black cop,\u201d Jashinsky tweeted. CONSERVATIVES SEE IRONY IN ASKING WHERE POLICE ARE AFTER REPORTER NEARLY ATTACKED IN DC 'AUTONOMOUS ZONE' Rodgers shared\u00a0an additional video of other protesters in D.C. calling for police officers to be poisoned. The edited clip appeared to be originally shared by the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. Hundreds of troops with the Washington, D.C., National Guard have mobilized to protect monuments in the nation's capital, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Wednesday. Protesters have targeted statues and other historical markers during ongoing demonstrations in the wake of George Floyd's police custody death in Minneapolis at the end of May. In a protest at the D.C. Emancipation Memorial Tuesday, one demonstrator announced that on Thursday they would tear down the memorial's statue of Abraham Lincoln standing over a freed slave. President Trump warned Tuesday morning that anyone caught vandalizing monuments or any other federal property would be subject to arrest and face up to 10 years in prison under federal law.

We're monitoring what the President is saying tonight, particularly about the Supreme Court vacancy, and if news occurs, of course, we'll go right there immediately.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, though, good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\u00a0\u00a0Last month, much of the City of Kenosha, Wisconsin burned to the ground. No one expected that to happen. Kenosha was not a hotbed of unrest. It all began very suddenly, when police tried to arrest a man with a long criminal record called Jacob Blake. Blake was wanted on felony sexual assault charges.\u00a0\u00a0Blake resisted arrest. He fought with police. They Tasered him, he kept resisting and then apparently police say he reached for a knife. Police then shot him in response.\u00a0\u00a0Blake survived, but the city did not. The media immediately described Blake's shooting as racially motivated. There was no evidence that that was true. There still isn't any evidence that's true.\u00a0\u00a0But riots broke out in response as if on cue. Mobs of Biden voters destroyed businesses and churches. They torched car lots and furniture stores. What had been a peaceful middle class city was destroyed. Here's what it looked like.\u00a0\u00a0[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 This went on for days. Hamstrung by local politicians, police did little to stop the destruction. A small number of citizens decided to fill the vacuum. One of them was a 17-year-old from suburban Chicago called Kyle Rittenhouse. On Tuesday, August 25th, Rittenhouse finished his shift as a lifeguard in Kenosha. Video shows he spent part of that day cleaning graffiti from the walls of the local high school.\u00a0\u00a0Rittenhouse then went downtown with a rifle to try to protect a car dealership that had been attacked by mobs the night before. What happened next destroyed Kyle Rittenhouse's life. It also ended the lives of two other people.\u00a0\u00a0Kyle Rittenhouse apparently shot three people, total; two of them fatally.\u00a0His attorneys argue that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.\u00a0Prosecutors in Wisconsin charged him with first-degree murder. So what is the truth about what happened that night?\u00a0\u00a0This is one of those rare cases when we might be able to reach firm conclusions about that before the trial. There was an enormous amount of video shot that night in Kenosha mostly by citizens with iPhones. We have video of all three of the shootings Kyle Rittenhouse was involved in.\u00a0\u00a0Critically, we also have video of the moments that preceded those shootings-- the context. We've already showed some of that video to you, but tonight, we're going to show you more. New never before seen footage of Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha.\u00a0\u00a0Now what you're about to see comes from the nonprofit, Fight Back that was formed by Rittenhouse's defamation attorney, Lin Wood.\u00a0\u00a0For the last month, there's been an enormous amount of propaganda surrounding this case, and virtually all of it has come from the left.\u00a0Congresswoman Ayanna Presley of Massachusetts, for example, denounced Kyle Rittenhouse as, quote, \"a white supremacist domestic terrorist.\" Now there's no evidence that is true. There never has been any evidence. It's a lie so far as we know.\u00a0\u00a0So the question is, what else are they lying about? Tonight, we're going to show you context from that night and we're going to let you decide what happened.\u00a0\u00a0Here to begin is video of Kyle Rittenhouse hours before the shootings took place. Now again, what you're about to see comes from a group, a nonprofit founded by Kyle Rittenhouse's defamation attorney. Here it is.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over):\u00a0 To prevent the total destruction of their community, good Samaritans united to guard local businesses. Among them was 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse.\u00a0\u00a0KYLE RITTENHOUSE, 17-YEAR-OLD CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER:\u00a0 Some people are getting injured. Our job is to protect this business and part of my job is also I would -- if there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way. That's why I have my rifle because I need to protect myself obviously.\u00a0\u00a0But I also have my med kit.\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over):\u00a0 Earlier that day, Rittenhouse volunteered to remove graffiti from Reuther Central High School in Kenosha.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 That was the day, and then night came, Kyle Rittenhouse found himself in downtown Kenosha in the middle of a riot. He wound up face to face with a convicted child molester called Joseph Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum was there protesting on behalf of BLM apparently he was committing arson.\u00a0\u00a0What happened next between the two of them is graphic. But if you want to understand how Joseph Rosenbaum died that night, it's important to see it here. It is.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over):\u00a0 Joseph Rosenbaum is seen starting more fires. Around that same time, Kyle Rittenhouse is spotted running with a fire extinguisher. With his face concealed, Rosenbaum emerges chasing after Rittenhouse. A single gunshot is fired by a protester identified as Alexander Blaine.\u00a0\u00a0From this angle, we see the muzzle flash of Blaine's handgun. Seconds later, Kyle Rittenhouse is pinned between parked cars. Directly in front of Rittenhouse, armed with bats and other weapons, a mob is forming a barricade.\u00a0\u00a0With no way out and no way to know who fired that shot, Rittenhouse turns to face Rosenbaum.\u00a0\u00a0Kyle Rittenhouse fired four shots.\u00a0\u00a0Seconds later, three additional shots are fired by an unknown shooter. One bullet graze Joseph Rosenbaum's head, another penetrated his right groin, his left thigh and his back.\u00a0\u00a0With a total of eight shots fired. It remains unclear that all four Rosenbaum's wounds were caused by Rittenhouse.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So to restate what we know, Kyle Rittenhouse fired four shots initially that night, another four were fired. We still don't know who fired them all. No one else has been arrested or charged.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, the mob turns on Kyle Rittenhouse. They assault him. It is clear they planned to kill him. Kyle Rittenhouse runs. They follow.\u00a0Rittenhouse trips and falls. They attack him, he shoots. It's all on video.\u00a0Watch.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Hey, what are you doing? Have you shot somebody?\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 I'm going to get the police.\u00a0\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 An unidentified protester strikes Rittenhouse in the head, knocking his hat off. Rittenhouse trips and falls to the ground.\u00a0Another protester attempts to jump on Rittenhouse, who then fires two shots into the air. With blunt force, another protester strikes Rittenhouse in the back of the head with a sharp edge of a skateboard then reaches for the rifle.\u00a0\u00a0Rittenhouse fires a single shot, striking the man in the chest.\u00a0\u00a0A third protester fakes as if he is surrendering, then suddenly advances with a handgun aimed at Rittenhouse. A single shot strikes the man's right bicep.\u00a0\u00a0While visiting him in the hospital, a friend of Grosskreutz posted the following photo and statement on social media. \"I just talked to Gaige Grosskreutz, too. His only regret was not killing the kid and hesitating to pull the gun before emptying the entire mag into him.\"\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So that's what happened that night in Kenosha, August 25, 2020.\u00a0It's on camera. You can assess for yourself what you think of it.\u00a0\u00a0As we said, as of tonight, only Kyle Rittenhouse has been charged in those shootings. It turns out, there was more than one. So the question before the court is, did Kyle Rittenhouse commit first-degree murder? Or was it something else? Was it as his lawyers say, self-defense?\u00a0\u00a0Judge Jeanine Pirro is the host of \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" on the FOX News Channel, the author of \"Don't Lie to Me: And Stop Trying to Steal our Freedom.\" She has studied this video and we're happy to have her on tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Judge, thanks so much for coming on. You've studied this. You've of course spent a lot of time in courtrooms. What do you make of it? What does this add to what we know about what happened?\u00a0\u00a0JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE:\u00a0 Well, first of all, thank God for the video. It puts truth to the lies and light to the darkness. You know the media grabs on to a narrative irrespective of what the facts are and they repeat it over and over and they don't care about the lives that are ruined in the meantime.\u00a0\u00a0But what this video shows is a clear demonstration of at the very least a need for self-defense, and I think the DA in this case should be very worried, in fact that he would be able to bring charges -- all of these charges in less than 48 hours is very disturbing. How could he possibly interview all the witnesses? And everything about this case suggests that Kyle went there to help. He had no intent -- and they claim that he's part of a militia. He is a vigilante. He's a white supremacist. He is none of that stuff.\u00a0\u00a0He went to help. His intent is clear in everything he says and does. He says, \"I'm coming here to help.\" And then after the first shot when he is being chased by Rosenbaum who was furious, because he is putting out the fires and he mistakes him for someone earlier. You know, he then stops and he has got a decision to make.\u00a0\u00a0He's got a bunch of people in front of him with bats and weapons, Rosenbaum, who is threatening him, and he turns around and Rosenbaum ends up getting shot. We still don't know if Kyle did the kill shot because we can't get the autopsy or the ballistic reports yet.\u00a0\u00a0But if you move on to the second shooting, what you realize is this kid is not a mass murderer. There were several times he could have continued shooting. Twice, he shot in the air. Once he turned around, and the guy put his hands up, he didn't shoot him. He kept moving.\u00a0\u00a0He put his hands up, he tried to get the police's attention. He tried to call the police for help. Everything about what he said and what he did indicates that he is not someone who went there with the intent to kill.\u00a0\u00a0Now what this DA should recognize is this: there is no shame in exonerating a defendant if he is not guilty. In fact, a prosecutor's job is to make sure that we do not wrongly convict the innocent as much as it is a job to make sure that we convict the guilty.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Let me ask you two questions. One, the only reason this was going on in the first place, these riots were occurring is because politicians in Kenosha pulled the police back and allowed them to happen and into that vacuum moved people like Kyle Rittenhouse with firearms.\u00a0\u00a0So the politicians in Kenosha are responsible for everything that happened that night during the riots. They allowed it to happen. When are they going to be punished for that?\u00a0\u00a0PIRRO:\u00a0 Well, you know, they're not going to be punished. But this is an example of what can happen to anyone. Because when the police stand down, and in this video, you see, there's a lot of action yelling fires, the police aren't putting the fires down. The police are down the street if you watch this video.\u00a0\u00a0This young kid is putting a fire out, another person is pointing a fire out. And you know whether the police were told to stand down, they're all Democrats. That's what we know. The mayor is a Democrat, the DA is a Democrat; and this can happen in any town to any one of us when the left comes in with lawlessness, and we're simply trying to protect our property.\u00a0\u00a0Kyle Rittenhouse has been villainized here, and he has been demonized. And I think it should be just the opposite. Thank God for the video and the fact that we are able to identify what went on.\u00a0\u00a0And what's curious, Tucker, is the fact that just about everybody here has a criminal record and I understand that one person's name is not truly his name. It's an alias and his real name suggests he has got a rap sheet a mile long.\u00a0\u00a0These are people with guns coming to protest, looking for trouble. This young kid is an innocent man. He is looking to help. He is you know -- he is all-American and he is trying to just make sure his town is safe.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Meanwhile, the guy who pointed a gun at him and later said he wanted to kill him has not been charged with anything, which tells you a lot about how justice operates in Kenosha. Jeanine Pirro, great to see you.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0PIRRO:\u00a0 Right. Good to see you, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, last night on this show, we told you the truth about certain billionaires, politically active billionaires trying to influence the way justice is meted out in this country by buying local DA races.\u00a0\u00a0Well, that upset other billionaires, at least, in Silicon Valley and they tried to suppress and censor our video. We will explain it after the break.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, we are continuing to monitor the President's rally tonight in Moon County, Pennsylvania. He is talking about the military as we speak. We'll tell you if news breaks. We will be right back.\u00a0\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0\u00a0 ... and think of this -- think of this. For 16 years, President\u00a0Obama, President Bush household income rose $2,945.00. Right? That's over --\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 A lot of cities aren't really enforcing the law anymore. In places like Portland and San Francisco and Philadelphia, violent crimes are sometimes treated like traffic violations. Why is that?\u00a0\u00a0Well, last night on the show, we pointed out that billionaire ideologues like George Soros have spent millions of dollars on local district attorney races. Their goal is to replace prosecutors who prosecute with partisan operatives who prevent the enforcement of the law.\u00a0\u00a0Criminals commit crimes, police arrest them. Soros backed DAs release them.\u00a0That is not a conspiracy theory. We have watched it happen again and again.\u00a0People die as a result. Our society degrades as a result. Things fall apart.\u00a0\u00a0Why does George Soros want that? We have no idea and we're not going to speculate. But we can say with certainty that George Soros has done this to the rest of us. It is a matter of public record.\u00a0\u00a0Soros and his lawyers hate it when Americans point that out. They've intimidated many news organizations into silence on the subject. They don't think you have a right to notice what George Soros is doing to your country. We disagree with that, so we pointed it out.\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after we did, Soros's fellow billionaires came riding to his rescue. Twitter slapped a warning label on our video from last night's show. They claim to contain, quote, \"sensitive content.\"\u00a0\u00a0For context, there are porn feeds on Twitter, huge porn feeds with graphic video and more than a million followers that have no such warnings from Twitter. So hardcore pornography is fine, let your kids watch, but criticizing George Soros is obscene.\u00a0\u00a0We asked Twitter about this. They claimed it was all a mistake. They always claim that, they're liars. Twitter didn't block rioters from sharing the location of Mitch McConnell's house, but stating obvious facts about George Soros, Twitter's algorithm said that was dangerous content.\u00a0\u00a0This is censorship, obviously. But more than that, it's a metaphor for what is happening to our country and to our politics. America's grotesquely distorted economy is making a tiny group of people richer than anyone has ever been in human history. Those people suddenly run everything, including our elections. They are subverting our political system, far more brazenly, and with much greater effect than that dastardly Vladimir Putin ever dreamed of doing.\u00a0\u00a0Our billionaire class is the real threat to democracy. That's obvious if you think about it, which is why you're told you're not allowed to think about it. Twitter won't let you. Democrats never even mention it. It wasn't so long ago that Joe Biden used to lecture us about getting money out of politics. Remember that?\u00a0\u00a0As recently as last year, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren hounded Michael Bloomberg on stage for trying to buy the Democratic nomination. In case you've forgotten, here it is.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):\u00a0 The fundamental problem in this country is the power that the billionaire class has over the economic and political life of this country.\u00a0\u00a0SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):\u00a0 I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.\u00a0\u00a0SANDERS:\u00a0 One person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections.\u00a0\u00a0WARREN:\u00a0 We've got billionaires who think they can just buy an election.\u00a0Case in point Michael Bloomberg.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Bernie Sanders may be an extremist, but he was right. Elizabeth Warren may be a fake Indian who doesn't know how to drink beer, but she was right, too. Warren doesn't talk about that anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Michael Bloomberg has promised to spend more than $100 million to make Joe Biden President, one man spending a hundred million dollars in a single presidential election. But that's just the beginning of what Michael Bloomberg is doing. Bloomberg is also spending tens of millions of dollars to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives.\u00a0\u00a0And then today we learned that Bloomberg has raised $16 million to pay the court fines for 32,000 Hispanic and black Florida voters and apparently choosing them by race who have felony convictions. Why is he doing this?\u00a0Well, Bloomberg advisers just admitted it out loud, quote, \"It immediately activates tens of thousands of voters who are predisposed to vote for Joe Biden.\"\u00a0\u00a0Cynical? Scary? Yes. It is.\u00a0\u00a0What does Elizabeth Warren have to say about that? About Bloomberg trying to buy this election? Well, nothing. Of course. Apparently, it's fine now.\u00a0\u00a0And what about our pampered revolutionary from suburban Westchester, Sandy Cortez? Cortez has told us she doesn't think billionaires should exist unless they're giving her power, in which case she slobbers all over them just like everyone else.\u00a0\u00a0Again, it didn't used to be this way. Democrats used to pretend that they cared about democracy. Once again, we refer you to last year's primary debates.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0WARREN:\u00a0 The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900.00 a bottle wine. Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next President of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), FORMER MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA:\u00a0 This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass. Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump.\u00a0\u00a0WARREN:\u00a0 I do not sell access to my time. I don't you call time, millionaires and billionaires.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 I don't do call time with millionaires and billionaires. Oh, yes, you do. In fact, that's now the entire Joe Biden for President Campaign -- call time with millionaires and billionaires.\u00a0\u00a0The dozen people who gave the legal maximum to the Joe Biden victory fund$620,000.00 check required, half of them came from Silicon Valley and you'll recognize many of their names. Billionaires, in fact, like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moscovitz; Zynga founder, Mark Pincus; Steve Jobs's widow, Laurene Powell Jobs.\u00a0\u00a0What's interesting is that all of these people are -- and we checked -- white. They're also clearly highly privileged. And here's the funny thing, somehow there aren't BLM protests outside of their homes accusing them of white privilege. Why is that? Because unlike blue collar police officers or your third grader sitting through yet another lecture on white supremacy and privilege, these people are funding the Democratic Party. So they're immune from all that. See how that works.\u00a0\u00a0You get yelled at and humiliated, maybe fired. Your son can't get a job because he is the wrong color, but billionaires get a total pass. In fact, they're heroes. They're not privileged. They're heroes.\u00a0\u00a0Wall Street gets the same deal. Big Finance is so overwhelmingly for Joe Biden, that Biden's handlers demanded a minimum of a million dollars before you even show up for a virtual event.\u00a0\u00a0But wait a minute, you may be asking. Haven't Democrats promised to police Wall Street? How can they police Wall Street if they are the choice of Wall Street? Well, pay no attention to the details, says Joe Biden. He's on your side.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 I really do view this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue, and I really mean it.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Joe Biden really means it. In other words, he is lying. We checked the numbers. Joe Biden's campaign has raised more than a million dollars from donors living on -- that's right -- Park Avenue.\u00a0The Trump campaign by contrast has raised just $127,000.00 from the same area, about one-tenth. In case you're wondering, by the way, Biden hasn't raised nearly as much from people in Scranton, even \"The Washington Post\"\u00a0had to ultimately admit what's going on quote, \"While Biden publicly calls out Wall Street excesses and promises to rein them in, Biden staffers privately are reassuring industry leaders that he won't focus on the issue in office.\" End quote.\u00a0\u00a0One investment bank reported the Biden campaign quote, \" ... basically said, 'Listen, this is just an exercise to keep the Elizabeth Warren people happy and don't read too much into it.'\" Yes, it's fine.\u00a0\u00a0We also shouldn't read too much into Joe Biden's pledge not to take funding from lobbyists or corporate PACs. It turns out fundraising data shows that's a lie, too. One of Biden's top advisers, a man called Steve Ricchetti is in fact a longtime pharmaceutical lobbyist. So we know what's happening here. Joe Biden has said on camera what Big Money does to the political process. Watch this.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\u00a0 Lobbyists are bad people.\u00a0Special interest groups are not bad people. But guess what? They are corrosive. People who accept money from them aren't bad people, but it is human nature.\u00a0\u00a0You go out, Lynn, and bundle $250,000.00 for me, all legal, and then you call me after an election, Joe, I'd like to come and talk to you about something. You didn't buy me, but it is human nature. You helped me? I'm going to say sure, Lynn. Come on in.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Oh. That's the old Joe Biden and that's as close to an admission of political corruption as you will ever see on camera. Maybe Twitter will put a warning on it at some point.\u00a0\u00a0Josh Hawley is the Senator from Missouri. It's fair to say no one in the Senate has done more to fight tech censorship than he has. We're happy to have him on tonight. Senator, thanks so much for coming on.\u00a0\u00a0So rich people have always had disproportionate influence on everything, including politics and restaurant reservations. And you know, everything.\u00a0But it does seem like we're in a moment now, where a tiny group of the richest people in history are having a wildly disproportionate effect on this race. Am I imagining that?\u00a0\u00a0SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):\u00a0 You're not imagining it and that those people control the Big Tech companies, those people are going to buy in the case of George Soros every District Attorney in the United States of America.\u00a0You just look at Soros. He spent $17 million since 2015 alone trying to buy district attorneys, and he has had tremendous success in my home State of Missouri and St. Louis, in Philadelphia, Florida, and Texas.\u00a0\u00a0Look all around the country, and now Big Tech, Tucker, wants to silence any criticism of George Soros and what he is doing. It's the same group of people, as you point out the billionaire class, who have become radical leftists, or coddling radical leftists. It's no wonder that the average working person in this country feels like they're shut out of the deal.\u00a0They don't have any voice, and this is why.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 I can't think of a rich person who has had a greater effect on the way Americans live in the way American society operates in my lifetime than George Soros. And yet, news organizations have been bullied into not mentioning that, because somehow billionaires get a pass. How does that work? And why should we allow tech companies to cover for a fellow billionaire who is changing our country?\u00a0\u00a0HAWLEY:\u00a0 And we shouldn't and that's exactly the point. I mean, to have the idea that Big Tech now will not permit you or any other journalist to cover what Soros is trying to do, to bring scrutiny to what he is trying to do in purchasing district attorneys, and by the way, it's no coincidence, Tucker as you pointed out that these same District Attorneys that he has bought and funded are the ones who refuse to prosecute rioters, refuse to prosecute looters. They are the ones where crime is exploding, the cities where crime is exploding all over our country.\u00a0\u00a0And yet, if you try to scrutinize that, if you try to raise questions, now Big Tech is putting their thumb on the scale and saying no, you can't cover it. No, you can't raise the questions.\u00a0\u00a0This is why, Tucker, this alliance of Big Government and Big Tech and the billionaire class needs to be broken up. These people have a stranglehold increasingly on our news in this country, on our communication in this country. They want to have a stranglehold on our politics, and it's time we put a stop to it.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 George Soros is the victim here. So you can't criticize him. No, actually, we're the victims here. Billionaires are not victims. We're the victim. That's true.\u00a0\u00a0Senator Hawley, great to see you. Thank you for everything you've been doing. I appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0HAWLEY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 So for years, Joe Biden has defended our constitutional system.\u00a0He has opposed court packing. Yesterday, he changed his mind, which seems like he did. We'll tell you what he said.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, there's a large crowd tonight. At the President's rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. We will continue to monitor it for news. We will be right back.\u00a0\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0\u00a0 ... with your neighbors. But if you're going to protest and burn\u00a0down stores and loot stores, and shoot people, and step on people's faces, and do all sorts of bad things that these people will protect you from doing if they were given their rightful power and dignity.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 For at least 15 years going back to 2005, and maybe earlier, but to 2005 that we can be certain of, Joe Biden has publicly opposed expanding the size of the Supreme Court to pack it with more Democrats.\u00a0\u00a0When he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden was consistent. Just last year, he said the Democrats would quote, \"live to rule that day\" if they packed the Supreme Court, as Franklin Roosevelt tried to do in the 30s and had to stop because of backlash in the public that hated the idea. Biden separately said the court would lose all credibility if Democrats did that.\u00a0\u00a0Well, yesterday, Joe Biden changed his mind, air quotes around the word mind, of course, or probably more accurately, his handlers told him to say something different, so he did.\u00a0\u00a0Ask whether you'd support loading the bench with left-wing activists, as Chuck Schumer has demanded. Biden said it was, quote, \"a legitimate question.\" He then refused to say whether he supported it or not, he wasn't going to give an answer because it would, quote, \"shift the focus\" and quote, \"change the subject\" from other issues like whether Donald Trump should be able to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\u00a0\u00a0Change the subject? What other subject is there? Joe Biden is running to be President of the United States. He may not be aware of that, but he is.\u00a0Voters, once again overwhelmingly oppose the idea of tearing down our third branch of government by packing the Supreme Court, making it a purely political operation, even more than it already is.\u00a0\u00a0It's a popular solution in some circles on Twitter and in the universities, the root of all poison and that's about it. Everybody else knows it would destroy our government. It's not even a controversial point.\u00a0\u00a0Last year, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, easily the most left-wing jurist in generations acknowledged that court packing would wreck the court. Watch.\u00a0\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0RUTH BADER GINSBURG, U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE:\u00a0 I have heard that there are some people on the Democratic side who would like to increase the number of judges. I think that was a bad idea when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to pack the court.\u00a0\u00a0If anything, it would make the court appear partisan, it would be one side saying when we're in power, it was only to enlarge the number.\u00a0\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, like, really what we need to do in this moment is wreck more of our ancient institutions, please. Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood that was insane and destructive.\u00a0\u00a0But now the lunatics who order us to follow her deathbed dying wishes, want to ignore her actual expressed wishes from last year. And without any protest, Joe Biden is going along with it, because he thinks, well, who knows what he thinks or if he does.\u00a0\u00a0If you needed more evidence that Joe Biden isn't a candidate so much as a pawn for partisans who are trying to get back in power at any cost -- there you have it. For eight days this month, by the way, Joe Biden's handlers shut him off from the press starting at noon, or earlier than that. That is unprecedented in a presidential campaign with fewer than two months to go.\u00a0\u00a0They don't want you to be able to ask questions of Joe Biden. Maybe he can't handle questions, even basic softball questions he has been getting, including from one reporter at \"The Washington Post.\" Why aren't you angry at Donald Trump? That was an actual question. We don't know why they're hiding him.\u00a0\u00a0One thing we do know for certain, if Joe Biden can't even tell us whether he plans to destroy a branch of our government, he has no business running any branch of government.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, California, our biggest state; easily our pretty state, the state with the biggest economy, the state with an amazing history continues to degrade and fall apart. It's on fire a lot of the time, but the people who run it don't want you to pay any attention to the way they've mismanaged the State of California.\u00a0\u00a0If you paid attention, you might have noticed that for example, California has been giving away millions of dollars this year to scammers making fraudulent unemployment claims. Many of the people committing fraud have come in from out of state. The scam is so well-known there's even a new rap song about it. Here it is.\u00a0\u00a0[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS \"EDD\" BY NUKE BIZZLE]\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 In case you couldn't make out the lyrics. Here's one, \"You got to sell cocaine, I can just file a claim.\"\u00a0\u00a0A lot of the frauds taking place in the City of Beverly Hills, in the shopping district, the Rodeo Drive. In Beverly Hills alone, police recovered 129 fraudulently obtained state debit cards intended for people who are unemployed.\u00a0\u00a0Those 129 total were valued at $2.5 million -- all taxpayer money. Cops arrested dozens of the scammers. Now California has suspended new unemployment claims entirely for two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Lester Friedman is the Mayor of Beverly Hills. He's watched all of this and we're honored to have him on tonight. Mayor Friedman, thanks so much for coming on. Describe if you would -- I think a lot of our viewers aren't aware this is happening -- what has taken place in Beverly Hills recently?\u00a0\u00a0MAYOR LESTER FRIEDMAN, BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Tucker.\u00a0Well, what's going on is the EDD cards, which are unemployment based, have been sent out all over the country and they're being spent in our community as well as a lot of communities in the City of Beverly Hills.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 What's interesting is -- and ironic and bitterly so -- is that money meant for the unemployed is being spent at some of the most expensive stores in the world in your town.\u00a0\u00a0FRIEDMAN:\u00a0 That's absolutely correct. And it's really unfortunate that people who really needed the money were scammed and it went to people who really didn't need it, and just wanted to obtain funds from the people of the State of California, to the detriment of those who really needed it.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 I think it's so interesting that you're talking about this in public, because of course, it helps the economy of your town. Are you offended on principle? I mean, I'm just interested in your motive, and I'm so grateful that you're willing to talk about it. But why are you talking about this? Since it helps your town.\u00a0\u00a0FRIEDMAN:\u00a0 Well, Tucker, it doesn't help anybody. It doesn't help society.\u00a0While some merchants may have benefited in the short run because of this, the harm that it did to most of the state is just -- something that should have never, ever happened and that's why we're speaking out about it.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, good for you. And the only reason I know about this is because a friend of mine from Beverly Hills called me about it, who is not very political, but he said you should know this and everybody in the whole state knows this is going on. Why didn't authorities in California shut it down earlier?\u00a0\u00a0FRIEDMAN:\u00a0 Well, it took our Police Department to really figure out what the scam was, what it was, was that people from out-of-state primarily because 90 percent -- 90 percent -- of the arrestees are from out-of-state somehow got this information on the Dark Web and we're able to file claims and have the cards sent to them or to addresses within California, pick them up and then use them.\u00a0\u00a0The numbers that you gave, the $2.5 million is really now up to $3.6 million, and our Police Department has also recovered about $450,000.00 worth of actual cash and along the way, there were handguns also that were obtained. So those people were really protecting their territory with those guns. So we're really glad that we were able to get to the bottom of this before anyone else did.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, I really appreciate your telling us about this. Mayor Lester Freidman of Beverly Hills, California. Thanks so much.\u00a0\u00a0FRIEDMAN:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, new details tonight about a dinner, an intimate dinner, that former President Bill Clinton shared with Ghislaine Maxwell -- assuming that's how to pronounce her name -- in 2014. That was years after she was outed for her involvement in the child sex ring, but he had dinner with her anyway. We've got to tell straight ahead.\u00a0\u00a0Also, as we said, the President speaking tonight in Pennsylvania, 42 days until Election Day. We are monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 We are learning a little more today about what Bill Clinton has been doing in his spare time for the past 20 years. In 2014, it turns out he had an intimate dinner with Ghislaine Maxwell in Los Angeles. Maxwell, of course is famous and was famous then for procuring underage girls for sex with Jeffrey Epstein. FOX's Rick Leventhal has details on this story -- Rick.\u00a0\u00a0RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hey, Tucker, Bill Clinton knew Jeffrey Epstein and his accused accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell for nearly 30 years.\u00a0\u00a0The couple visited the White House, Maxwell reportedly sat front row at Clinton's daughter, Chelsea's wedding and the President was in Epstein's home and office and flew on the disgraced financier's private jet.\u00a0\u00a0Now, \"The Daily Beast\" reports Clinton invited Maxwell to a cozy dinner with a small circle of high profile friends in 2014 years after it became known Epstein was accused of abusing girls at his Palm Beach mansion and was the target of lawsuits for sex trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0And at the time of the dinner, \"The Daily Beast\" reports Clinton staffers knew of Maxwell's alleged involvement in Epstein's criminal behavior, arguing about whether she should be invited at all.\u00a0\u00a0Still \"The Beast\" reports Clinton broke bread with Maxwell at the trendy Crossroads Kitchen, a vegan hotspot on Melrose Avenue here in Los Angeles with other guests including actor Sean Penn and producer, Steve Bing, who committed suicide earlier this year.\u00a0\u00a0\"The Beast\" reports Maxwell went to the dinner with tech CEO, Scott Borgerson now, rumored to be her husband. One source is quoted as saying, \"Think of all the people Clinton knows in LA and Ghislaine gets to attend.\"\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, \"The New York Post\" reports the top prosecutor in the Virgin Islands is causing panic among many more rich and famous because he is seeking more than 20 years of flight logs to find out who was spending time with Epstein and Maxwell at his private island where countless crimes may have been committed -- Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Pedo Islands. Rick Leventhal, thanks so much for that.\u00a0\u00a0Tammy Bruce has been following all of this since the very beginning. She is of course the host of \"Get Tammy Bruce\" which you should on FOX Nation and we're happy to have her on tonight. Hey, Tammy.\u00a0\u00a0TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Thank you. Hi there. Yes, you know, I follow this and nobody else has to get all the toxic crap that the story generates. I mean, it's just awful. Right? So I'm watching it so no one else has to.\u00a0\u00a0Look at this story just came out. This was about a dinner in 2014 and two years for Hillary runs for President, and yet only now it's coming out when the number of people in that restaurant and of course they're all vegetarians because they want to save the planet, and in the meantime, they're sex trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0And as an example, \"The Daily Beast\" reports that TMZ reported only that Bill Clinton had dinner that night with Sean Penn, one person at the table when already it was a huge story with Maxwell's involvement. We knew it was Epstein, but her involvement in particular.\u00a0\u00a0And there it is, and my sense on this is it now that it is being reported is that there are seasons to what the left wants to deal with. We had a brief moment of the #MeToo Movement. No one else -- everybody else has dropped that like a hot potato except for people like a couple of actresses, Rose McGowan and Evan Rachel Wood, but now it's not -- it's not good. It's passe.\u00a0\u00a0Now the issue of the season is racism. But it's almost as though they use these issues to cover up what else they've been doing or to ignore what they've kept on doing for no one at that restaurant to have reported this or to have said, hey, wait a minute. Ghislaine Maxwell was there -- indicates that for all these years, even with all of this exploding and the Weinstein stuff, nobody said anything. That tells you it is still ingrained. They're still doing it and everything they say they care about has been a fraud.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Very perceptive. It's almost like a cover. Tammy, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0BRUCE:\u00a0 Almost.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Almost. I know, it looks like one. It's funny that way.\u00a0\u00a0BRUCE:\u00a0 Thank you, Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Great to see you.\u00a0\u00a0Well, another American city is preparing for possible riots and destruction ahead of a court decision that is apparently imminent. What city? What country is this? A live report and all the details just after the break.\u00a0\u00a0TRUMP:\u00a0\u00a0 ... never imagined. But if I just did that, a sixth branch of the\u00a0U.S. Military. That would be a big deal. That's like one of many, many things we passed. VA Choice and VA Accountability.\u00a0\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 The City of Louisville, Kentucky being held hostage tonight by the mob. The city is under a state of emergency ahead of a decision in the Breonna Taylor case. You may remember that case. Officers shot and killed a woman called Breonna Taylor in a crossfire after someone else in the home opened fire on the police. Matt Finn is in Louisville standing by for us tonight. Hey Matt.\u00a0\u00a0MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Tucker, large portions of Louisville are under complete lockdown right now. City trucks and barricades in place preventing. Traffic police are only allowing essential workers and residents downtown tonight.\u00a0\u00a0In this area, we watched as countless businesses boarded up today, probably hundreds, all in anticipation of a grand jury decision whether to criminally charge the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor's shooting death.\u00a0\u00a0We simply don't know when that decision will come, but based on all the preparations happening in Louisville tonight, an announcement seems imminent.\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Courthouse was also boarded up and closed. The Governor says he is ready to deploy the National Guard. Protesters demand the three officers be arrested and charged with homicide. One officer was fired. The other two are still on the job.\u00a0\u00a0Breonna Taylor's family and attorneys demand the officers be charged with a minimum of second-degree manslaughter, but legal experts we talked to here say it is certainly possible some or all three officers may not be charged with homicide, and that could spark some serious unrest here in Louisville-- Tucker.\u00a0\u00a0CARLSON:\u00a0 Unbelievable. Matt Finn, thanks so much.\u00a0\u00a0To restate the obvious, just because you don't like a court decision doesn't mean you get to hurt people or burn buildings or steal things that don't belong to you and when the mob tries to do that, you have an absolute right to defend yourself and your property. Period.\u00a0\u00a0And even if everyone else in America forgets that or pretends it's not true, it doesn't mean that it's not true because it is. Period.\u00a0\u00a0This is America. We have honor. We have decency. We follow the rules. We have a system that works. Let's not forget that.\u00a0\u00a0We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.\u00a0\u00a0Sean Hannity from New York.\u00a0\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

An unidentified passenger was recorded during a racially tinged rant while not wearing a mask on a Spirit Airlines flight last week. According to a report, the plane had landed in Sacramento when the woman got up to use the bathroom at the back of the plane. EASYJET PASSENGER ARRESTED AFTER FIGHTS INVOLVING RACE, PAPER AIRPLANE: REPORT In the video, a flight attendant is seen arguing with the woman about needing to get to her door. The altercation appears to begin when the flight attendant attempts to move past the passenger in the aisle and she says, \u201cdon\u2019t push me.\" \"Ok, excuse me, I need to get,\" the flight attendant can be heard saying before she appears to push the woman's backpack. \u201cDid you see what she did? She put her hands at me. She wants me to go to jail, y\u2019all. See how she\u2019s antagonizing me?\u201d the passenger says. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER The passenger continued to claim the flight attendant was \u201cgetting aggressive\u201d with her as she refused to move out of the aisle. In the tense clip, the passenger, who is a Black woman, gets into an argument with another passenger whom she refers to as \u201cWhite privilege.\u201d \u201cWhat do I got to listen to? Are you my boss? You're White privilege, you are not my boss. Sit down! You are White privilege, sit down! You wait for me to get to my bathroom. Have respect for me,\u201d the woman is heard saying.

While she is being escorted off, other passengers can be heard applauding and laughing. It is unclear why the woman was waiting for the bathroom in the beginning as another passenger can be heard saying there is nothing blocking her from using it.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\" August 28, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday, what a week it was. The President accepted his party's nomination last night from the White House. He gave a long speech. It was more than 70 minutes. Compare that to Joe Biden's 24-minute Zoom call last week, and the President address wasn't loaded with applause lines. It wasn't written in sound bites for Twitter. It was pretty meaty. He spoke at length about trade and manufacturing and jobs. He warned about illegal immigration and the burden of more refugees from dangerous countries. He pointed to Joe Biden's record which is thin as a corrupt and incompetent political lifer. A man who after 50 years can't point to a single significant policy achievement. But the best part of this speech, the moment that defined it really came early on, when Trump affirmed what you already know. This is not a wicked nation. Our cops are not inherently racist, neither is America. They tell you that constantly, but they are lying. The United States has flaws, but it's also the President, reminded us last night, the most free, just and exceptional nation on Earth. That's true. In our country, free speech is allowed. Violence is not allowed. What separates American democracy from Taliban theocracy, for example, is that in America, people can disagree with one another and disagree with the government without fearing for their lives. This used to be obvious it was the foundation of our civic life. And yet, all of a sudden, Joe Biden could never say this out loud. His voters have destroyed cities across the country and murdered dozens of Americans. He must stay silent about that. But Donald Trump doesn't have to and so he said it and as a result, for the first time since the Wuhan coronavirus arrived here, the President seemed likely to win reelection. Democrats are watching carefully, they know this. They can smell something has changed. They know why. Normal people hate the violence they have unleashed. And that's why this week, finally after months, Joe Biden issued a tepid statement gently scolding the rioters, but it's too late for that. This has gone on for too long. Joe Biden's voters no longer listen to him. Last night as the President spoke, a group of Biden voters gathered outside the White House to threaten and intimidate anyone who dare support Donald Trump. They waited to ambush attendees as they came out of the convention. The Mayor of Washington, an incompetent hack called Muriel Bowser made all of this possible. Bowser has been on the mob's side since the very first day. She allowed the mob to harass and terrify elderly taxpayers as they walked on city streets they pay for. Watch this. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) CARLSON: The cops didn't protect these people. Muriel Bowser won't let them protect these people, she won't let them do their jobs. Law enforcement in Washington, D.C. as in so many places controlled by the Democratic Party has become completely politicized just as it is in the third world. If you don't vote the right way, if you don't vote for them, you don't get police protection, the mob is allowed to hurt you. Last night, things fell apart so quickly outside the White House that the Secret Service told Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and his wife, Kelley and two of their friends to get on a bus and leave the immediate area. The senator then planned to get an Uber back to his hotel, but the streets were blocked and no one would let them through. That's when Rand Paul was attacked along with the officers protecting him. Watch. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) CARLSON: These people are not only violent, they're incredibly stupid. They are mouth breathers. They're morons. They had nothing. Say her name, they shouted at Rand Paul. They were talking about Breonna Taylor, a Kentucky woman who was killed in a no-knock police raid when the police came under fire. In fact, as it happens, Rand Paul himself authored a bill to end no-knock police raids and that bill was literally called the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act. Irony of ironies, but it didn't matter. Paul has had to face political violence before. In 2017, he was nearly murdered by a Bernie Sanders supporter, then he was attacked by his neighbor apparently for political reasons and had to have part of his lung removed. It took months to get better. We'll talk to Rand Paul in a minute about what happened last night, but he was not the only one attacked. A van carrying Fox News staff, just technical people mostly doing their jobs, non-political people was blocked and boarded in the middle of a city street. Watch. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) CARLSON: We want to be clear, we don't think the van was targeted because Fox News employees were inside. It seems like the Biden voters were pounding on it had no idea who was riding it. They didn't care. Their assumption seemed to be that everyone in a motor vehicle is an agent of white supremacy. Certainly, they think that of anyone in uniform. Watch as BLM lunatics attack a black cop in Washington this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Traitor. Traitor, that's what you are. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jim Crow, Uncle Tom. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: This isn't happening by accident. It didn't happen five years ago. It's happening now not because police are more brutal or more unarmed African-American men are being killed by the police. That's not happening. It's a total hoax. It's happening because Democrats, the leadership of that party are encouraging it and have been for quite some time. Here is Massachusetts Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley openly calling for violence in the streets early this month. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): Hold them accountable. Make the phone calls, send the e-mail. show up. You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives. And unfortunately, there's plenty to go around. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: There needs to be unrest in the streets. We've been watching what unrest in the streets look like, Ayanna Pressley says we need more, and so there is more. Pressley like Nancy Pelosi and Barack and Michelle Obama and so many other leaders in that party is a racial arsonist. She wants Americans to despise and fear each other. She is pleased when things burn. Pressley has no skill. She has never created anything in her life. She has built nothing. Tearing things down is the only way Ayanna Pressley and people like Ayanna Presley become powerful, and so they push hate and chaos. Republicans for all their many and very obvious faults, many of which we point out on this show don't do this. They don't do anything like this. When was the last time a mob of Trump voters torched a Wendy's or looted a Target? And if you did, if you watched them do that, how would you feel about it? You'd be repulsed. Do you think Republican leaders would defend Trump voters if they did that? Do you think they'd encourage them to do it again? Please. That's a rhetorical question. You know the answer. It's obvious. Only Biden voters do this. Only the left does this and they've done it for a long time. A year ago this month, for example, they gathered outside Mitch McConnell's home where his family lives. Do you even remember what this was about? Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are McConnell's house. This (bleep) thinks he is about to get some rest. Not if the children that you're kidnapping can't get any rest. Not in families who are getting murdered can't get any rest. (Bleep) Mitch. He's in there nursing his little broken arm. He should have broken his little raggedy wrinkled ass neck. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Murder Turtle. CROWD: Murder Turtle. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Murder Turtle. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just stab the mother (bleep) in the heart. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Just stab the emeffer in the heart. They mocked the 77-year-old McConnell who was recovering from surgery. They said that out loud, it was on tape. We probably played it at the time. We didn't take it seriously though. The rest of us should have stopped what we were doing that day and demanded -- demanded from law enforcement, demanded from Democratic leaders an end to the threats, to the lunatic behavior, to the implied violence. None of that has any place in a civilized country, much less this country. But we didn't do that. We let it pass. We ignored it over time. And so the threats continued and then the threats became violence as they inevitably do. The question now is can we stop it? Rand Paul is a senator from Kentucky. He joins us tonight. Senator, thanks so much for coming on. And his wife, Kelley Paul, also. Thanks a lot. SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Actually, I'll start with you, Mrs. Paul. You wrote I thought a very affecting piece in \"The Washington Examiner\" today about what you experienced last night. Can you tell us what it was like to be in the middle of the threats and the screaming? KELLEY PAUL, AUTHOR: It was absolutely terrifying. I have never experienced anything like that in my life. I hope no one else ever has to. We felt completely powerless. Before some of the video that I think you have shown where the police with the bikes were kind of creating a moving barricade for us. In the minutes before the police with the bikes showed up, we were completely encircled and surrounded, pressed up against two cops who -- we were surrounded by people who were screaming in our faces, yelling that they were going to F us up, screaming, \"Say her name.\" And at one point, you know, at first I was trying to look in their eyes and trying to have any kind of reason or to see someone as a human being, and I realized, they did not see us as human beings. We were Trump supporters, so they absolutely despised us. Even though if we were ever in a situation and maybe could have talked to some of those folks, and they knew about Rand's background in Criminal Justice Reform and the things that I've spoken out on, we could have had agreement. But in that moment, it was just like this bloodthirsty mob and all I could think of was the man who was kicked in the head in Portland, you know, a week ago or the man whose jaw was broken or eight year old, Secoriea Turner. I really felt that we were going to lose our lives. I thought someone was going to throw a brick. I mean, it was the most terrifying moment in my entire life. CARLSON: So given that, let me just ask you quickly a follow up, Mrs. Paul, given that experience that you had, you just described it so vividly, what do you make of the news coverage of it? I've seen a couple of different accounts today that suggest it was not a big deal at all; that you're complaining for political reasons. NPR tonight described it as a peaceful protest. What do you make of that? K. PAUL: I'm furious. I am furious. I'm furious that Biden and Kamala Harris are not denouncing this. You tell me if you are surrounded by a mob that will not let you move, that is screaming in your face, that is holding you completely hostage and you cannot walk to your hotel and you are on a dark street, you tell me that's not violence. You tell me that is not an attack. CARLSON: That's right. R. PAUL: There were times, Tucker. CARLSON: I'm sorry, go ahead, Senator. R. PAUL: It happened incredibly quickly. You know, it's nearly one in the morning. We have two blocks. We think we can make it two blocks. It looks clear. We make it one block, and right about the time we see these policemen, we go up. We -- just as we approach the policeman, the mob turns the corner and they say, \"We've got him. We've got Rand Paul. We've got him trapped.\" Thirty people descend on us, but then 30 became 60, it became 90, it became 120 and it swelled. And we were in a pocket of -- Kelley and I and the two officers all touching each other in a very small pocket. They're completely surrounding us. They are pushing us. They are threatening to kill us. And they are yelling and screaming and -- K. PAUL: They are getting closer and closer at a point where we were inches -- R. PAUL: And I thought we were going to be overrun. And so I looked at the policeman and I yelled in his ear, I said, \"They know who I am. I'm in Congress.\" I don't think the policeman did know I was in Congress. And I said, \"They know -- you need to call for reinforcement,\" and he's calling for reinforcement. But even though there were thousands of policemen, it seemed like forever to come and we were there, but it was -- the pitch and the tenor of this as the invective, everything is getting louder and louder and louder. And I thought that we were going to be overrun. I mean, these police were brave, but there were two of them at first versus 120 people. If someone falls to the ground, that's when the mob begins kicking and stomping people and you're done for. But they came up. They were incredibly brave. The President has said this, and I'll say it again, they deserve our thanks, our praise. They deserve a medal, and I'll be there in the White House when the President gives them a medal for what they did, because I truly believe we would have been killed. The left says, oh, well, you weren't killed, so you weren't threatened. No, the police saved our lives because these thugs would have killed us. They would have stomped us and killed us and these people don't live in D.C. either. There's evidences coming out that these people were paid and that they came to town at someone else's behest. CARLSON: So why are we putting up with this? Why are we -- I mean, this is the most heavily fortified city in the United States. It is the seat of our Federal government. They don't own the streets. Most of them aren't even from there. Why are we -- why have we tolerated this crap for three months? I'm serious. We don't need to put up with this. Why are we? R. PAUL: Well, look at where the problems are -- Portland, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York. What do they all have in common? Democrat mayors, not just this time around, Democrat mayors for 50 years. And the thing is, the President put it very well in his speech last night. He said if you want the country to be Portland, if you want the country to be on fire, put somebody in the White House who doesn't care about whether we have police or not. The police are brave and they are protecting us. Are they for reforms? You know, me, Tucker, I'm for a lot of reforms for the police. I am for reforming them, but I never let myself forget that 99 percent of them or more are good people. They live amongst us. They go to our church. We see them in the grocery store. And if we want to make it out that they're all bad people, it's the same misnomer, the misrepresentation of saying, all white people are racist. We actually have less racism and prejudice than we've ever had in my lifetime. CARLSON: Of course. R. PAUL: We have been going in the right direction for so long. You look at Corporate America, you look at universities, you look at intermarriage, and you look at church integration. We are -- we have been going in the right direction. But now they're telling you that the world hates you and you might as well just break windows and take stuff instead of going to college and succeeding. It just -- it just boggles my mind where we're going. The violence has to stop. CARLSON: No, it does. Like, right -- like right now, and we can have those debates later once we make it safe to walk on streets that we pay for. Rand and Kelley Paul, thank you both very much. That was -- R. PAUL: Thank you. CARLSON: Compelling. I appreciate it. R. PAUL: Thank you. K. PAUL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, last night, Joe Biden voters in Washington physically assaulted and harassed Brandon Straka and another man. Straka is a former Democrat who founded the #Walkaway campaign to encourage others to leave the party as well. Here's what happened last night in D.C. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a (bleep). UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's fine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He likes your (bleep) right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You want him to stick that little sausage in you? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She called me a (bleep). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's what his (bleep) said. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You get away from me. You get away from me. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So that is what the left would call, \"The New York Times\" would call a hate crime, but only if it happened to someone they agreed with politically. They don't agree with the people in that video, so of course they ignored it completely. Keep in mind this is the same media establishment that jumped with all four paws on the Jussie Smollett hoax just last year. Remember that? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIGUEL ALMAGUER, NBC NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: There are many indications of a hate crime here. They are looking for two suspects who are apparently wearing Make America Great Again hats, though that has not yet been officially confirmed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The media has really cast so much doubt on his story, which I find so personally offensive that a gay black man is targeted, and then suddenly he becomes the victim of people's disbelief. BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN HOST: He said his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him. This is America in 2019. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: These people are such a loathsome fraud, such liars. They're saying nothing about this, of course. Brandon Straka is here tonight. He joins us live. Thanks so much for coming on. Tell us what happened, where you were and what these people said to you. BRANDON STRAKA, FOUNDER, #WALKAWAY CAMPAIGN: Sure. Thanks for having me, Tucker. So, I was a guest last night at the White House for the close of the R.N.C. Convention to watch President Trump's speech. It was a magical evening. Everything was absolutely incredible. Like something out of a storybook. I was there with a bunch of people from my organization, the #Walkaway Campaign and as I was leaving with two people, Mike Harlow, who is a fellow gay man and conservative activist and the ED of #Walkaway Libby Albert, we were exiting the Convention along with a large group of people and there was a small group of BLM hecklers there to harass people as they are walking out. The majority of the people exited and went to the right. The two friends of mine and I exited and we went to the left, which ended up being a big mistake. We were trying to get back to our hotel and as we were walking back to our hotel, four of the people who were with the BLM mob that was harassing the majority of the people as they were leaving, was walking down the street, crossing us as we were walking back to the hotel, and that's when they started hurling homophobic slurs at us, anti-gay slurs. And then they walked up to Mike Harlow, spit in his face. They threw a drink at me, threw a cup in my face. And then they actually hit Libby Albert, the girl who was with me. They called us the anti-gay F word about three or four times as you can see in that video. And I have to tell you, Tucker, I've endured anti-gay attacks like this actually, dozens of times in my life. It's been probably 10 years at least since something like this happened. What made this one feel really, really different was that this time, the attackers get to portray themselves as the victims. Back in the day when we would endure homophobic attacks, at least the people attacking didn't have the nerve to say that they were the victims. CARLSON: So that is such a good point. So, quickly, to all the well-meaning rich ladies with BLM signs on their front lawns, and to all the corporate HR departments who are allocating millions and millions of dollars to BLM, what would you say to them? STRAKA: Well, I would say that this is actually -- this is a group that just attacked two gay men. They've attacked people around the country violently. This is -- this is a violent group and they're a dangerous group. And if I just may say really, really quickly, too, because you brought up the Jussie Smollett thing, and the way the media covered that. I would like to ask some of those in media, gay people like Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon and Andy Cohen, do you have anything to say about the fact that two gay men were attacked last night by Black Lives Matter because you guys have been really supportive of this organization? I'd love to know what you think about that now that two people in your community were attacked by this organization. CARLSON: It's fair question. Brandon, thanks so much for coming on tonight. Appreciate it. STRAKA: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So in two weeks back to back, we had the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention. They weren't the same. We will show you just how different they were, just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well, the parties nominating conventions are over for the 2020 election cycle. They were essentially virtual. And amazingly, no one saw this coming from a production quality perspective. The Republicans won. The party of Hollywood lost. The Republican shot real fireworks, not bottle rockets. They found actual people to clap for their nominee. They didn't have to digitally insert anyone. They even managed to exit the convention without anyone getting hurt. All of these are big achievements in Democrat-run Washington. But how did the conventions compare on a substantive level? Well, Democrats insisted their convention would be light and uplifting and they hope you would take their word for it. Don't look too closely at the fine print. If you did happen to catch what they said from the podium though, you may have reached a different conclusion. Perpetually aggrieved Michelle Obama, for example, declared that America is a deeply racist country. She lectured America about this from her $12 million home on Martha's Vineyard, her summerhouse. Life is very hard for people who look like Michelle Obama said Michelle Obama. She didn't explain why she was broadcasting all of this from a mansion in one of the palest communities on Earth. But whatever. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: They see people calling the police on folks minding their own business just because of the color of their skin. They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protesters for a photo op. Sadly, this is the America that is on display for the next generation. A nation that is underperforming not simply on matters of policy, but on matters of character. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Is there anyone more privileged than that? And by the way, if you doubt her privilege, go read her thesis from Princeton, and ask yourself how did someone who wrote something this stupid wind up this famous? Anyway, she's telling you that the cages her husband built are bad now, throwing rocks and torturing churches is in fact peaceful protesting and by the way the country is racist. At the Republicans convention, by contrast, the Kentucky Attorney General Republican called Daniel Cameron was slightly more upbeat. He said he supported the President, according to Joe Biden, that means he's not black, but he did it anyway. And then he delivered what effectively amounted to a condemnation of identity politics. Here's part of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL CAMERON, KENTUCKY ATTORNEY GENERAL: They believe your skin color must dictate your politics and if you fail to conform while exercising your God-given right to speak and think freely, they will cut you. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Fundamental fairness. That might sound like a worthwhile goal for a civilized country. But laws and fairness, Barack Obama told us are in fact, expressions of bigotry. Destroying businesses and waking people up in the middle of the night because you don't like the way they look. That's fulfilling our country's dreams. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Americans of all races joining together to declare, in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state that black lives matter. No more, but no less. To the young people who led us this summer telling us we need to be better. In so many ways, you are this country's dreams fulfilled. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Another pompous rich person lecturing us. Someday we're going to do a dramatic reading of his wife's Princeton thesis by the way. It will take the whole hour, you'll enjoy it. But whatever. None of the rioting that these people are encouraging will ever get to where they live. There aren't going to be any riots on Martha's Vineyard. None of the low-income housing projects that Barack Obama wants to build in your neighborhood will ever be constructed in his neighborhood. Barack Obama knows that. Republicans know it, too. That's why one of the smartest programming moves of their convention, Republicans didn't simply give speaking slots to politicians, they brought in people like Mark and Patricia McCloskey, that's the couple from St. Louis who were terrorized in their own yard by a mob of Biden voters and were indicted for trying to defend themselves. They spoke to that convention. Here's part of what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK MCCLOSKEY, INDICTED FOR TRYING TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN ST. LOUIS: It seems as if the Democrats no longer view the government's job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): And the police aren't coming when you call in Democrat-run cities. They're already being defunded, disbanded. Blaming our best and allowing society's worst. VERNON JONES (D), GEORGIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: Democrats have turned their backs on our brave police officers. They call it defunding. Isn't it ironic that Democrat politicians have personal security to protect them, so why don't they forego their security and replace them with social workers, especially since that's what they want for you and me? (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Well, that's a great question. They're turning America into a genuinely dangerous country, but they're keeping their own bodyguards which you're paying for. Why are they doing that? Well, they didn't answer. Instead, they treated us to yet another lecture from entitled rich girl, Sandy Cortez. She did not grow up in the hood. She grew up in leafy Westchester. She has learned a lot from that experience. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Infidelity and gratitude to a mass people's movement working to establish 21st Century social, economic and human rights including guaranteed healthcare, higher education, living wages and labor rights for all people in the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: A mass people's movement, says Sandy Cortez of Westchester. That's what we need. Well, we've had quite a few mass people's movements around the world. One of them took place in Cuba in 1959. Maximo Alvarez grew up in Cuba. He lived through the world that Sandy Cortez would like to create. He fled to Florida to survive. He spoke at the Convention, really one of the best speeches of the R.N.C. Here's part of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAXIMO ALVAREZ, CUBAN IMMIGRANT: I heard the promises of Fidel Castro and I can never forget all of those who grew up around me, who look like me, who suffered and starved and died because they believed those empty promises. Those false promises: spread the wealth, free education, and free healthcare, defund the police, trust a socialist state more than your family and your community -- they don't sound radical to my ears. They sound familiar. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: They sound familiar. They do sound familiar. Trust the state more than you trust your own family. Yes. That is what they're telling you, by the way. That's the theme that runs through it. Make us more powerful. Turn over your lives to us. Look, we often attack the Republican Party and they deserve it, but when you get right down to it, there's a massive difference between the parties. The bedrock beliefs of the parties are not the same and that was the most obvious takeaway from the last two weeks. Well, over on CNN, the Governor of New York's brother has a primetime show. Is he the man he seems to be on TV? Well, secret tape recordings suggest no. He's a very different man from the one you see on TV. We'll explain, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Television is a famously phony medium. Grown men wear makeup to work. I hate to admit that, but it's true. But television also over time is revealing. If you watch long enough, you can tell who is real and who is fraudulent. Well, you're about to have all of your perceptions confirmed. Remember Michael Cohen? The President's former lawyer. The one who went to jail for tax evasion. Cohen was a committed sleaze ball. So it probably won't surprise you to learn that he was very friendly with a number of well-known media figures. Underneath it all, they had a lot in common. The unethical lawyer and the unethical talk show hosts. Cohen talked to all of them recently. Well, it turns out those conversations were tape recorded. The audio quality is excellent. Copies have been floating around for quite some time now. None has aired publicly yet. Who was he talking to? A lot of people. Chris Cuomo of CNN was one of them. Cohen and the Governor's brother had a pretty shocking conversation. Bottom line. Chris Cuomo is not the person he pretends to be on CNN. And there's more. This is developing story. We'll have all of it for you next week. Tune in. Well, prosecutors have charged 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse with murder. Two people were shot during the riots this week. One of the people who was there right at the scene. In fact, no one was closer was Richie McGinniss of \"The Daily Caller.\" Richie McGinniss was almost hit by a gunshot at one point. He was a critical witness to what has become a very controversial crime. He joins us tonight for details on what he saw. Richie, thanks so much. RICHIE MCGINNISS, \"THE DAILY CALLER\": Thanks for having me. CARLSON: So, you were -- we spoke to you the other day, but didn't quite understand just how close you were to the shooting. It turns out there may have been gunshots fired before the one that killed Joseph Rosenbaum. Tell us what you saw. MCGINNISS: Well, Tucker, I was just about 10 or 12 feet behind them as they ran into the parking lot. And what I saw was Rosenbaum pursuing Rittenhouse and Rittenhouse turned around. Now right before he turned around, I'm not sure if this was the reason why he turned around, but there was a gunshot. That's actually visible on video. It's not clear whether or not that gunshot was fired into the air or towards Rittenhouse, but Rittenhouse did turn around immediately after that. And at that point, he went from running away to aiming his weapon at Rosenbaum and I was actually directly behind Rosenbaum. So I took one or two steps to my right, right as Rosenbaum was lunging for the barrel of the rifle and he was that close to him and Rittenhouse actually took the barrel of the rifle and just dodged around, and at that point, as Rosenbaum was falling forward, he fired quickly four shots into Rosenbaum and at that point, I was only about 12, maybe 15 feet behind them, and I saw Rosenbaum fall to the ground. And at that point, my concern as I saw Rittenhouse runaway was to provide whatever aid I could to the man who I just saw gravely injured directly in front of me. But what I didn't realize until after, when I reviewed the video footage is that when Rittenhouse ran away, he actually ran around the car and back up behind me. I was kneeled on the ground over Rosenbaum. He was facedown and I was preparing to find out where the bullet holes were when a pair of legs arrived next to me and I just saw the legs, I didn't see anything else. And I said, \"What are you doing? Call 911.\" And I saw that individual grab the phone and put it up to their head, and I only found out later that that was actually Rittenhouse himself who had just shot Rosenbaum. And soon after that, he ran away and a bunch of other individuals arrived. We did our best to plug whatever wounds we saw on and somebody said that the hospital was just across the street. So I slung Rosenbaum's arm over my shoulder, his right arm, another individual took his left and then some others took his legs and one other man was holding my shirt actually on his head, and we took him to the hospital as quickly as we could. CARLSON: And he died. MCGINNISS: And he died. CARLSON: I mean, shots were fired before Rittenhouse fired. The guy he shot was trying to pull his gun out of his hands, and then we learn that another man he shot in the arm had a hand gun in his hand running at him with that, with the gun in his hand. Has that man been charged for attempted murder, do you know? MCGINNISS: Not that I know of, Tucker, but I did see that man actually in the hospital shortly after I arrived. He came through the emergency room waiting room with a couple of police officers and I saw his arm. And obviously, you can take a look at the damage. I won't describe it on television, but it was gruesome. CARLSON: Right. Yes. There's a lot about this story that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the story that we're reading in the newspapers, and since you are, to my knowledge, the most knowledgeable person about what happened since you were standing right there. I'm grateful that you came on tonight. Richie McGinniss, thank you from \"The Daily Caller.\" MCGINNISS: Thank you for having me. CARLSON: Well, Kentucky Fried Chicken is getting rid of its famous slogan, you can no longer lick your fingers. We'll tell you why. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, I used to serve fast food as a treat, but now, fast food is more than a once in a while thing. That's why I serve Kentucky Fried Chicken more and more. The kids love it and I know they're eating well. It's made from the highest quality chicken, cooked with the Colonel's finger licking good recipe of 11 herbs and spices. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Finger licking good. It's a very famous slogan. It's the latest victim of the pandemic. That slogan is gone now. Why can't we lick our fingers when we eat chicken? Dr. Marc Siegel is the Fox News medical contributor, author of the new book, \"COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science.\" Dr. Siegel joins us tonight. Hey, Doctor. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker. Let me tell you what the power of science says here. It says that you wash your hands before you eat a meal or after. But in terms of the chicken itself, when you cook it, you're killing all germs. So I don't care whether you eat it with a knife or fork. I don't care if you eat it with your fingers. You're not going to get COVID that way. So this is more about political posturing. And speaking of political posturing, we've seen that with a virtual Democratic National Convention, right? Where they say everything is virtual, but with protests, not so virtual, right? People up in their face, people by the way, you think you can social distance while you're burning down a building? I don't think so. I don't think you can do it when you're screaming without masks on. Now to be fair, we also saw the White House not enough masks, not enough social distancing. But that's hardly the same thing as what I just described with the hypocrisy going on with the Democratic National Convention. I think we need more consistency with public health here, Tucker. We need more consistency and we need it all across the country. Now, I have a suggestion tonight. I think when we get that rapid Abbott test that's coming out that we're going to have 50 million to 100 million doses of in October, I want to see a stand at every college, at every school, and every football game, let's put one at the protests, too. To let's test people and see what we can do about it -- Tucker. CARLSON: That's a great recommendation. Dr. Siegel, Thank you. SIEGEL: Thank you. CARLSON: So people have been rethinking a lot of their assumptions over the past couple of months, and one of them is, does any political party have an absolute monopoly on the loyalty of any one group or race? And that's a question that we're going to discuss with the business partner of Ice Cube, the filmmaker and rapper, right after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Do Americans have a moral obligation to vote for a political party based on the way they look? That is a question that is rarely asked, certainly not asked enough. But since it's an election season, we thought we would ask it. Jeff Kwatinetz has been thinking a lot about this. He's had a long career in the entertainment business, done a bunch of different things, including started a basketball -- a new basketball league. He is now a business partner with rapper, Ice Cube, and he joins us tonight. Jeff, thanks so much for coming on. JEFF KWATINETZ, COFOUNDER, BIG3: Thank you for having me. CARLSON: Does any party have a monopoly on the vote of a racial group? KWATINETZ: I think that the Democrats believe they have a monopoly. First, I just want to say, I'm not here to talk for black Americans. I'm here to talk to white Americans. And I think, Tucker, what we've seen on your show is there is a lot of chaos. There's a lot of unrest. There is a lot of frustration. And what we need is a vision for the future to actually go after the problems and not the symptoms. CARLSON: Amen. KWATINETZ: And when we've got -- yes, and we've got it two parties. Trump is arguing for law and order, which, whether we need law and order or not, it's addressing a symptom. And the Democrats are telling us that we just have to vote because we've got to get Trump out. And we'll get to the stuff to really get to the solutions after the election. And, you know, this election, the black vote can determine who wins, very clearly. And as you know, as we've talked about before, demographics are changing, that might not happen. That might not be true four years from now. CARLSON: That's right. KWATINETZ: So the whole idea of sit back and wait, and you'll get your turn. It's been 50 years since the Civil Rights, right? Today is the anniversary of the March on Washington. And the wealth gap, you know, between a black family's wealth and a white family's wealth has not changed since 1962. It actually went -- it actually got worse during Obama. So Democrats and Republicans both talk about how important Civil Rights and defeating racism is. I don't think either party has a monopoly on races. And I think that most people in America are not racist, and they want solutions. So someone has got to step up. Ice Cube put together a contract with black America that's a comprehensive solution. It has police reform, it has justice reform and prison reform, but it also has economic reforms to go to the root cause of the problem, and that's not what I hear either party is saying. CARLSON: Right. So, I mean, I wish I had more time because I think it's a really interesting and important subject. But it does seem to me sometimes that a lot of the things that politicians yell about are designed to keep us from talking about economics. KWATINETZ: I agree. I think that the politicians put forward a vision of fear. Look, no one's happy. Everyone is screaming on every network. Everyone is talking about how the other party and the other -- and this is up and down the ballot, and people are talking about how, you know, mayhem and the end of the world will happen if the other party wins. Instead of, why not come up with something that's exciting, that's bold and that gets people instead of worrying about suppressing the black vote and suppressing votes from white people who believe in Civil Rights like I do. I think a lot of Democrats talk like they do. CARLSON: Jeff, I appreciate your coming on the show tonight. It is an interesting, interesting point and one that's not made often enough, it should be about actual solutions, not just posturing. Thanks for saying that. KWATINETZ: Yes, well, let me just say one last thing. John F. Kennedy said those who don't allow peaceful revolutions to happen make -- CARLSON: We are out of time.

            "article_content": "Former governor of Arkansas and ordained minister, Mike Huckabee, reacts to a Black Lives Matter activist's call to take down all images of \"white Jesus.\" Far-left activist Shaun King on Monday said all images depicting Jesus as a \u201cwhite European\u201d should be torn down because they are a form of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d King made his remarks over a series of Twitter posts as historic monuments and statues have become the targets of anger and vandalism during Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death while in police custody late last month. \u201cYes I think the statues of the white European they claim is Jesus should also come down. They are a form of white supremacy. Always have been,\u201d King tweeted. \u201cIn the Bible, when the family of Jesus wanted to hide, and blend in, guess where they went? EGYPT! Not Demark. Tear them down.\u201d King followed the post up with another, saying that \u201cwhite Jesus is a lie\u201d and a \u201ctool of white supremacy\u201d created to help white people use Christianity as a \u201ctool of oppression.

This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" July 20, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" We were off last week. It's good to be back. One thing we learned while gone is that America's national parks are outstanding. They are tremendous. So most of the time, by the way, is our interstate highway system. We should be proud of all of those things. But in the end, the real reason that we have a government, the only reason really is so that we can live in peace. You pay your taxes -- a lot of taxes -- in order to keep your family safe from chaos. That's the bottom line, so you can drive your kids to school without getting carjacked, or walk to the supermarket without worrying about being raped. When a violent mob shows up in front of your house and threatens to kill you, you know that you can call the police and they will come to your defense. That's what you pay for. That's what government is for. The rest of it is just extra. For centuries that has been the deal that we strike with our leaders and everyone knows it. But suddenly out of nowhere, they have changed the rules on us. When the mob came for Mark and Patricia McCloskey in St. Louis a few weeks ago, they called the police with that expectation, but the police never came. You're looking at their smashed fence. They had no choice but to defend themselves. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] CARLSON: The McCloskeys were exercising the most basic right of all: the ancient and immutable right to self-defense. You'd think they would be lauded for that, but they haven't been, they've been attacked. The prosecutor in St. Louis, the totally politicized Kim Gardner promised to retaliate against the McCloskeys for daring to defend themselves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIM GARDNER, ST. LOUIS COUNTY CIRCUIT ATTORNEY: I am disturbed by the events that occurred over this weekend, where there were peaceful protesters who were met with guns in a violent assault. Since learning of these events over this weekend, I will work with the public and the police to investigate these tragic events. I will use every extent of Missouri law to hold individuals accountable. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: What you just heard was a lie. Every word of it. The crowd wasn't peaceful. They barged onto private property, destroyed a fence and threatened to kill strangers, the McCloskeys. The McCloskeys did nothing wrong. They did what they had to do and what you would have to do in similar circumstances. But the prosecutor wasn't kidding. Self-defense is no longer allowed in places controlled by people like her, the left. This afternoon she followed through with her threat and she charged the McCloskeys with the unlawful use of a weapon. In the State of Missouri that's a felony. The police have already seized their firearms. They also searched McCloskey's home. Once again, the McCloskeys are under attack, not simply from a politicized prosecutor, but from the entire media establishment. Here's a taste. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRITTANY PACKNETT CUNNINGHAM, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S 21ST CENTURY POLICING TASK FORCE: The McCloskeys are not an aberration. They are not an anomaly. They are not crazy and they are not random. They are a product of their environment, because the American environment prioritizes white people, white wealth and white land at the expense of all others, no matter how many black folks, poor folks or indigenous folks have to suffer along the way. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These cases are part of a disturbing pattern in this country of white people, including some who clearly love their guns as much as they love their privilege, threatening the lives of black people for doing the most basic everyday activities. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Grotesque. These people are monsters. And in point of fact, the mob was not black. It was mixed race. There were white people and black people. It had nothing to do with race. And the basic everyday activities you just heard about, those include unlawful trespassing, destruction of property, terroristic threatening, threatening to kill them. But none of the people who did that will face consequences for it. Mark McCloskey will though. He now faces four years in prison and up to a $10,000.00 fine for the crime of defending himself when no one else would. Mark McCloskey joins us tonight. Mark, thanks so much for coming on. I can't imagine how you feel like you've woken up in a country you don't recognize. Tell us where you are right now legally, if you would. MARK MCCLOSKEY, PROSECUTED FOR DEFENDING HIS HOME: Well, it's a totally upside down world, Tucker. The people that broke into my neighborhood, they're all trespassing. The guy that recruited it, that planned this event, said the next day that he intended to break the law, that it was his -- he needed to break laws in order to send his message. None of those people are arrested. None of those people are charged. The prosecutor, the Circuit Attorney has apparently decided that her job as a prosecutor isn't to keep us safe from criminals, but to keep the criminals safe from us. It's a bizarre upside down world. I've been a little irritated by this process until today, and I am just flat out pissed off. I mean, this has gotten to be outrageous. CARLSON: Well, you should be afraid, too. I mean, the force of the state is coming down on you for exercising the most basic right that exists. It's a natural right, the right of self-defense. Are you going to stay in a place that seeks to put you in prison for defending yourself? MCCLOSKEY: You know, everybody has to stand up and do what's right and I'm not going to be bullied. I'm not going to be intimidated. The left, the mob uses social intimidation and threats to get people to knuckle under and apologize for doing what's right, and we're not going to apologize for doing what's right. We're not going to back down and we're not going to move. People need to stand up, wake up and recognize this for what it is. It's a concerted effort to destroy our way of life, to change the fundamental basic social contract, to do away with capitalist democracy and replace it with mob rule, encouraging violence, protecting the criminals and prosecuting people that try to defend themselves against it. It's a bizarre-o world. It's time for people to wake up and pay attention to it. CARLSON: Has anyone explained what you were supposed to do in a situation where the police would not respond. They would not come to protect you despite the fact you pay them. And private security wouldn't come either probably for fear of being sued. What were you supposed to do once people break in and start threatening you? MCCLOSKEY: Well, you know like what various commentators have suggested is, we should have just gone inside and filmed them with our cell phones. Well, do you want to have 300 people inside your house breaking stuff, setting fires and killing you? Or would you rather stop them when they're outside? We chose to stop them from coming in. CARLSON: What's going to happen now? I mean, do you have a fear of going to prison? MCCLOSKEY: You know, I don't know. I've had very little familiarity with the criminal process. We've gotten support now from the White House and the House on down. Governor Parsons and the Senator, Eric Schmidt, our Attorney General, it seems like the only person in the United States that thinks we did something wrong is our Circuit Attorney. But she is the same person that let out of jail everybody that was responsible for the looting and fires and destruction, following the George Floyd death in the City of St. Louis. The only people that she wants to prosecute are the people that defended themselves against it, and nobody else to my knowledge. CARLSON: So you've been a target of crime. You haven't backed down. You've gone on television repeatedly. People know where you live and the state has now confiscated your firearm so you can't protect yourself. On what grounds did they do that? Those were legally registered as far as I understand. MCCLOSKEY: Yes, I guess within the technicality of the laws, they have to determine whether or not the weapons were readily capable of being, you know, fatal or causing serious bodily harm, and so they have to take them and test them and that sort of thing. And there'll be some revelations that will come out about that, but the bottom line is that, you know, the police I've said this before, the police who came out that issued the warrant, didn't want to have to do it. They knew that they're just doing their job. They were very polite about it. But nonetheless, you're right. I mean, they present the mob terror door and then strip us of our ability to defend against it. CARLSON: It's almost unbelievable. I appreciate your coming on tonight and Godspeed to you and your wife and we'll be following this of course. Mark McCloskey, thank you. MCCLOSKEY: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, it's been nearly two months since widespread rioting broke out across the United States and it's still going in some places. On Friday night, thousands of rioters swarmed the Christopher Columbus statue in the City of Chicago. Newly released aerial footage shows men dropping off weapons for the rioters who later attacked the police. The police were vastly outnumbered by them. Black clad rioters used umbrellas as shields and formed a line to march to the crowds. They pelted the police with rocks. They threw bottles at them. In the end, 18 police officers were injured, but only a handful of rioters were arrested. Meanwhile, in the City of Seattle, a beautiful place that's completely out of control, rioters brawled with police and destroyed more businesses over the weekend. Here's part of it. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] CARLSON: Two hundred miles to the south of Seattle in Portland, Oregon, another beautiful city destroyed by the mob. Violent mayhem continued. It's been going on for eight straight weeks. Two hundred miles to the south of Seattle in Portland, Oregon, another beautiful city destroyed by the mob. Violent mayhem continues. It's been going on for eight straight weeks. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] CARLSON: Political leaders in Portland are doing nothing to stop this. In fact, they're affirmatively taking the side of the rioters. This is the armed wing of the Democratic Party. These are their militia. They're blaming the police for the violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to also remind you that the police and the F.B.I. have always put provocateurs in crowds for movement. Right? Always. There's always been police acting as if there are community members trying to start trouble. Right? Because it gives them the authority to brutalize us. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: That's one way of looking at it. Jason Rantz is a Seattle based radio host. He joins us tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. You'll notice in the last clip we played, the politician described the rioters as quote \"us.\" It does seem like many politicians in the Pacific Northwest, Democrats feel that these mobs are their supporters. JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: They are. This is the base that keeps these people in power. And it's not just in the Pacific Northwest. It's all across the country. We're seeing it unfold in Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, D.C. These are folks who are believers in the cause. Now maybe some of them don't support the actual violence, but God forbid they actually speak out against the violence because then they believe they're doing a disservice to their cause. And so instead of acknowledging what's going on, you have these spineless politicians who want to pretend that oh, no, it's totally peaceful. I don't know what you're talking about. Any of the violence is being done by the cops, although in that case with Portland with that clip, Antifa members are literally saying they were responsible for the violence against the police union office that they tried to burn down. This is not some provocateurs in the crowd doing this. In Seattle, you had a bunch of people who were basically marauding around town. They were going towards every single Starbucks and Walgreens and different businesses trying to destroy them. This has nothing to do with George Floyd. This has everything to do with a devious ideology that's pushing Marxism and socialism. And the only way that they can get that is to break down the current systems of governance, of capitalism, of policing, and rebuild. And if they want to rebuild, they believe they have to get violent and if not violent, they have to give the threat of violence to stop people from actually speaking up. CARLSON: The cowardice and the complicity of elected officials is awe inspiring. If these were Trump voters, armed, assaulting police officers, civilians, burning things, destroying property, tearing down statues, wrecking stores, looting, do you think -- would you stand by and say, you know, I roughly agree with these people politically, so I'm not going to say anything about it. Or would you stand up and tell the truth about it? RANTZ: Yes, you stand up and you tell the truth. This whole idea that you've got to just say few bad apples in a larger group that's otherwise peaceful. I'm sorry, but if I'm part of a movement, and you've got 20, 30, 40 people who are turning to violence for over 50 days in Portland, I'm not showing up and give credence to that movement. I'm going to identify it for what it is. And too often, all across the country, whether it's Portland, Seattle, Chicago or Atlanta, you've got a lot of people who are sitting back and saying, you know what, we are the silent majority, we're going to fight back. I'm sorry, it is unacceptable to remain the silent majority. We need to stand up. We need to be the vocal majority and we need to start pushing back. It is unacceptable that we're allowing this kind of lawlessness take over American cities, and kudos to the Trump administration for sending in the Federal law enforcement officials in Portland, hopefully soon in Chicago and hopefully soon in Seattle, because if the city governments aren't going to step up, we can't sit back and allow this kind of nonsense. That's how you lose elections on a local level, staying silent. Right now all of these protesters, they're not silent, are they? They're organizing. They're out there and they are recruiting members to their cause. Meanwhile, we're saying, oh, maybe I'll send out an angry tweet. It's got to be a little bit more than that. We need to get organized. CARLSON: Yes. Because what you're watching is the Biden campaign in action, actually. So yes, it's hard to know the answers, but I can't resist asking it. We've got an election in a few months in November. Does this just stop then? I mean, does Portland to Seattle to Chicago to Atlanta to Minneapolis, do these places ever go back to normal? When does this end? RANTZ: The fear is that this is the new normal. And that's why we need to start speaking up and getting a little bit more engaged. Those of us regardless of our political positions, simply deem it unacceptable to tear down cities, burn buildings down, or riot and loot. If you don't stand up. Why do you think -- why does anyone think this is going to stop? Violence begets violence, lawlessness begets lawlessness, regardless of the city. CARLSON: That's exactly right. That is absolutely a wise observation and always true. Jason Rantz, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. RANTZ: Thank you so much. CARLSON: A lot of bad news about the Wuhan coronavirus this last month, but tonight, we have some good news. Dr. Siegel is standing by with the very latest on that. Plus, Kanye West opened up his presidential bid with a rally in South Carolina. It's actually a lot more interesting than you would have imagined. We will play some of it for you. Adam Carolla is here to react to what he said. That's all straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: A lot of news recently about a resurgence of the Wuhan coronavirus here in the United States. You're starting to hear some politicians suggest we may need another round of lockdowns, at least until the election. But that question may be moot because researchers in the U.K. claim they have developed a viable vaccine for the coronavirus. We turn for details as we always do to Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel. He has been following this for us. Hey, Doctor. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, this is really big news tonight. I am optimistic about this and this Oxford University vaccine which is a very modern vaccine using genetic material, using a different kind of a virus from a chimpanzee to bring the payload in that actually starts the war against the coronavirus and that's what we're talking about here, Tucker. It is a war. But I've never described the war to you this way before. It's a war in the bloodstream, a war of our immune cells fighting a virus. And if a vaccine works, the vaccine causes those immune cells to be revved up. And the immune cells that we've always talked about are the B cells that make antibodies. We're talking antibodies, antibodies, antibodies. And this vaccine actually does make those antibodies. They studied a thousand volunteers, half of them got a meningitis vaccine, the other half got this vaccine. And they found that the people that got this vaccine made the antibodies that we need called neutralizing antibodies to neutralize the virus. But there's a bigger story here, Tucker. It's a cell I never talked about before. It's called a T-cell. Those are the real immune warriors against the virus and they never of course, get top billing right? The T-cells. What does T-cell do? First of all, one kind of T-cell aids those antibodies in attacking the virus. It's called a helper cell. The other one, the most prodigious powerful cell in the human body is a natural killer cell. It deserves the name. It literally attacks the virus and kills it. And you know what they found with this vaccine? At 14 days and 28 days, they found an abundance of those antibodies, an abundance of those T-cells, a great marker of immunity. We have to see how this goes over the several weeks and months and now it will be tried in 30,000 people around the world. This is very positive news that we're going to have a working vaccine here, Tucker. The Oxford vaccine with AstraZeneca involved. Very, very, very promising. CARLSON: Wow. And unexpected. Dr. Siegel, thank you for that report. Appreciate it. SIEGEL: Follow the science, Tucker, not the politics, the science tonight. CARLSON: That has been our view and yours from the first day. Thanks a lot. Ghislaine Maxwell is incarcerated and a friend says she fears for her life in prison. Why would that be in the United States? A fascinating story about which we don't know everything. A live report is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Prosecutors have refused to let Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the closest associates of Jeffrey Epstein out on bail so she remains confined tonight -- incarcerated. Now, one of her friends says she fears for her life in Federal custody. Fox's chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has been on the story since the beginning and he joins us tonight with an update. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker, that family friend of Ghislaine Maxwell tells the U.S. newspaper that Maxwell believes Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his prison cell and fears that she will meet the same fate. Despite Epstein's death being ruled as suicide, it did happen under questionable circumstances like the fact that he was taken off suicide watch days before he died, surveillance cameras near his cell were faulty, and guards falsified records to make it appear as if they were checking on Epstein every few hours. Fox News is also reporting that Ghislaine Maxwell feared for her life long before she was taken into custody and that she was guarded round the clock by former members of the British military, bought her New Hampshire estate in cash, and when the F.B.I. finally showed up to arrest her, she fled into a safe room within the compound though she was quickly found. When she first entered the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn Prison, officials placed her on suicide watch and gave her paper sheets and clothing so she could not harm herself. Now, she is reportedly wearing normal clothing and being moved from cell to cell for her safety, sometimes with roommates, sometimes not. Maxwell's attorneys are also concerned about her health, saying the COVID- 19 risk inside the prison is very high. But those who accuse Ghislaine Maxwell of grooming them to be the underage sex slaves of Jeffrey Epstein, say the fact that she is in prison makes them believe they are finally on the right path -- Tucker. CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks so much for that. GALLAGHER: Sure. CARLSON: We'll see if we're on the right path. Why did she come back to this country? Exactly. She's not stupid, and she's rich. We'll find out. Meanwhile, Kanye West is running for President. He launched his campaign at a rally in South Carolina last night. His remarks were not focus grouped. There weren't a lot of platitudes or cliches. They were as unusual, in fact, as eccentric as the man himself, but in some ways, they were remarkable and worth watching. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANYE WEST, AMERICAN ARTIST: Freedom does not come from an election. Freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas Station. It has nothing to do with this election. It only has to do with God and God's people. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: A celebrity musician telling you that freedom does not come from porn or drugs or pulling a gun on people. It comes from God. Here you have one of the most famous people in the world attacking the porn industry and Big Pharma in one speech. He said a lot of things by the way, some of them we wouldn't agree with at all. Some very unusual proposals made the roster, too, including giving a million dollars to any woman who has a baby. But it was interesting. And maybe the most arresting moment came when Kanye West talked about abortion. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEST: My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy. I almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Well, there's a moment. That's something you probably haven't seen before because of course, it's never happened. A Grammy Award winning musician, making an appeal, an emotional appeal against abortion, but he was just starting. Then he told the crowd about the time he and his wife considered on abortion themselves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEST: She had the pills in her hand. You know those pills, where you take the pills? And if you take it, it's a wrap. The baby is gone. And I called my wife, and she said, \"We're going to have this baby.\" I said, \"We're going to have this child.\" I know people that are 50 years old that didn't have children, that didn't have that child, that have never got to experience the level of joy that I experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to, she stood up and she protected that child. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: No speech writer wrote that, and it's a dangerous point if you think about it. They can say they love you. They can tell you your life matters. But if they clutter your neighborhood with abortion clinics, they're lying. That's a real argument. But no one wanted to engage it, of course, and so they called him crazy. And by the way, maybe he is, but it's still a point worth talking about. Instead, TMZ reported that many people in Kanye West's circle believe he needs, quote, \"serious help,\" and then cited an anonymous family member who explained that he is experiencing a bipolar episode. And by the way, maybe he is. We don't know. But it doesn't mean what he said is wrong. Over on CNN, of course, they were horrified by it. Call him crazy as quick as you can before anyone pays attention to what he is saying. Some guy called Dean Obeidallah tweeted, quote, \"This is a human being in dire need of help.\" As if he cares, but help for what? For believing that pornography is bad for you? A form of bondage? For encouraging people to get off prescription pills? For getting emotional as you talk about considering aborting your own child? That's all crazy? Huh. Then what's seen exactly? David Webb hosts a radio show on Sirius XM. He seems sane. We're happy to have him on tonight. David Webb, great to see you. I just -- I just want to be clear. You know, I'm not a shrink. I have no idea what Kanye West's mental state is. And I think there are probably a lot of things Kanye West believes that I don't believe at all. But he makes points that almost nobody I've ever seen on a campaign podium has made and why isn't anyone talking about those points? DAVID WEBB HOSTS, RADIO SHOW, SIRIUS XM: Because, Tucker, to your point, they don't want to talk about issues. Look, I'm with you. I'm not going to diagnose Kanye. I have nothing against Kanye. Matter of fact, I find him entertaining. In this stream of consciousness that he spoke about and the various things and like you said, some of the outrageous things like a million dollars, you know, for every baby being born, well, there's another side of that, I would say, teach them birth control, give them sex education. It will cost you less than a million bucks. And I think you and I can agree on the fiscal conservatism of that. But he talks about things that Hollywood hypocrites uses political wedges, as political pawns for ideas and uses them against the people who dare stand up against them. Like Dean Obeidallah. He is -- first of all, ignore him. Kanye has a right to say what he says whether we agree with it or not. I think you agree with that. And he has a right to do whatever he wants, if he wants to make a public display and a public appeal. I think his words about abortion, his words about not taking drugs, about you know -- about guns. He's right. Good people with good guns aren't the problem. Bad people with bad guns are, but then again, I don't understand why he says, we are a nation of white supremacists, which we're not. I think we're just dealing with a stream of consciousness from a public figure and I think some interesting things could be discussed. I'd love to sit down with him and do that. CARLSON: I think a million dollars is, you know, a lot for a child. I did it for free. Most people do. But I do think it's so interesting to hear you have a public figure, saying that children are the most important thing in life in the world. You know, there's nothing more important than children. And he means it. And he is immediately -- and he's totally right, of course, and he is immediately dismissed as a mental patient. Has that become that controversial statement to CNN? Maybe it has. WEBB: Unfortunately for some, it has, but Tucker, think about it. If we work hard in life to achieve wealth, to achieve station, status, or even if no matter who you are, you achieve something in life, who do you leave it to? Do you leave statues? Do you leave your belongings? No, you have children. They are your true legacy. Kanye gets this, which, by the way, hallmark of the black community in America was always the legacy of your children doing better than you did, coming out of tough times. Think about the importance of children to our society. CARLSON: I wonder -- I mean, how many poor people at the end of their lives say, I just had too many children. Compare that to the number who don't you know, for whom that's all that matters, like in the end, is there anything else that matters really? I doubt many poor people at the end say I just had too many kids. There's just too much love in my family. WEBB: No, it's absolutely true, Tucker. I mean, come on. America, look around you. The joys of having a family and community, it doesn't come from someone who doesn't procreate. It comes from someone who puts something on this planet that goes on to make it a better place and that's what Kanye is talking about when he talks about children, when he talks about his life being saved instead of being aborted. CARLSON: I'd be a lot more enthusiastic about voting Republican if some of them talk like that once in a while. David Webb, great to see you. WEBB: Well, we just did and I'm a Republican. So there you go. CARLSON: You've heartened me. Great to see you tonight. Thank you. WEBB: Great to see, Tucker. CARLSON: Adam Carolla, up next. Kanye West, sort of a hero, a semi-hero for some social conservatives, anyway, that's unexpected. His view just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: The administration tonight is pledging to dispatch hundreds of Federal agents to quell rising violence in the City of Chicago. They say that'll happen later this week. Department of Homeland Security says it's sending 150 agents there to help other Federal officials crack down on crime. Crime in Chicago is spiraling out of control and that's not overstatement. Just this Friday, more than a dozen police officers were injured at a coordinated riot around a Christopher Columbus statue in formerly placid downtown Chicago. Then over the weekend, 63 people were shot in Chicago, 12 of them were killed. Another weekend of record setting violence. Many of those shootings by the way happened in broad daylight. We can definitively say that there are people alive tonight who will be dead next week in Chicago. It is a tragedy. What are the city's leaders doing about it? Nothing. The Mayor of Chicago, a total incompetent called Lori Lightfoot, is instead feuding with the administration in promoting a fictional census cowboy character in order to boost her city's population count in this year's census. People are fleeing Chicago -- taxpayers, especially. It's been to the great benefit of nearby Wisconsin. If you live in the area, you know. But Lightfoot is pretending it's not happening and trying to divert attention to an argument that she is having with the President. She just told MSNBC she'll do all she can to stop the administration from sending Federal law enforcement agents including a lawsuit. It's insane. Insanity. So if you're looking for original thinking or bravery or integrity, obviously you're not looking to Hollywood or the music industry. There's none of that there. Most famous people march in perfect lockstep with the current cultural trends, whatever they are. So it's unusual to see a genuinely famous person like Kanye West, openly defying the orthodoxy, but he has. Adam Carolla has been there for many years. He knows what it's like to think freely in the middle of Los Angeles as a famous person. He's the author of a new book, \"I'm Your Emotional Support Animal,\" which by the way he is. Adam Carolla joins us tonight. Adam, thanks a lot for coming on. What do you -- without endorsing all that Kanye West said -- I am not even aware of all that he said or endorsing Kanye West as a person. What do you make of someone that famous saying things that unpopular? ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN AND AUTHOR: You know, I always like this saying which is mine, which is, everyone knows there's something called FU money, but he has F me money. He has so much money that he can say whatever he wants, even if it's to his detriment. And whether you agree with it or not, I find it refreshing that someone is just speaking their mind. I had a really scary moment this morning, not physically scary, but like fundamentally scary, spiritually scary. I did a radio interview this morning, and the guy said to me sort of off the air under his breath. He said, you're lucky. You do a podcast. You can say whatever you want. And I thought, wait a minute, it's 2020. This is the United States, you're a broadcaster. You can't say whatever you want? The notion that people with microphones that are broadcasting are lamenting they can't say whatever they want in America in 2020 is scary. CARLSON: Does it occur to them -- clearly, it doesn't, but why it doesn't, is that they have a moral obligation to say what they think is true, not always to be right, because we're people, we're often wrong. But to do your best to tell the truth, what happened to that idea? CAROLLA: I don't know. You know, my book outsold eight books that made \"The New York Times\" bestseller list a couple of weeks ago, but I was not included on that list. So maybe speaking your mind is not a great financial move. Maybe talking about the fragility of white people or Black Lives Matter. maybe that's a better way to get paid in this city. CARLSON: Oh, you got beaten by \"White Fragility.\" Probably the worst book I've ever read. And I say that as someone who has read a lot of bad books. So, I've got to ask you about this since you are in the State of California, I think of you as informally our California correspondent. The state is currently experiencing a second round of coronavirus shutdowns. How have you been weathering them? CAROLLA: Like I weathered the first round, got up, hugged my kids and went to work. I'm going to be in Dallas this weekend doing shows. I'll be back in Texas the week after that. I just get about my life. It's too short. The man has a different set of rules every 10 minutes. I wear a mask when I go into the Home Depot. Other than that, I'm figuring things out for myself and I'm living my life. I'm not in a -- I'm not compromised. Maybe a little mentally, some may argue, but I'm living my life. And I want to say a quick thank you to your viewers, Tucker, because after my last appearance on your show a few weeks ago, my book sold out on Amazon the following morning, literally, 15,000 copies gone because of your audience. CARLSON: They're a loyal audience. Not many people telling the truth right now and you're one of them. I noticed by the way you called me from Texas the other day. You're spending a lot of time in Texas. Do you think, in say, three years, you or any of your neighbors will still be in California? CAROLLA: No, I don't think so. I feel like everybody in California that pays their taxes, that plays by the rules, that raises their kids, that is community based, you get punished. And if you are an empty bag and you've come here and you're here illegally, you do whatever you want, do it all with impunity, live on the streets, shoot up, you know, defecate wherever, they'll keep walking. The cops won't do anything. But the City and the Mayor have it in for you. If you're a taxpayer and a good citizen, then you get punished. And so I think good people can take being punished for a couple of years, but they can't take the life sentence that is California. So I'll probably end up moving to Texas and calling you from my full time residence. CARLSON: There's going to be a big reshuffling in this country very soon and you are on the cutting edge as always. Congrats on the book. Adam Carolla, thank you for that. CAROLLA: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, all of a sudden, the media have ripped off the mask and they're supporting violence as a political tactic. They spent the last few months describing the riots as mostly peaceful. They've provided cover for rioting. They've watched conservative speakers shut down, their families harassed. Now \"The New York Times\" is planning a new hit on this show. We will tell you what the story is after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: One more thing before we go tonight. Since this show began almost four years ago, I've really tried not to talk about myself on the air or even use the first person pronoun. The last thing this country needs is more narcissism. It's not very interesting anyway, people who use the word I a lot tend to bore everyone, but themselves. But tonight we're going to make an exception to that rule. We don't have much choice. Last week, \"The New York Times\" began working on a story about where my family and I live. As a matter of journalism, there is no conceivable justification for a story like that. The paper is not alleging we've done anything wrong, and we haven't. We pay our taxes. We like our neighbors. We've never had a dispute with anyone. So why is The New York Times doing a story on the location of my family's house? Well, you know why? To hurt us. To injure my wife and kids so that I will shut up and stop disagreeing with them. They believe in force. We've learned that. Two years ago, a leftwing journalist publicized our home address in Washington, a group of screaming Antifa lunatics showed up while I was at work. They vandalized our home. They threatened my wife. She called 911 while hiding in a closet. A few weeks later, they showed up again at our house. For the next year, they sent letters to our home threatening to kill us. We tried to ignore it, it felt cowardly to sell our home and leave. We raised our kids there in the neighborhood, and we loved it. But in the end, that's what we did. We have four children. It just wasn't worth it. But The New York Times followed us. The paper has assigned a political activist called Murray Carpenter to write a story about where we are now. They've hired a photographer called Tristan Spinski to take pictures. Their story about where we live is slated to run in the paper this week. Editors there know exactly what will happen to my family when it does run. I called them today and I told them, but they didn't care. They hate my politics. They want this show off the air. If one of my children gets hurt because of a story they wrote, they won't consider it collateral damage. They know it's the whole point of the exercise, to inflict pain on our family, to terrorize us, to control what we say. That's the kind of people they are. They'll deny this, of course. They'll claim it's just journalism, just the facts. Really? So how would Murray Carpenter and his photographer Tristan Spinki feel if we told you where they live? If we put pictures of their homes on the air? What if we publicize the home address of every one of the soulless robot editors at The New York Times who assigned and managed this incitement to violence against my family? What about the media editor Jim Windolf? We could do that. We know who they are. Would that qualify as journalism? We doubt they'd consider it journalism. They'd call it criminal behavior if we did it and that tells you everything. It does tell you everything. That's about it for us tonight. Tomorrow night, we're going to have pretty amazing footage of drones in China. The Chinese government loading ethnic minorities into train cars shipping them off to reeducation camps, remember as the NFL franchises and woke mega corporations chastise you for your systemic racism and your white fragility, they are completely silent on what is happening in China. In fact, they're benefiting from it. So tune in tomorrow night and every night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. From New York, the great Sean Hannity, next. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I am Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle. From Washington tonight in moments, Candace Owens will tell us what the congressional black caucus has gotten all panicked about? And I'm going to take you also inside the privileged lives of some of the country's most deranged rioters. You won't believe what they look like. But first, Dems declare war on fun. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. Does Joe Biden look like he is having fun to you? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It seems to me that there is things can and should change, because for the first time, unions are respected more. My father was around the General Motors agency, he didn't own it, but he ran it. And there's cars and cars and cars. Everything they've done has been designed-- the fact is that Wall Street investors didn't build this country. We're only about, I don't know, how many days out, but less than two months. This idea of \"Slow Joe,\" anyway, I shouldn't laugh about it because - anyway. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK. That's just from the last few days. He kind of reminds me of an elderly person who is being dragged around by relatives to events that he neither has the energy nor the interest in attending. He just looks miserable, and his handlers and backers want the rest of us to be miserable, too. Pelosi, Schumer, Cuomo, De Blasio, Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland, Lori Lightfoot in Chicago, how much joy have they been spreading lately? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Sad time. So much going on in my state of California, and then we have the sadness of Kenosha. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The Republicans are the enemy of the good. MAYOR TED WHEELER (D-OR), PORTLAND: They are not wanted here. We haven't asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Any school that goes over 100 COVID-19 positive cases is going can be closed down to do remote learning. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: At some point, all of these characters who are pulling the strings in the Biden puppet show, they forgot that our declaration of independence guarantees not just life and liberty, but also the pursuit of happiness. Now, those rights are inalienable, meaning government can't take them away, or at least shouldn't be able to take them away. Yet everywhere you look in blue state America, they are trying to keep you from living, from exercising your freedom, from deciding your own path to happiness. Oh, sorry, unless you are rioting against Trump and systemic racism, in which case, you are free to set fires, beat people up, harass diners and restaurants, or harass suburbanites as they sleep. Now, I actually remember when California was fun. Under liberal Gavin Newsom, though, they have gone from surfing USA to shut in USA. Remember the hustle and bustle of New York City? Broadway, the gallows, the New York City marathon, the hop in restaurant scene. How many 'I love New York' t- shirts are those vendors selling these days? Democrats are like perpetual bad parents. They treat everyone like children and ground us for absolutely no reason at all. And these super-spreaders of despair absolutely hate the fact that Americans in red states refuse to submit and they have chosen to live their lives, to go to school, to play sports, to go to work, and attend church on Sunday. The latest lie of the anti-fun coalition is from a study claiming that the Sturgis motorcycle rally last month in South Dakota was a reckless COVID spreading event that resulted in 250,000 cases. Well, in reality, state officials could only trace 260 cases to the biking event, and egregious and oft-repeated lie goes unchecked. But the media, they don't care about pesky facts and irritating inconvenient data. They merely exist to echo these kinds of malicious falsehoods to damage Trump and his allies. And they do all they can to ensure that fun is no longer an option for Americans. So why are they doing this? Because it's the opposite of Trump's plan. Just look at how much fun Trump and his voters were having tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Open up your state, madam governor. Open up your state. And tell your governor to open up your state. Let's play Big Ten football, right? Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb? I don't think so. Say darling, who moved in next door? Oh, it is a resident of Antifa. No, thank you. Let's get out of here. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, when you looked at the faces in the crowd, these people were there because they wanted the freedom to pursue their own happiness, and they were enjoying themselves. But Democrats, they hate this scene. These are people living their lives. They want to make all your decisions for you. It is all about power and all about control. They've worked hard to shut down schools, shutdown sports, and they have proclaimed now that football is not essential. Well, parents and players in Connecticut, my old home state, disagree. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (Chanting \"Let Us Play\") (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Yesterday, these high schoolers and parents finally decided enough is enough and delivered a powerful message to liberal governor Ned Lamont. It's too bad they can't all move to Texas. We'll talk about that issue later on in the show. And as for school itself, well, the LA County Public Health Director, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, gave up the entire game about what they are doing in schools in this newly unearthed audio recording about when schools might see in person learning again. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. BARBARA FERRER, DIRECTOR, LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH: We don't realistically anticipate that we would be moving to either tier 2 or to reopening K-12 schools at least during - at least until after the election. It seems to us a more realistic approach to this would be to think that we are going to be where we are now until we get, after - until we are done with the elections. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Can you believe that? They are now admitting, she probably didn't know that was going to get broadcast. They are admitting this is all about politics until the election. I hope you in LA are happy with your leaders. While we believe, though, in the pursuit of happiness, they believe in the pursuit of guilt. Both sides believe in sin, I guess, but only one side believes in forgiveness. God may forgive you, but AOC never will. Remember this old '80s film classic? (BEGIN MOVIE CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If our lord wasn't testing us, how would you account for the proliferation this day of this obscene rock 'n' roll music, with its gospel of easy sexuality and relaxed morality? (END MOVIE CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, Hollywood was portraying a Middle American Christian town as anti-fun, anti-dancing. But now these liberal governors like Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, and of course a big Biden ally, who are against dancing, no large gatherings, keep your distance, kids, 6 feet, 8 feet, 10 feet. In fact pretty much everything in a less ideal world comes with a lecture these days. Hey, kids, let's watch the local sports team. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GREGG POPOVICH, HEAD COACH, SAN ANTONIO SPURS: I think I'm just embarrassed, as a white person. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So on behalf of the National Football League. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is what we, the players. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would like to hear you state. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We, the National Football League. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Condemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's hard to understand, because I'm white, I have white privilege. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Let's go see a show, or maybe a movie. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LEGEND, AMERICAN SINGER: His instinct is always to stoke the fires of racism and bigotry and xenophobia. SPIKE LEE, AMERICAN FILMMAKER: I don't expect this guy in the White House to say anything to heal the nation. He's incapable of doing this. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Let's read Harry Potter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Radcliffe went on to encourage fans of \"Harry Potter\" not to let Rowling's comments ruin the series for them. He wrote, \"To all the people who now feel that their experience of the books has been tarnished or diminished, I'm deeply sorry for the pain these comments have caused you.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: They are even going after J.K. Rowling. Who are these people to lecture us on anything? They've lost most moral authority on most issues, and they've done so, for instance, when they sell out to the Chinese Communist Party, or they became fanatics for abortion and gender morphing. Joe Biden has tethered himself to the new church of radicalism, which seeks to enforce its dogma on America by any means necessary. Imagine being audited by Biden's bureau of cancellation and condemnation. Oh, it's coming. We can't give them that power, it would be absurd. Right now, you can escape New York and California and move to free states, where you can retain your freedom to find your own happiness. Under President Biden, though, there will be no escape. Only fun-free domination, and that is the 'Angle'. Well, as part of the Left's campaign to punish Americans, Senate Democrats today blocked another much-needed COVID relief bill. Democrats want you to feel the pain, choke you off from all relief all the way until the election. Here to respond as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressmen, the anti-fun party, I never thought I would say it, the Democrats always wanted to portray themselves as the anti-prudes. They are going to let you be free and determine your own destiny, but that is completely out the window in these blue states, including your own. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I see it every day. But you know what's interesting, they don't want anybody to have fun or nobody could do anything, but they don't want to live by those rules. You watch Nancy Pelosi, no one can get their hair done, but her. You watch Governor Pritzker of Illinois, no one can go anywhere, but his wife. Or in Michigan, the governor says you can't put the boats in, but her husband wants to. But you've hit it on the head tonight. If you believe in an optimist, or if you believe tomorrow is going to be better than today, they won't allow you in the Democratic party. They want to make sure everything is shut down until after the election. Somehow, science works after that time. But what the Senate did today, and the people have to understand, yes. INGRAHAM: Congressman, I just want to ask you then I want to get to your point, I'm sorry to interrupt you. I want first to get your comment on that just-unearthed audio from a friends over at KFI radio. Barbara Ferrer in LA County, I guess the health director there is saying that schools can't foreseeably or conceivably open until after the election. How do you tie COVID until the election, unless it is all political at this point? MCCARTHY: Yes, it's only - once the election passes, science will say COVID goes away inside her mind. I don't understand that. They don't believe in this, and if you watch, everything has to stay shut down until the election. But what's the sad part is, Joe Biden says he will continue to shut everything down. And if you watch what he is doing, look what the Democrats did today. The majority in the Senate actually voted to pass a COVID bill to help America, but the Democrats despise this president so much, they want to inflict pain. They would rather see America suffer than watch the president succeed at something. So they are going to bring more pain onto this country just because they despise him. And what's interesting, remember what they called us last time, deplorables, and now they believe we are the enemies of the state. And it is not just me, it's you, it's everyone who believes in the pursuit of happiness, who believes and you watch the contrast between the President's rally and four people sitting around Joe Biden, which America do you want to live in? INGRAHAM: No, Congressman, Trump tonight was in his element, right? He gets his energy off crowds. MCCARTHY: He was on fire. INGRAHAM: I'm telling you, this was the best rally. MCCARTHY: It does. INGRAHAM: I've seen in, I don't know how long, probably all year, for sure. But he was having fun, he was very substantive on China, on NAFTA, which Biden has lied about again today. And it was very substantive-- MCCARTHY: Yes. INGRAHAM: --yet very upbeat, and I think people want to see that joy again from their political leaders, the common sense on the virus and the economy and foreign policy. But joy, we are supposed to have freedom to pursue our own happiness. The Democrats want to shut that down. MCCARTHY: If you put that rally up with a roundtable with Joe Biden and you put no sound, people could pick easily where they want to be. But remember, Joe Biden has been in Washington more than 47 years. And this is a true fact, Joe Biden has been in Washington so long, when he first went to the Senate, he served with people who were born in the 1800s. And now he claims that President Bush tricked him in voting for NAFTA? Well, that was a lie, because it was under Bill Clinton, and he voted for it. Every time he says he's opposed fracking, and now he supports it. He doesn't know where he is at any given time. INGRAHAM: We thought John Kerry was a flip flopper in the 2004 election, right? This takes flip-flopping to a new level. We actually have the videotape. Congressman, Republicans are trying to get relief to the American people, Democrats don't want to give it to them. Thank you for explaining this for all of us tonight. Great to see you. And while Joe Biden's mental decline is painfully clear, is there a better way to campaign against the former VP? Well, my next guest says there is. It's a fact, for nearly 50 years, Biden has been playing working-class Americans for fools. So he will kind of happily slap people on the back than working men and women across the country, but when he is back in D.C., well, he snuggles up to the lobbyists and the political hacks that end up destroying the livelihoods of the middle class and shipping those jobs to China. Joining me now, Dinesh D'souza, conservative author and filmmaker and the producer of two films coming out in the coming weeks, Infidel, we are going to talk about that next week in Trump card. Dinesh, why focus on Biden's grift, why not, and just his frailty? There are two big issues here, his mental decline, but his actual record that is well-established. DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Although we tend to focus on his mental incompetence, which is very visible and obvious to see. Over most of his career, Biden has actually, in the area of corruption, demonstrated great competence. And this competence has been the way he has orchestrated the corruption, pretty much everywhere he went under the Obama years, he would take a family member with him. And this is a tale of three Bidens, his brother Frank Biden, his other brother James Biden, his son Hunter Biden. So he took James Biden with them to Iraq, and James Biden got a contract, a federal contract to build 100,000 homes in Iraq, contract worth $1.5 billion. Then, Biden was made point man by Obama for Costa Rica. He went to Costa Rica, his brother, Frank Biden was in tow. And then Frank Biden subsequently got green energy deal contracts, even though none of these guys have any experience in these areas. When Vice President Biden went to China, he took Hunter Biden, while Biden was having official meetings, Hunter Biden was making deals on the side with the Chinese government worth $2 billion through the Shanghai free-trade zone to get all kinds of investments in the Chinese economy, including buying American companies and moving American jobs from places like Michigan to China. So, this is the actual long track record of corruption that has created gargantuan wealth for the Bidens. INGRAHAM: Yes, here is what Trump said today, Dinesh, about Joe Biden's son, Hunter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: It was revealed that a fund, partly owned by Joe Biden's son, Hunter, facilitated the sale of a Michigan auto parts producer to a leading Chinese military defense contractor. Biden spent his entire career selling Michigan jobs to China. China's military got American manufacturing jobs and the Biden family got paid a lot of money. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Dinesh, isn't that the kind of story that needs to be told and retold? D'SOUZA: I think it is critically important, because see, Biden knows that he is under disclosure requirements. If he buys stock, if gets a foreign contract, he is going to have to disclose it, but there are no disclosure requirements for family members. The Chinese have a long-standing practice of extending deals to family members in exchange for favorable treatment from foreign leaders. Biden recognized this. He surreptitiously became a part of it. So yes, I think this is a powerful theme that the Trump campaign should look at in the days leading up to the election. INGRAHAM: And Dinesh, finally, on NAFTA, this was a very telling exchange between Jake Tapper and Joe Biden on his initial support of NAFTA. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: When you ran for president and when Barack Obama ran for president, you both said you would renegotiate NAFTA, you didn't, he did. Does he deserve credit for that? BIDEN: No. I think if you remember, he didn't - he was the one that pushed that particular one the past. The house amended the bill. TAPPER: He renegotiated NAFTA and you didn't, is the point. BIDEN: Because we had a Republican congress. TAPPER: That's better, the USMCA is better than NAFTA. BIDEN: It is better than NAFTA. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Dinesh, ten seconds. D'SOUZA: Here you have a guy, Joe Biden, who quite frankly doesn't even know where he is. He floats around, he goes with whatever position he opportunistically thinks he needs to say, but I think behind what he is saying, the brain is at this point, completely a fog. INGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh. Thanks so much. And coming up, I am going to expose the faces of real privileged, those who are destroying our cities. Plus, a new generation of radicals is taking over the congressional black caucus, Candace Owens tells us what it really means. Up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YAMICHE ALCINDOR, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: White Americans are waking up to the privilege that they've had and saying that this is not right. KARLA GONZALES GARCIA, POLICY DIRECTOR COLORADO ORGANIZATION: (inaudible) stop your privilege getting in the way for you to work with us for our liberation. CHELSEA CLINTON, FORMER FIRST DAUGHTER: I think it's particularly important if they understand that as white voting privilege, because I want them to erode that privilege throughout their lives. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I want you to meet one of the products of that kind of woke up bringing. Her name is Clara Kraebber, a white 20-year-old, whose parents, one of whom is a Columbia University professor, own a $1.8 million New York City home, and a second one in Connecticut. Now, Clara reportedly attends Rice University, where tuition, room and board is a whopping $65,000 a year, nearly 60 percent more than the average black family makes in a year. All of which, Clara apparently reviles, because she has decided to help Black Lives Matter Marxist trash New York City in the name of racial justice. So how does vandalizing businesses actually help black Americans? Well, I doubt even a committed anarchist like Clara would know the answer to that. All she seems to know is that she needs to atone for her privilege by destroying America, and she's not alone. The Left has a long, illustrious history of convincing rich, college-educated kids to go out and commit crimes. So what do today's revolutionaries look like? Well, NYPD released mug shots of Clara and six other of her comrades, who were arrested last weekend after allegedly going on a storefront window smashing spree in the Flatiron district. Five of Clara's partners in crime reportedly also have privileged backgrounds. First, there is Frank Fuhrmeister, a 30-year-old ad man who currently owns a stately home in the Beacon Hill neighborhood. He was charged with rioting and possession of a graffiti instrument. Then there is Adi Sragovich, a 20-year-old student at the $72,000 a year Sarah Lawrence College. After she lost her phone rioting, her mother quickly bought her a new one. Got to make sure she can Instagram all the storefronts she destroys and smashes, I guess. And then there is Claire Severine, is a fashion model, and her comrade at arms, Etkar Surette, used to summer in Europe. How lovely. And finally, there is Elliot Rucka, the son of famous comic book writers, both of whom have TV deals. So do these sound like revolutionaries to you, or just privileged, poorly educated kids hell-bent on punishing the rest of the country over this concept they learned of white guilt? They didn't get there this way on their own, of course, they are just products of bad parenting, bad schooling, and a poisonous ideology that has been propagated by the Left for decades. One that, for many years, has peddled the idea that America is just a vile, racist, and irredeemable country that needs to be torn down and remade. And now we are seeing the fruits of the Left's labor of hate. And speaking of radical extremists, there is a rising generation of far- left Democrats taking over the congressional black caucus, really? Well, one of them is congressional candidate Cori Bush. She defeated the son of the CBC's cofounder, Rep. Lacy Clay, in last month's primary. And after her win, she had this message for her future colleagues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CORI BUSH, MISSOURI CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Yes, we have to expand the squad. We are bringing a different flavor, we're bringing our progressive values, and we're standing on what we believe, and we're bringing our experiences. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Here to walk us through what all of that means in the upheaval that it will cause Candace Owens, founder of the Blexit Movement and author of Blackout. Candace, how far will this drag people the CBC to the Left? The squad is getting a lot of people wins in this primary contest across America. CANDACE OWENS, FOUNDER, BLEXIT MOVEMENT: Right. The civil war rages on and the far-leftists are winning. And look, it's a perfect bedtime story, a political bedtime story. First, they came from Donald Trump and the Republicans, and the Democrat Party leaders cheered. Then they came for our border patrol officers, ICE agents, and the Democratic Party leaders cheered, then they came for our Border Patrol, ICE agents, and the Democratic Party leaders cheered. Now they are turned around, the come for the police officers, Democrat Party leaders cheered. And now, what's happening now? They're going for the Democrat Party leaders themselves, and they don't know what to do. And this is because they are realizing this is not the party of equality. This is actually the party of entitlement. These are kids that have lived through absolutely nothing but want absolutely everything, and they are ready to take it by any means necessary -- rioting, looting, burning things down, acting like toddlers. This is what happens when you infantilize an entire generation of young voters. And so in my opinion, they're reaping what they sell. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Here's another future Congressional Black Caucus member, Congressional candidate Jamaal Bowman, laying out his agenda on MSNBC back in June. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMAAL BOWMAN, (D) NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: We need bold, urgent action, similar to the new deal that was implanted by FDR. We need a Green New Deal in this moment. Our democracy cannot be healthy and cannot thrive with this level of racism and economic inequality existing within all of America's institutions. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Candace, Bowman says that Joe Biden is aligned with these views. Is he? OWENS: Absolutely. Joe Biden is aligned with anything he has to say to get elected, even though if it's the exact opposite of what he said the day before. He'll align himself with these radicals in the same way that Nancy Pelosi falsely aligned herself with these radicals, like Chuck Schumer aligned himself with these radicals until they wake up one day and they realize these radicals don't want the moderates. We are watching a literal civil war happen amongst the Democrat Party, and they are not going to recognize this party by the end of this election. There are a bunch of refugees, political refugees that don't know what this party is and what it stands for. And let me tell you, I believe that in November, all of those people are going to be voting for Donald J. Trump. INGRAHAM: And the corporate money, Candace, that has been pouring into Black Lives Matter, that's helping fund all of this. OWENS: Where is the money going? Nobody can answer the question. When you donate to Black Lives Matter billions and billions of dollars, where does the money go? There is no campus, there is no school, there is no office, there's no corporate structure. How have they raised billions and not been forced to tell you where that money is going? It's remarkably suspicious. We have an idea of where it's going. We don't know why these people are able to protest from 9:00 to 5:00, seven days a week. Sounds like it's a full-time job to me, Laura. INGRAHAM: We got to cut off the money, find out who is funding it and ending up in all of this destruction of the country. Candace, it is so great to see you tonight. Come back soon. OWENS: Thanks, Laura. INGRAHAM: And still ahead, why isn't the media telling the truth about what is going on with COVID in Europe? We're going to tell you. And high school players and parents, I talked about this a little earlier tonight, are up in arms over blue states shutting down football. One of those players and his dad are here with me next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you be prepared to shut this country down again? JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, if the scientists say shut it down? BIDEN: I would shut it down. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: The idea that more lockdowns are the answer to COVID is a discredited fever dream. Case in point, the little reported news that the European Union has once again become the world's COVID hotspot. Yesterday, the E.U., plus the U.K., Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, reported 27,233 new cases, compared to just 26,015 in the U.S. And as you can see in the charts here, Europe's caseload is clearly climbing while ours is in decline. Joining me now is Phil Kerpen, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Phil, there is a couple of issues here, but the left held up Europe and its 90 lockdown as this paradigm of how it should be done. And then Biden went on to basically echo what Europe and promised lockdowns in the future. What would that do at this point to get control of COVID? PHIL KERPEN, COMMITTEE TO UNLEASH PROSPERITY: It would have zero benefit in terms of controlling the spread of the disease, and it would be economically devastating yet again. And that should clearly be the lesson from Europe because everyone was saying a few weeks ago, look at how wonderful their hard lockdowns were. It was all worth it, even though they had mass devastation. And then you look and you say, well, no, the cases went right back up, anyway. It accomplished nothing for all that it cost. INGRAHAM: But when you look at the Worldometer website, which is my go-to, the deaths in Europe, just like the debts in places like Arizona and Texas where they seem to have come close to herd immunity, if not already at herd immunity, they are very, very low compared to the peak. Every death is tragic, we mourn every loss of life. But that death and hospitalization rate, that's still the key metric, is it not? KERPEN: It is, and that's really the good news about this second wave in Europe right now is it has much lower morbidity and mortality than we saw with the really bad wave in March and April. And that's certainly a huge, huge positive. And I think that is related to the fact that they are not in lockdown, that they're not in panic, that they don't have mass anxiety and disarray and people overflowing into hospitals with fear and anxiety, and maybe being put on ventilators when they shouldn't be or other mistakes being made. I think the president when he said you want to stay calm in a crisis and not panic, and it seems to me that we had the worst possibly response in both Europe and the U.S. when we were locking down and in disarray. And we're handling things much, much better now without that. INGRAHAM: Barbara Ferrer, who is the L.A. County health director, was caught on tape at a conference call with nurses from various schools and other officials, when she was pressed about when schools could reopen, she says, oh, it is not conceivable until after the election. How is that a metric for determining when schools should open? What does that show us about all of this, Phil? KERPEN: Laura, that is the most honest health official in America, because all of them are using this for politics. The school closures are -- they are extremely damaging to children. We are punishing and harming the people least at risk, at essentially, statistically zero risk from this disease there, at no greater risk in school than they would be at home, and they're at more risk from flu and more risk from car accidents. And yet we're punishing them. Why, other than to paralyze society and try to score political points. And the only difference between that health official and all of the other ones doing the same thing is she didn't know you are not supposed to say it. INGRAHAM: Yes, Virginia, D.C., all these places, all these schools should be open five days a week. I think it's child abuse. I'm going to say it -- it's child abuse. Phil, thank you so much, I really appreciate it. And as I mentioned in my \"Angle,\" the left just doesn't want you to have any fun at all. The latest example, the decision by the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference to cancel high school football this year despite a huge decline in new cases since May. In fact, only 89 new infections were reported in the entire state of Connecticut yesterday, and zero deaths. Now, given these numbers, it's not surprising what happened next. High school players, coaches, and parents stormed the state capital -- it's about time -- to demand a football season. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CROWD: Let us play! Let us play! Let us play! Let us play! Let us play! Let us play! (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now is one of the players who kickstarted this entire movement, Josh Martinotti, senior at Lewis Mills High School, and his father, Greg Martinotti. Josh, there are those who will say football isn't essential, if there is any risk of any spread, it's too much risk, and you shouldn't go back on the field. What do you say to them? JOSH MARTINOTTI, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FOOTBALL PLAYER: Football is definitely essential to many players and all around the country. Football, it's bigger than a game. It helps you with your mental health. It's a good stress relief. It just means a lot more than just playing the game. It's really a brotherhood. And I just think you can't really take away something like that from a kid. INGRAHAM: And Greg, we have breaking news tonight that the governor, perhaps, heard you all, and he's scheduling a meeting tomorrow with officials to reexamine when sports can open in the state. We hope that decision is in your favor. I used to play field hockey and softball and basketball in high school in Glastonbury, so I know how important sports are to young people. But what do you say to parents across the country who have been silent in the face of this lockdown of sports? GREG MARTINOTTI, FATHER OF HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYER: Just like anything else in today's world, you can't be silent. You've got to voice your opinion. Everyone has comments, concerns. Address it. Michigan addressed this about a month ago and they were able to get their state overturned and reinstate the game of football. INGRAHAM: And josh, you're a senior. And I assume you want to go on to college, and how does this affect your and other players ability to perhaps play at the collegiate level, if you can't play football this fall? J. MARTINOTTI: Well, my senior year would be a great year to get some added film to send out to colleges and help, hopefully. Obviously, our junior year is definitely the most important year in terms of that, and I already handled all my business in terms of that, but I was definitely looking to get some added film and help my chances playing college. And for all of the juniors at my school and all around the state, it's really tough for them, and they were looking to get their recruiting process started. INGRAHAM: And everyone across the country -- I know, Greg, you know this, if you're the parent of a student athlete, that just requires so much dedication and resolve, and we should be encouraging more of that, not less of it. Greg, final thought? G. MARTINOTTI: Absolutely. There's ways to mitigate it. Dr. Fauci even reported today, if there's case rates in green zones below less than five percent, kids should be back in school 100 percent, they should be back playing sports. Connecticut right now is less than one percent. All the students, all the athletes, they're masking up, they're practicing their social distancing. Football wears the most gear of all of the contact sports. Soccer, field hockey -- INGRAHAM: Well, gentlemen, there is a risk in football. There is a risk in any sports. There is risk in life. And I couldn't be more proud of you, Josh, for helping spearhead this effort in my old home state. And I hope everybody across the country is buoyed by what you did, and I hope for a good result from you. Go Lewis Mills, you guys take care. G. MARTINOTTI: Thank you, Laura. J. MARTINOTTI: Thank you. INGRAHAM: And still ahead, a wounded army vet is demanding Democrats stop using his image to prop up their anti-Trump ads. He joins me in moments for an \"Ingraham Angle\" exclusive. You don't want to miss this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOBBY HENLINE, U.S. ARMY VETERAN: Stop using me for your propaganda, for your agenda. I don't know what Trump said, but I'm sure he didn't call me a loser. I didn't hear him call me a loser. Stop using my image. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: The man you just saw it Bobby Henline, an Iraq war vet, who did four tours of duty and is the lone survivor of an IED blast in 2007. You would think his admirable, his heroic service would earn him some respect from the left. But instead, they are using him as a pawn to try to hurt the president by pushing now a widely disputed and anonymously sourced story from \"The Atlantic\" that alleges the President Trump made disparaging marks about our fallen heroes. Wounded war vet Bobby Henline joins me now exclusively. Bobby, what bothers you the most about all of this -- the Democrats using your image without your consent, or the fact they attacked the president with it? BOBBY HENLINE, U.S. ARMY VETERAN: There is so much to this, without the consent, attacking the president with lies. It is just unnecessary. It's wrong in so many different ways. This is Mental Health Awareness month in September, and we talk about 22 veterans a day killing themselves. They did not know who that person was they used in that image. I saw their things, their comments. They didn't know who I was. What if I was out having a depressed month, isolated because of COVID, my PTSD is kicking in, I'm drinking. I'm depressed about life. I'm looking on social media, and I see that the president called me a loser? How am I going to take that? I'm already in a depressed mood. They don't know what situation that veteran is in, and they just throw the picture out there like that, and they don't know how it's going to affect them. That could have been a veteran who just killed themselves last week. And here you just reminded the family about it, and you throw it out there, using it as a prop. There are so many things that could have gone wrong with this. So, I'm glad they got my face out there. It's not something I wanted to do. I'm not a political person. I'm not a man of fancy words or anything. But it's wrong to do that type of thing, and we've got to get this stopped. And that is my main purpose, is you've got to look on there. People, if you see a post like that, and that person's name is not in the caption and they are not tagged on there, most likely they don't know about it. So please report it. Don't share that stuff. INGRAHAM: And we are going to keep this -- I want people to continue to see you and the images of your tours and your heroism. But I have got to ask you, Tammy Duckworth, herself a wounded vet, a hero in her own right, responded to the bogus allegations against Trump. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Apparently, I too am a loser and a sucker in Trump's book. But let me tell you, that's good company for me to be in, with men and women who laid down their lives to defend this great nation. He doesn't understand honor and duty and loyalty because he himself has never displayed those types of actions himself in his own personal conduct. It is shameful that he is the commander in chief of this military. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Bobby, a lot of folks out there taking Tammy Duckworth's words as gospel. HENLINE: No, don't. The sources are anonymous. Stop right there. Don't spread the lies anymore. If they were true, they would say, this is my face, this is me, this is what I heard him say. No one is coming out and saying that, even though General Kelly's assistant said it wasn't -- they were there. They said these words weren't said. INGRAHAM: Bobby, Bobby, we are going to continue with you next week on the mental health awareness issue. Thank you so much for joining us tonight and thank you for your service. HENLINE: Appreciate it, thank you. Thank you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Donald Trump gave supporters in Michigan tonight a rare glimpse of his soft side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CROWD: We love you! We love you! We love you! DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Don't say that, I'll start to cry, and that won't be good for my image. We don't want -- you don't want to see me cry.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump Jr., EVP of the Trump Organization and son of the president, joins 'Sunday Morning Futures.' President Trump\u2019s oldest son defended on Sunday his father\u2019s reelection chances amid flagging poll numbers and criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s economic plan as \u201casinine.\u201d Speaking on \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. blamed the president\u2019s drop in the polls on the media coverage Trump has received recently \u2013 saying news outlets have been critical of the president while ignoring going after Biden. \u201cI think when you have the media onslaught where media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides,\u201d Trump Jr. said. \u201cThey're not looking into any of Biden's past. They're not looking into any of his history.\u201d He added: \u201cThey want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden. He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because once he is, you'll see how terrible this notion could be for America.\u201d PROFESSOR DOUBLES DOWN ON PREDICTION MODEL OF\u00a0TRUMP'S CHANCES IN 2020 While the polling gap between Trump and Biden has narrowed a bit since the former vice president held a double-digit led over the current White House occupant late last month, a RealClearPolitics average of polls still has Biden up nine points on the president with less than five months to go before November\u2019s general election. Trump Jr. also hit Biden on the Democratic candidate\u2019s recently released \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan, which proposes spending $700 billion on American products and research -- in the hopes of bringing back millions of jobs lost by an economy flattened by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cYou know that Joe Biden can sell this notion of \u2018now we're going to be buy American after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American Dream to China,\u2019\u201d Trump Jr. said. \u201cIt's asinine.\u201d Trump Jr. also accused Biden of using his time in public office to enrich his own family and once again questioned why the media isn\u2019t looking into the matter. \u201cI called it liberal privilege because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate because they can say one thing, do the other and never get called on it,\u201d he said. In an interview earlier this year, Trump Jr. called out Hunter Biden's business deals in Ukraine while his father was vice president.\n\u201cI was an international business person before my father got into politics. That\u2019s what we did. I\u2019m not going to say I haven\u2019t benefited from my father\u2019s last name, just like Hunter Biden did. That\u2019d be foolish to say,\u201d Trump Jr. said during an interview with Axios in March. \u201cBut, I haven\u2019t benefited from my father\u2019s taxpayer-funded office.\u201d \u201cAll of the sudden, he [Hunter Biden] goes over to the Ukraine and he\u2019s making 83K a month, so the media likes to do this, sort of false equivalence. \u2018You\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re doing that,\u201d Trump Jr. said at the time. \u201cWe stopped doing any new international business deals when my father won the presidency.\u201d Joe Biden on Thursday introduced his plan that also seeks to create 5 million new jobs and is the first of four\u00a0economic proposals Biden is\u00a0expected to roll out over the coming weeks. The American-centric proposals spotlighted by Biden will compete in this year\u2019s White House race with the \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda long pushed by Trump, who has emphasized protecting American workers and reenergizing domestic industries in decline while moving away from free trade and a global economy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The first part of the former vice president's proposal is a $400 billion investment by the federal government to purchase\u00a0American products such as cement, concrete, steel, and other materials to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. The second part is a $300 billion investment in research for new technologies, such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and 5G. Biden\u2019s plan also calls for new tax breaks and credits for small manufacturers \u2013 including those run by minorities and women \u2013\u00a0and would levy\u00a0penalties on\u00a0companies who take\u00a0federal money and then\u00a0move their investments overseas. The campaign says that Biden will also push federal investments toward\u00a0overlooked parts of the country that have not\u00a0received government help. Biden\u2019s proposals appear to be an acknowledgment of the political success the president has enjoyed pushing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election was in part due to his promises of bringing back American jobs and re-inflating flagging industries. And as president, he's waged an aggressive trade war with China and slapped tariffs on other nations, including longtime allies. Fox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

This is a rush transcript from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\" September 17, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER\u00a0CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to\u00a0TUCKER\u00a0CARLSON\u00a0TONIGHT. It is hard to believe that the current virus has been in this country for about nine months now since January.\u00a0And since the day that doctors discovered the first case within our borders, our leaders have assured us that they only care about our safety.\u00a0That's what this is about -- our safety.\u00a0They've told us that every decision they make as they fight this pandemic, they make in our interest. Every restriction they impose they tell us. They base on science alone.\u00a0Most Americans want to believe that because most Americans want to trust their government, but few still do. There's too much evidence that the COVID regime is political and our leaders are lying about it.\u00a0Tonight, there is conclusive proof of that, a remarkable story. A reporter with the FOX 17 TV station in Nashville, a man called Dennis Ferrier caught that city's top officials hiding key health statistics, and for no justifiable reason.\u00a0Ferrier uncovered a series of e-mails between the Mayor's Office that would be Nashville Mayor John Cooper who is a Democrat and the city's Health Department. In those e-mails, city officials discussed the fact that only a very low number of coronavirus cases have been traced to bars and restaurants in the city.\u00a0As of June 30th, of this year, for example, nursing homes and construction sites in Nashville each produced more than a thousand cases of the coronavirus. Bars and restaurants just 22 cases total.\u00a0Numbers like this could be great news for the City of Nashville. Bars and restaurants have been suffering there for months under crushing COVID restrictions. Thousands of workers have been laid off and many businesses have gone under and many more are on the brink.\u00a0Over the summer, the mayor, Mayor Cooper used the economic damage from his shutdowns to justify a massive 34 percent property tax increase on residents of Nashville.\u00a0So quarantines have hurt that city quite a bit. Residents would have been thrilled to learn that bars and restaurants were safe once again. But the Mayor refused to tell them that. He hid that information.\u00a0After reviewing new health numbers from bars and restaurants, a woman from the health department called Leslie Waller e-mailed this to Mayor Cooper's office. Quote, \"This isn't going to be publicly released, right? Just info for the Mayor's Office.\" A senior adviser to Mayor Cooper, Benjamin Eagles responded this way, quote, \"Correct. Not for public consumption.\"\u00a0Not for public consumption? Why would that be? These aren't the nuclear codes. This isn't national security information, it is public health data, and it should be public.\u00a0A month later, a reporter in Nashville heard rumors that bars and restaurants there were safer than the city was admitting they were, so he e-mailed the health department to find out exactly what was going on. What are the numbers?\u00a0E-mails now show that behind the scenes, this simple request for transparency panicked city officials. They schemed among themselves to hide what they knew, quote, \"We have certainly refused to give counts per bar,\"\u00a0wrote one. Why is that? Why would they refuse to give those numbers? Here is the answer and this is a direct quote, \"Because those numbers are low per site.\"\u00a0Oh, the numbers are low, so we hide them. Hide all good news. That's the policy. Otherwise, the fear might subside and our power along with it.\u00a0Today, reporter Dennis Ferrier tried to get more information from the Mayor. Why did the Mayor's Office lie about health information that could have helped the people of Nashville? The Mayor wouldn't answer that question, of course, so instead, he sent his minion, a flack called Chris Song to scold Ferrier for daring to ask that question. Watch.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0DENNIS FERRIER, FOX 17 REPORTER: We did ask for context yesterday and we're told not just no comment, but FOIA us and that doesn't really feel like a we-are-all-in-this-together comment.\u00a0CHRIS SONG, PRESS SECRETARY, OFFICE OF THE MAYOR: What you should have done was to come back, tell me that you had validated those e-mails in whatever way that you did --\u00a0FERRIER: Because you wouldn't -- you told us to FOIA, sir. You gave us -- you said, go through legal to extract this information because you don't want to share it, sir. I will argue with you all day but you're not going to -- you're not going to talk to me like this and walk away, I'll talk back to you the same tone that this is -- you know, this is America and the people have a right to know the real COVID number.Don't shake your head.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Finally, a real reporter somewhere. What you should have done was go back and tell me you validated the e-mails, said the flack. Rather than respond to the substance of the story, much less apologize and beg forgiveness for lying, the mayor's minion delivers a fussy little lecture about the proper protocol required before the public can ask a question of the Mayor.\u00a0Don't question your overlords, prole, you will take the coronavirus data we give you.\u00a0So why are they so afraid to tell us the real numbers? You know the answer.\u00a0The more data you have about the virus, the more facts, the more science, the less frightened you may be.\u00a0And that's why they always emphasize how many people have died, almost 200,000. But almost never who died.\u00a0If you knew the details, you might realize that getting a drink at a bar in Nashville or for that matter, sending their children to school in person poses very little risk to anyone.\u00a0As of tonight, COVID-19 remains what it has always been, overwhelmingly a threat to the elderly and to people who are already sick.\u00a0The median age of coronavirus deaths in this country as of June 1st is 75 years old. Ninety percent of all deaths have occurred among people over 55.\u00a0Americans under the age of 44 account for just 2.7 percent of coronavirus deaths.\u00a0This does not mean that COVID-19 is not dangerous, of course it is. It is dangerous. It's just not dangerous to the overwhelming majority of people who are being destroyed by the COVID-19 restrictions and that is unforgivable. There is no justification for it. They don't even want to talk about it and so they don't.\u00a0As of tonight, the restrictions, terrible policy decisions made by stupid and dishonest politicians like Mayor John Cooper of Nashville and many more like him are causing far more harm to this country and this population than the virus itself has caused.\u00a0For example, this summer, deaths attributed to Alzheimer's and dementia have risen to more than 20 percent above what is normal. Experts say that's because stress and isolation are contributing to those figures. They are killing people.\u00a0Suicide and substance abuse meanwhile have increased dramatically. We know that 12 percent of coronavirus deaths for the ages one to 24 include, and we're quoting now from the C.D.C. \"intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events.\" Those are comorbidities in their deaths. That is the real story, in other words.\u00a0But many Americans, because of the information encouraged by the left, which is misinformation, it is propaganda, they have no idea that any of this is going on. They don't know what this pandemic actually looks like.\u00a0They are told lies and they believe them.\u00a0Study after study has shown that one reputable study found that Americans quote, \"overestimate the risk of death from COVID-19 for people aged 24 and younger by a factor of 50 and they think the risk for people age 65 and older is half of what it actually is.\" End quote.\u00a0In other words, this is a disease that overwhelmingly threatens the elderly, but most people don't know that. Why is that? Why don't they know nine months in? Well, it might have something to do with the barrage of dishonest propaganda from national media organizations.\u00a0Watch CNN's chief body building expert explain why you must stay inside indefinitely as he goes out to harass bicyclists in the Hamptons.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: All right, so while most Americans are staying inside or should be, right, if they are not out protesting like fools, they are not happy about being told to stay home.\u00a0Staying home saves lives.\u00a0And the rest of us should be staying at home for our mothers and the people that we love and to keep us farther apart will ultimately bring us closer together in this cause.\u00a0No matter where the virus goes, the way to stop it will always be the same, our collective conscientious actions. Staying home.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Staying farther apart will bring us closer together. But it hasn't brought us closer together. It has atomized us. It has kept us apart. It hasn't ripped apart our society in ways that will be very difficult to fix.\u00a0The media have abetted this. Multiply what you just saw by hundreds of broadcasts on all the major networks for months and you begin to understand why so few people know anything about the facts of coronavirus. They are ignorant. It's sad to say, but it's true and the survey show it.\u00a0Why? Because their ignorance serves the purpose of the politicians who spread it. Terrified populations are easier for them to control. If you are frightened to go out outside, by definition you are also distracted, so you are less likely to wonder for example why the Governor of New York killed all of these old people by forcing coronavirus patients into nursing homes?\u00a0Not thinking about that suits, the Governor of New York just fine. Watch him blame you for putting the elderly at risk.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): My mother is not expendable, and your mother is not expendable, and our brothers and sisters are not expendable and we are not going to accept the premise that human life is disposable.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Thank you, Father Cuomo.\u00a0Andrew Cuomo should have been impeached for what he did in the nursing homes in the State of New York, if not criminally charged for what he did, but he wasn't. He never will be. What's amazing is he is still lecturing you for your supposed shortcomings.\u00a0He is guilty as hell personally, but he is every bit as self-righteous and never under any circumstances is he ashamed. None of them are ashamed. Just last week, the LA County Public Health Director, Barbara Ferrer admitted out loud without a trace of embarrassment that her entire lockdown scheme is tied to the national political calendar.\u00a0Kids must suffer, she said until quote, \"after the election.\"\u00a0(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\u00a0DR. BARBARA FERRER, LA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR: We don't realistically anticipate that we would be moving to either tier two or to reopening K-12 schools at least through -- at least until after the election.\u00a0It seems to us a more realistic approach to this would be to think that we are going to be where we are now until we get, after -- until we are done with the elections.\u00a0(END AUDIO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Until we are done with the elections. So at least it is clear now, we are not pretending. Until you learn to vote the right way, America, your businesses will die, your children won't be educated, and your population will cower alone. So let that be a lesson to you and in the meantime, don't ask questions.\u00a0Steve Glover is a City Council member in the City of -- the great City of Nashville and we are happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Glover, thanks so much for coming on.\u00a0STEVE GLOVER, CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, NASHVILLE: Thank you, sir.\u00a0CARLSON: A very straightforward question. It is your city, you're an elected official within the city, why can't you and the population of Nashville get a straight answer about what the basic coronavirus data are from the Mayor?\u00a0GLOVER: So I will give you what I think is probably a simple answer. I believe that the Mayor happens to substitute his wisdom on a regular basis for those who are in the health department, along with the professionals that he has around him in his own office and he constantly inserts his own wisdom versus those of outside and there seems to be a heavy-handed approach to his management style.\u00a0CARLSON: Yes, this doesn't seem to be guided by science in the slightest.\u00a0If you had 22 cases in bars and restaurants, then that suggests that maybe they shouldn't be locked down. Why would he hide that information? What's in it for him when the population of Nashville suffers?\u00a0GLOVER: Well, I mean, the problem is, all you're got to do is speculate on this. You know -- and you said, Nashville, a great city.\u00a0CARLSON: Yes, it is.\u00a0GLOVER: Nashville is absolutely a great city. We've got great people who live here.\u00a0We have people who embrace one another and who love one another. And we are also so very fortunate and blessed that we have great tourists that come and visit us and by the way, spend a lot of money in Nashville.\u00a0CARLSON: I know.\u00a0GLOVER: The major problem is, we don't have a city problem here in Nashville, we have a lack of leadership problem in Nashville and I don't -- I mean, I think you're asking the right question, forgive me for not being able to give you the answer in a definite manner.\u00a0I don't understand why we are doing this. We are destroying the downtown area literally, not only the economic engine for Nashville, but also an economic engine for the State of Tennessee.\u00a0You know, Governor Lee is opening the state back up. It's time that we do the same thing for Nashville.CARLSON: So you just had a reporter catch the Mayor of your city, one of the fastest growing cities in the country, hiding critical health data for political reasons. Why not impeach him? Why should he still be your Mayor for a single more day? That seems unforgivable to me.\u00a0GLOVER: Well, so I don't know the exact legal answer to that, I will tell you,\u00a0Tucker, over the last 24 hours, life has been a little hectic here because of this.\u00a0I've started working with the group,\u00a0https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__smarternashville.org&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=sQ6pYl1px_eT1cXrVuKXpj_rbTvcTZUCEj1IBgBNnXw&s=UTW4cK8DREPhBcBHjWeVLkfN5cQRfBJIml9_ekL-WzY&e=\u00a0 about a month ago, and we started looking at this data and as they brought it, because they are a lot smarter than I am -- as they brought this data to me, I looked at it because nothing ever added up.\u00a0But it's the same in any one of those cities that are run by the far-left liberal group. And so the problem was, none of the data made sense. Well, there are some wonderful people here that live in Nashville, very, very smart people. I mean, gosh, you want to talk about hospital area.\u00a0You know, Nashville is blessed to have wonderful hospitals, but they couldn't get the right hospital data. They could get the number of beds.\u00a0You know, they report ICU. They report all of these other things and you are going, OK, based on what? It never was factual or actual as far as what the real numbers were.\u00a0CARLSON: I hope you can find a way to get rid of that Mayor. There's no reason a city like Nashville should be held hostage by a liar like Mayor Cooper in my opinion.\u00a0GLOVER: We are working on it.\u00a0CARLSON: Mr. Glover, thank you.\u00a0GLOVER: Thank you, sir.\u00a0CARLSON: Godspeed on that. Thanks for coming on.\u00a0GLOVER: You, too, sir. Thank you.\u00a0CARLSON: As we just told you, the elderly has suffered more than any other group by far, it is not even close. And many are suffering extreme stress during these lockdowns. They are trapped alone, and many have died alone.\u00a0Why is no one talking about this? Why does no one seem to care?\u00a0Charles Camosy cares. We've talked to him a couple of times about this before. He is the author of the book, \"Resisting Throwaway Culture: How a Consistent Life Ethic Can Unite a Fractured People.\" What a great title.\u00a0Mr. Camosy, thanks so much for coming on.\u00a0So, we have talked before and I don't think we can talk enough about the effect of older people -- on older people of these lockdowns. What do you think it has been so far?\u00a0CHARLES CAMOSY, AUTHOR: What I think we have done is we have become utilitarian during the pandemic,\u00a0Tucker. In my classes, we talk about how utilitarianism puts a number of values and pushes it down to one value, say pleasure or pain or something like that.\u00a0We have decided that lowering the chance of increased infection rates is the only value we care about and when we do that, we end up with 11,000 more dead people with dementia in nursing homes. That was a big story in POLITICO and \"The Washington Post\" over the last 24 hours and no one seems to care, except those who are we wanting to resist this utilitarian way of thinking.\u00a0CARLSON: How exactly has this worked? So, if the isolation has contributed to the progression of dementia and Alzheimer's?\u00a0CAMOSY: That's right, so, it's not difficult to do the math. People who are already in this vulnerable situation become even more vulnerable if we say, hey, you're going to be by yourself for six months. Your family isn't going to be able to visit you, an overstressed working staff won't be able to help you out. Just chill for six months.\u00a0Well, we've seen the results -- decay and mortal, mortal loneliness.\u00a0CARLSON: This is what we do to violent prisoners. Why would we ever do this? I just wonder why there hasn't been some national effort to think through how you can help older people trapped alone in complete isolation in a holding tank, basically, which is what these places are. Why has nobody made an effort to do that, I wonder?\u00a0CAMOSY:\u00a0Tucker, the new -- and we've talked about this before. The new news is what we are doing in particular to those with dementia, and here is an important point I think that needs to be made.\u00a0We have decided -- 40 years ago, we decided that not every human being matters the same. You have to have certain traits. Rationality, self- awareness, memory, language.\u00a0Prenatal children abortion, don't count. Massive brain injury, don't count.\u00a0I'm starting a new book that is going to argue the next shoe to drop is people with dementia and we have to be ready for it.\u00a0I thought it would be a predictive book, it's turning out to be descriptive book based on these numbers.CARLSON: You're one of the few people talking about this and we appreciate it. Charles Camosy, thanks so much. Good to see you.\u00a0CAMOSY: Thank you.\u00a0CARLSON: So last month, former Trump adviser, Steve Bannon who ran the 2016 campaign was indicted and charged with fraud. Tonight, he joins us for his first interview since that happened. We will be right back.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0CARLSON: So for about a year, we've been talking about the presidential election out there somewhere on the horizon. You wake up this morning and you realize, it's 47 days away. Less than a month from right now, it will be the first Tuesday in November and we are going to vote for a new President.\u00a0This has been by far the most intense presidential election season in the lifetime of anyone watching it, but it feels like we are moving towards something even more intense. What's going to happen on Election Day and in the days following?\u00a0The people who have been thinking most clearly about this on both sides are the people who have done it before, who have been involved at a high level on the presidential campaign.\u00a0Steve Bannon has done that. He is one of the people who ran Donald Trump's2016 effort. He was recently back in the news last month. He was indicted on fraud charges related to a nonprofit, a Build the Wall nonprofit he was running.\u00a0He hasn't been on television since then. He hasn't given any interviews on advice of counsel. But we wanted to hear what he thinks is going to happen as we have toward November. We also wanted to ask him about the charges against him and he agreed to come on tonight and we are happy to have him.\u00a0Steve Bannon, thanks a lot for coming.\u00a0STEVE BANNON, FORMER CAMPAIGN ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP: Hey, thanks,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0Thanks for having me.\u00a0CARLSON: So I want to ask you first, you reemerged in the national consciousness in a fairly big way in August when you were arrested on fraud charges. You haven't responded publicly that I'm aware of to those charges.\u00a0So I want to give you a chance to sum up your views on it.\u00a0BANNON: Well, you know, Bill Burck is my attorney. You know him, I think he is the best attorney in D.C. so he says, hey, you should lay off this. But look, I have got to come forward.\u00a0Attorney General Barr said I think at Hillsdale the other night. This is head hunting of high-profile political targets that are associated with President Trump. It's not random that it was four years almost to the day that I took over the campaign that this indictment came out, right?\u00a0What these guys want to do is criminalize political speech, make sure I didn't go back to the campaign. Well, I was never going back to the campaign. The campaign is in great shape. You've got Bill Stepien, Jason Miller, Steve Cortez, and others. They are doing a great job of delivering a victory on November 3rd for President Trump.\u00a0So, I have been -- because of my work in War on Pandemic, we were the first guys to be on the pandemic in January, we understood what your opening segment was about,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0The Democratic Party has traumatized their base. They are not going to come out to vote. And so somehow, they have to concoct some effort to steal this election because they are not going to get people to come out and vote on game day, the 3rd of November of this year and that's what I've been working on for the last couple of months.\u00a0I was never going back to the campaign and that's where these guys messed up. My platform is bigger now. My voice is bigger. I have got more resources and all we are focused on is to make sure that the progressive left and the corporatists, they cannot steal the election of Donald Trump.\u00a0CARLSON: I want to just drill down briefly because this is a complex topic and you're going to have an opportunity to respond in court. But the sort of macro charge is that you defrauded people who sent you money to build a wall. You said you wouldn't take any money, the charges claimed that you did. What is your response to that?\u00a0BANNON: My C4 had a one million -- if you read the indictment, I had a $1 contract to kind of be the D.C. office and oversee the wall construction and to do seminars and conferences.\u00a0If you want to see it, go to \"Vice News.\" Go to BBC. Go to the opening season of Showtime's \"The Circus,\" the opening episode in the 19th season.\u00a0They are traveling around the country following us on these Town Halls.\u00a0We have Town Halls and conferences. We built a wall -- two-thirds of a mile wall up a mountain in El Paso within a hundred days of starting. I was a contractor and ran an Advisory Board that brought together the best and brightest of all the wall people, so they are not going to criminalize, they are not going to shut me down by talking about the wall. They are not going to criminalize us talking about the wall.\u00a0CARLSON: OK.\u00a0BANNON: We've brought in Kobach and Sheriff Clark and all of these guys. So that is what the indictment failed to say, but look, all of that will come out in court over time.\u00a0The key thing is --\u00a0CARLSON: It will, it will and I don't --\u00a0BANNON: ... is that they are going to -- yes, the key thing is they are not going to shut me -- they want to criminalize political speech and they are not going to shut me down.\u00a0I'm more focused than ever. We are kicking off a national tour on Monday called the Plot to Steal 2020. They are not going to stop my voice in assisting President Trump in making sure that this election that he is going to win on the third is not stolen from him.\u00a0CARLSON: Big Tech is clearly taking a side in this election. They have unprecedented levels of power over what people know and, I'm wondering how you think they will use that power as they approach the election specifically.\u00a0BANNON: You saw the other night. You had Dr. Yan on from China who is a fact witness on those weapons labs over there and also wrote this amazing paper. What Twitter did is rip her Twitter account down right away. They took her off Facebook when they had to replay your show that was on fire throughout the world.\u00a0But they allowed the Chinese Communist Party to beat down on her every second with all of their running dogs.\u00a0That's what you are going to see. That's a preamble to what is going to happen on November 3rd. They are talking about it. They are already saying both Facebook and Twitter that they are not going to announce a winner.\u00a0Here is what is going to happen, Donald J. Trump is going to win the vote on the only day that matters. That's November 3rd. He is going to win the real election in the way we've done it with secret ballots with people going in to a booth and voting for the President of the United States, OK.\u00a0By that end evening, he will be the winner and what they are going to do is that between the Lawfare they've got with 800 attorneys under Eric Holder, the mob they've got with Antifa and the radical elements of Black Lives Matters, but most importantly, the digital muscle of Facebook and Twitter, they are going to sit there and they are going to not declare Trump the winner.\u00a0CARLSON: You were right there running the campaign four years ago today, looking at it the poll numbers now as objectively as you can, as compared to the numbers you were looking at four years ago today, how do you think the President's re-elect looks.\u00a0BANNON: I think the President -- I think the team has done a great job.\u00a0When I look at these numbers in the cross tabs, when I drill down on them, I think the President has not just a great shot, I think he will be the winner on November 3rd. I think the campaign is totally focused and I think Biden is a cypher. He can't draw a crowd.\u00a0So I think right now, I think the campaign is doing great. The President is doing great. I see a victory on November 3rd and I was the first guy to tell him he was going to win back in August 16.\u00a0CARLSON: And then maybe then the real contest begins. Steve Bannon, I am glad that you came on. Thank you very much.\u00a0BANNON: That's when the war starts.\u00a0CARLSON: I am beginning to think that's true. I appreciate it. Thank you.\u00a0BANNON: Thank you, sir.\u00a0CARLSON: So you may have the sense particularly if you've got kids in school that things are completely out of control in schools. They are teaching things that are flat out propaganda, BLM propaganda and it turns out, you are right.\u00a0We have lesson plans that will shock you, right after the break.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0CARLSON: The President today announced the creation of something called the Patriotic Education Commission. It will be designed to combat something called Critical Race Theory which is the lunatic lie that teaches our children some people are inherently worse than others. Some are morally tainted because of their skin color.\u00a0That is the definition of racist propaganda. It is hard to believe that exists in our country, but it's flourishing.\u00a0And the President said that explicitly. Watch.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Critical Race Theory, the1619 Project and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda.\u00a0Ideological poison that if not removed will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together. It will destroy our country, that is why I recently banned trainings in this prejudiced ideology from the Federal government and banned it in the strongest manner possible.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Well, the usual partisans were outraged by this, needless to say.\u00a0Dan Beyer, a car dealer who somehow became a member of Congress said it was fascism, but the geniuses were silent in June when the people behind \"The New York Times\" 1619 Project effectively the Bible of critical race theorists encouraged rioters to destroy private property in the name of racial justice.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0NIKOLE HANNAH JONES, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Violence is when an agent of the state kneels on man's neck until all of the life is leeched out of his body.\u00a0Destroying property which can be replaced is not violence and to put those things to use the exact same language to describe those two things, I think, really -- it's not moral.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: When did dumb violent people get so much power in this country? By the way, if that woman's private property was destroyed, I bet she would be saying something very different.\u00a0So the President's decision to ban Critical Race Theory indoctrinations at the Federal agencies earlier this month was an important step, but you'd be wrong if you thought this poison is confined only to the U.S. government.\u00a0Just about every single K-12 school in America has ramped up their propaganda efforts this year to teach children that this is a fundamentally bad country that some people are fundamentally flawed because of the way they look and that the whole American experiment is basically essentially racist and therefore, immoral.\u00a0Even though the 1619 Project contains fundamental and verifiable historical falsehoods, it is garbage, it is not real history, teachers in Chicago, New York and New Jersey and Washington are already using it in their classrooms. No one stopped them, so they are. We are going to look back on this in shame and horror.\u00a0Even schools that haven't specifically adopted the 1619 Project are taking a similar approach. Sometimes, they are even more radical. This show has obtained a lesson plan from the Buffalo Public School System. It goes far beyond teaching bad history and deliberately advances the agenda of Black Lives Matter, of a political organization.\u00a0For example, one lesson plan teaches fourth and fifth graders to question the importance of their parents, of their own mothers and fathers. The lesson plan instructs teachers to discuss various quote, \"guiding principles\" with students including so-called black villages that assist in the -- and we're quoting now -- \"disruption of Western nuclear family dynamics and return to the collective village that takes care of each other.\"\u00a0They are teaching this to your kids that your family should be destroyed.\u00a0Why are we allowing this? You know what this is, it is an all-out war on the most important thing we have, which is the American family. The one thing that can help bring back some of our corroding cities.\u00a0Nothing else has worked and we spent over a trillion dollars, it hasn't worked. That's demonstrable.Families do work and anyone who has emerged from a place like that, of any background or color can tell you, families are essential and yet, they are teaching children that families, their families are the problem.\u00a0Another lesson plan explains to second, third and fourth graders that quote, \"the need for the BLM Movement.\" Oh, OK. Now, you might think a Marxist organization that destroys private property and wants to replace parents is a bad thing. But that's not what your children are learning.\u00a0Other lesson plans actually teach students the specifics of the BLM platform, which rejects Western family structures. Another lesson plan for grades two through four explains why all lives matter is a problematic phrase, yes, all lives don't matter.\u00a0This is insane and it doesn't stop in elementary school. The goal is to redefine education at all levels and turn it into a shell for propaganda.\u00a0At the Thomas Jefferson School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, probably the best public school in the United States, officials are eliminating their merit based admission system. Why? In the name of diversity.\u00a0They have replaced a rigorous application process with a random lottery system. Will the school survive? No, of course not. It will not be the best school in the country. They just wrecked it.\u00a0In a few years, there might not be any top schools left in this country.\u00a0Critical Race Theory though will probably flourish and that's the whole point. Why are we letting this happen to our children?\u00a0Max Eden is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. He joins us tonight.\u00a0Max, thanks so much for coming on. How widespread is this poison and it is poison?\u00a0MAX EDEN, SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Yes, you know,\u00a0Tucker\u00a0it is hard to get a good grasp at exactly how widespread it is. You know, you see things on social media. You would like to think they are anecdotes.\u00a0When you see a school district like Buffalo just put that out there as though they are proud of it, it is cause for deep alarm. I mean, that came from the school district's Department of Culturally Responsive Education, right?\u00a0And New York State adopted statewide standards in culturally responsive education, the architect of which was an Education Professor who has literally said that it is white supremacism to expect black students to read and speak American Standard English.\u00a0Just the other week, another Superintendent in New York said that we shouldn't teach the success stories of black Americans because doing so somehow denies or undercuts their ideas of systemic racism.\u00a0I think we can expect this is a full-on states have committed to it, individual teachers who have a sense of social justice defined by Critical Race Theory are going to take it into their own hands even if it is not necessarily on the school district's website.\u00a0CARLSON: So let's get to the core idea that I think we should work to fight and that is the idea of blood guilt. In it, some people are born with guilt, some people are born inferior and some people are born superior.\u00a0We rejected that as a nation a long time ago. We have a monument on The Mall as a testament to fact we reject it. How common is that lie in our schools?\u00a0EDEN: Yes, well, I think this really ties into the 1619 Project, which you discussed the falsehoods of it, but I think the audience needs to realize this isn't just being adopted in major school districts. Teachers are taking it into their own hands and the true purpose of this according to Nikole Hannah-Jones is to advance reparations.\u00a0And she has said further than that, that's her goal because she decided that it was more realistic than and I quote, \"How can we stop white Americans from being white?\" Now, curriculum can't affect skin color. What this is about is what you're saying, it is about blood guilt.\u00a0It is about this critical ideology that takes things that you and I and most Americans think are virtues, things like the nuclear family, things like a sense of urgency, delayed gratification, it defines them as whiteness and tells your kids that it is your job to dismantle white supremacism.\u00a0CARLSON: They have no right to do this. They have no right to destroy our children. They have no right to destroy our schools and soon, we are going to put an e-mail address on our screen, starting tomorrow and going forward, for any parent who have seen examples of this. Please send them to us.\u00a0I agree with you, Max that this is likely ubiquitous and until we know its extent, we really can't fight against it which we should do.\u00a0Max Eden, I hope you'll come back. Thank you.\u00a0EDEN: Sure, I would love to. Thank you.\u00a0CARLSON: Well, just a few months ago, and you'll remember this story, the City Council of Minneapolis decided to defund the police. What could happen next?\u00a0Crime went up, it turned out in Minneapolis and guess who is upset about it? The people who defunded the police. And guess who they are blaming? The police.\u00a0One of the greatest stories ever. Stay tuned.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0CARLSON: June is a month redlines with possibilities. The flowers have opened, and the birds are singing, anything is possible. It was back in June that the Minneapolis City Council decided to defund the police.\u00a0They were pretty excited about it at the time. The City Council's President went on CNN and said anyone who disagreed with defunding the police -- and this seemed plausible in June -- is probably a racist.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Do you understand that the word dismantles or police free also make some people nervous? For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home was broken into, who do I call?\u00a0LISA BENDER, MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Yes, I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors and I know -- and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step out and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality where calling the police may mean more harm is done.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Yes, calling the police needs more harm done. Yes, that seemed possible in June. That same month, another City Council member from Minneapolis, a guy called Phillipe Cunningham lamented that money was flowing to the cops instead of say people with Sociology degrees or Masters in Post Modern Feminist Dance. Watch.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0PHILLIPE CUNNINGHAM, CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, MINNEAPOLIS: Al of that money that has been going into the Police Department and have we gotten in return? Pain, trauma and hurt. It is time for us to get behind community and get behind the strategies that we know work.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Yes, it's time to get behind the community. And so with that in mind, the City Council of the City of Minneapolis voted to defund the police. Then something happened that nobody could have expected.\u00a0All the cameras, all the CNN crews, all the activists, they all went home.\u00a0But for those who were stuck in Minneapolis, they noticed it was getting dangerous, really dangerous.\u00a0So you know what happened? You can guess. At a meeting this week, the same City Council who had voted to defund the police demanded answers from the Police Chief, why weren't the police doing more to stop criminals? Watch.\u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would appreciate some more information on how addressing the carjacking -- I know that there has been a number of them in the community and it really terrorized residents.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Gun violence, drug dealing, intimidation, extortion.\u00a0People are having to pay to get out of their alleys.\u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Last night, I had yet another 17-year-old murdered in my ward. I would say that I don't have an exact number, but it has been at least five 17-year-olds who have been murdered in my ward.\u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0CARLSON: Well, the City Council President, Lisa Bender was at the meeting.\u00a0In June, she admitted she had privilege. Does she still have that privilege? She didn't address that this week.\u00a0But she didn't seem to think that calling the cops was quite as racist as she used to think it was. In fact, this week, she asked the police, how do we get this under control?\u00a0It's too good.\u00a0Ryan Cleckner is a former Army Ranger sniper. He has some ideas for how we might get this under control in Minneapolis. Ryan, great to see you. Now, I should stipulate that most of these City Council members have been immune from the effect of their own policies, of course, because they have taxpayers who they bill for private security.\u00a0But for everyone else in Minneapolis wondering why did the city go to hell, what do you think happened in Minneapolis? Any ideas?\u00a0RYAN CLECKNER, FORMER ARMY RANGER SNIPER: Shocking,\u00a0Tucker\u00a0that this could happen. I mean, defunding the police empowers criminals. I honestly don't know what is worse that they thought of the idea to defund the police or that they are surprised by the results.\u00a0I can't keep up. I mean, this happening in blue states with blue governors and blue cities with blue mayors with blue DAs, many of whom by the way have had their campaigns funded by George Soros and other left-wing activists that just want to watch America burn. They are getting what they paid for.\u00a0It is so laughable, but they are shocked at this result and it is so sad that these are real people being affected by this.\u00a0CARLSON: Yes, you're absolutely right. Soros did pay for a lot of this and he is definitely getting a return for his money. He usually does.\u00a0But I wonder all of the kind of normal sweet people in Minneapolis, a lot of whom are liberal, they didn't notice until Memorial Day weekend that their police department was systemically racist and that they possessed privilege. I mean, this all seems to kind of come out of nowhere. How did that happen exactly? And is it gone yet? Have they been awakened to reality yet do you think?\u00a0CLECKNER: I think we have good signs that people are being awakened to reality. I really do. The fact that they are calling out here and trying to figure out what's wrong, a little too late, but at least maybe they are getting the signal now.\u00a0I mean, I am in the firearms industry. When I look at our gun sales, we have had record gun sales more than any other months we have ever had in recorded history and that's not because of gun owners like me. That's because of some of these liberals that maybe weren't gun owners before that are realizing their safety is their responsibility.\u00a0I mean, I have been told by anti-gunners all the time, I don't need a gun because we have the police. Well, I think that's absurd on its face. I mean, I still have a fire extinguisher even though I have a fire department, but I think police are majority heroes, great people, but you're stuck facing the problem before the police even get called and having a firearm, people are realizing that not only can they not rely on the police to stop some of these attacks, but when you defund the police, they are not there anymore, you're responsible for your own safety.\u00a0CARLSON: I think that is exactly right. It is all very obvious now. Biden has pledged to take your guns. They are going to go after the ammo. You watch and we're going to do a segment on that just as soon as we can find a guest to explain it.\u00a0I hope you'll come back, Ryan. Great to see you.\u00a0CLECKNER: Sure. Thanks,\u00a0Tucker.\u00a0CARLSON: The show is not over yet. Donald Trump about to take the stage at a rally in the State of Wisconsin. Stay with FOX News for more reality. We will be right back.\u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0CARLSON: Welcome back. The President is in Wisconsin tonight for a rally.\u00a0As news breaks, FOX News will cover it.\u00a0We will be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m., every night at that time, the show that it is your sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. There is Air Force One on the screen.\u00a0I hope you have the best night with the ones you love. We are going to hand it off to the Great Sean Hannity about 11 seconds early, but generosity kind of runs rampant.\u00a0SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: You can either fill the time or just throw it to Hannity. No big deal. What the hell.\u00a0CARLSON: You caught me.\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: That it has a busy one indeed. Thanks Bret good to see you tonight. And good evening to everybody I'm Martha MacCallum and this is THE STORY in America tonight, it's a complicated one. 55 days as we set ahead of this Presidential Election, the gloves are definitely off. Tonight, the president pushing back on a new book by Bob Woodward, and this time there is no debate over what were said, some of those the conversations were recorded and some of them were released today. The president's Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is here to respond to those in other stories tonight in just a moment. Also this evening we'll you talk to Deroy Murdock on Kamala Harris saying that she is \"Proud of Jacob Blake\" who, by the way, aside from the other story that you know about him, was accused of assault by his ex-girlfriend. Sarah Huckabee is also here tonight, we'll talk to her about the revelations coming straight from the mouth of Peter Strzok tonight. She is here as well. But first, to the Woodward story as promised, we want to remind everybody to take you back that point in time with the virus spread just before these audio recordings were made to kind of set the stage here. On January 20th, China did announce that the virus was indeed airborne. It was transmitting from human to human. They also confirmed that the virus was indeed deadly. And them here's what the president said on January 30th, several days later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We are working with China, just so you know, and other countries very closely so it doesn't get out of hand. And something we have to be very careful with. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Be very, very careful with it he says. The next day is January 31st, the president then shut down travel from China with some notable exceptions, then you've got this seven days later on from February 7th he says this on a phone call with Bob Woodward, listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: It's a very tricky situation. It goes through error Bob, that's always tougher than touch, you don't have to touch things, but the air, you just breathe the air and that is how it passed. So that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flues. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So here is what others were saying right around that same period, February 7th. Listen to these. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR: This is a serious global public health situation, but again the immediate risk to the American public is low. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We have taken a lot of time to put protocols in place and quarantine procedures. I understand the fear we've gone through this before, Zika of virus, Ebola et cetera, but looks at some connection to the reality of the situation. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): You should come to Chinatown. We think it's very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So let's bring in White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, good to have you with us tonight. Thank you for being here. MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Thank you. MACCALLUM: I want to play one of the other sound bites that have gotten a lot of attention and that helps people saying that the president was minimizing the risk here, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDOE CLIP) TRUMP: I wanted to always play it down, I still liked playing it down because I don't want to create a panic. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Is not problematic for the president Mark? MEADOWS: Well, I think any great leader, what they do is they take information that they have, they make sure that they vet it with in this case it was with their advisers both doctors and those within the White House to actually make sure that we make prudent decisions. But what you don't want to do is create panic. But at the same time, it was an all hands on deck. I can tell you not only did that happen in January and February but when I came on board in March, it was around-the-clock vigilant effort to make sure that this president did everything he could to address it. But I can also say that what we know now about the virus is very different than what we knew at that time, because a lot of the scientific advisors and doctors were saying listen, we can contain this, we can make sure that we keep it in Washington State and California and it's not going to be a big problem. And yet this president was consistent in saying that we needed to do everything we could. He shut down literally the economy on the advice of doctors to try to make sure that we mitigated the damage. MACCALLUM: Yes, that's true. MEADOWS: And yet, he's been one of the most transparent presidents as it came to dealing with this situation whether it's on a phone call with Woodward or with anybody else. MACCALLUM: By the way, what was your understanding of how much access Bob Woodward had to the president? You're the Chief of Staff, were you surprised to learn that he was on the phone with him for 18 hours often late at night making these recordings? MEADOWS: I'm not surprised that the president was on the phone with Bob Woodward. Honestly his access to the White House is probably something that I would not have recommended had I been in the Chief of Staff role early on but it's the typical thing that the president does. He believes that he has nothing to hide that that is the great thing about him. He is willing to talk to anybody about any subject no matter how difficult. He's probably given more interviews than any president in modern history and it's all about making sure that the American people stay informed. And whether you like it or not, he's willing to answer the difficult questions. MACCALLUM: So well, at this point whether he likes it or not this is going to be in the mix of 50 some days from the Presidential Election. The numbers are fairly consistent in these polls. This is a new Monmouth Poll, 37 percent say that he did a good job handling Coronavirus, 56 percent say that he did a bad job and here is how Joe Biden teed off of these reports on the Woodward book let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life and death betrayal of the American people experts say that if he would've acted just one week sooner, 36,000 people would have been saved. If he acted two weeks sooner back in March, 54,000 lives would've been spared in March and April alone. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: How do you think that message will sit with the American people Mark? MEADOWS: Well, it doesn't surprise me that Joe Biden will jump on this unprecedented pandemic and try to use it for political gain. We've seen it over and over again. So let me just frame it this way. If he had done what Joe Biden the candidate recommended, we wouldn't have shut down travel from China. We wouldn't have shut down travel from Europe. When Joe Biden was sitting there condemning the president because he was a candidate for the highest office in the land, this president was actually taking action. So this doesn't surprise me. Most people are going to see this as more Joe Biden complaining about what he didn't do and may be what he ought to focus on is what he didn't do over the last 47 years? MACCALLUM: Let's take a look at this quote for General Mattis; it's also been a difficult week for the president with regard to his relationship with some of the high ranking members of the military. And in this part of the book, General Mattis is quoted as saying to Dan Coats who was then the Director of National Intelligence with regard to issues that had to do with Russia and Putin and whether the president was hiding something or they had something on him Dan Coats suggests in the book. General Mattis says maybe at some point we are going to have to stand up and speak out. There may be a time when we have to take collective action. I wonder what goes through your mind when you look at that and I wonder whether you think that is what happened in this Atlantic story. Do you believe that General Mattis was one of the sources for that? MEADOWS: Well, I don't know who the source is but I can tell you that based on this first hand source and talking to the president on a regular basis and the seeing how he loves the veterans, the military men and women that served. And yes, even our generals and our flag officers currently have high regard and high respect for them - here's what you find. In Washington, D.C., there are a lot of agendas and most of those agendas are to someone's personal benefit, not to the American people's benefit. What I do know about this president, he's always talked about America first and putting the American people first, that is going to come at great odds with what happens here at Washington, D.C.? And so here is - I wish that Dan Coats and General Mattis had been as forthright and going after what we know happened which was spying on the Trump Campaign, perhaps we would be in a different spot right now. MACCALLUM: Before I let you go, the question of another stimulus package. I know there is expected to be a vote on Thursday but it doesn't look like there is much optimism that anything is going to get passed in Congress right now. And there's a new Harvard Poll that says that half of all households in major U.S. cities report having serious financial problems due to COVID-19 pandemic. Depleted savings, problems paying credit card bills, covering medical bills, black and Latino households in all four cities were particularly vulnerable here. So what do you say to them tonight about why there isn't any more aid forthcoming? MEADOWS: Well, here is what I would say as there is one person in Washington, D.C., that is acted on your behalf that is the President of the United States, there's still one person willing to act and go further and compromise and make sure we get help coming to you. If you're hurting from this whether it is unemployment or you have insecure job future, this president wants to help. Here is what we need to do. Let's go ahead and pass a bill that we've agreed upon, at least the concept of what we've done whether it's an enhanced unemployment, help the business, schools. We can agree on all that Nancy Pelosi come to the table, let's agree on that and then what we disagree on, let's continue to debate and have a fight on that. MACCALLUM: I just wonder if you - when we look at this employment picture that seems to be improving, do you think that it means that people are going back to work and does that make you more hesitant to add another enhancement package on unemployment? MEADOWS: Well, we do know that people are going back to work. Not only the numbers support that but the unemployment at 8.4 percent is actually better than what we thought Martha. But the other thing is, is not to ignore some of those that are still in harm's way. And so that's the president as recently as just a couple of hours ago was saying how can we work towards executive action to meet the needs since Congress obviously is not going to do that? We'll get there in the end I'm hopeful that Democrats and Republicans will come together. MACCALLUM: Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, good to see you sir. Thank you very much. MEADOWS: Good to see you thanks. MACCALLUM: Also here tonight, Alex Berenson, Former \"New York Times\" Reporter and Author of unreported truths about COVID-19 and lockdowns. And Chris Hahn, Former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and Syndicated Radio Host. Good to have both of you with us. Chris, let me start with you. CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Great to be here. MACCALLUM: Did we learn anything that people didn't already know about the president's take in handling COVID-19 in these revelations today? HAHN: Yes, I mean the president made it very clear to Bob Woodward that this is a deadly disease and it could be up to 5 percent people dead. And he still had rallies including his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which claimed at least one of his supporters that we know of, Herman Cain. And look there are still people around this country going to motorcycle rallies in Sturgis because the President of the United States failed to leave this country and tell them the truth about COVID-19. It's despicable and I know he's watching still, he should resign. Not four more years, we can't take four more days of this man, he's not taking this seriously and many people are dead because of it. MACCALLUM: So do you think that - do you agree with Joe Biden stepped back from this but he said there should be a mandatory mask rule across the country and then he said oh well, maybe there shouldn't be. HAHN: Joe Biden said that states should have mandatory mask rules. The federal government obviously-- MACCALLUM: --that's the way the federal system works. HAHN: But here's the thing Martha if the President of the United States would lead by example instead of calling a reporter out like he did just Monday who was wearing a mask, doing what he should be doing to protect his fellow people, including the president himself. The president is failing to lead and failing to set the example and his callousness shown in this book with his own words is not going to go over well with the American people. MACCALLUM: As I pointed out everybody knew that the disease was deadly and that it was transmitted human to human at this point. So there was nothing that was being hidden at that point, that was already known to the public. So the president wasn't saying anything that you didn't know or I didn't know at that point. Alex, what is your take on what we are hearing today about this book and what the president had to say given all the work that we've done on COVID? ALEX BERENSON, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER: Well, I don't particularly care about the politics here, obviously it is not good for the president - the thing that I actually care about that is going to be used in a very negative way in the next couple of months is lying about young people being at risk. The teachers unions probably popped champagne when they heard that. The fact is there were a few days in mid-March when people were saying that publicly basically every piece of evidence in the last six months suggested that children and young adults are at basically no risk of serious illness or death from this virus. Now that is not 100 percent true, you can never say anything categorically but one child out of every million American children has died from the Coronavirus that is far fewer than the flu, that's far fewer than many other causes. Children and young adults are not at high risk here and we have to open the schools. Unfortunately this is going to be used against that and that really upsets me. MACCALLUM: What do you say to that, Chris? HAHN: Well, I mean look, schools are opening in places where they can open like here in New York or where we have got it under control because we have a leader who set an example-- (CROSS TALK) HAHN: I'm sorry, I have a child in school in New York Alex, so let me talk, you can theorize all you want. But in New York State where we got it under control because we had leadership, we had a Governor who said wear a mask, social distance, follow the rules, let's open up slowly instead of a guy who's having rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and encouraging people to go to Sturgis and coming out to see him speak because his ego needs it. Look, we have it under control here in New York and if the rest of the country did what New York did when New York did it, this entire country would be back right now but president-- MACCALLUM: New York lost more people than any other state in the entire country and many of them were in nursing homes due to negligence from the Governor of New York State. BERENSON: That's right. Chris that's right, you got it first and that is the only reason that New York is where it is right now - all of the Europe- - HAHN: They took it serious. BERENSON: --task and their schools are reopening anyway, masks do very little or nothing, that's what the science says. HAHN: And Alex, the president didn't care about it because it was only in blue states now it is in red states --. MACCALLUM: Wait a minute Chris, you asked for the respect to speak when you wanted to so Alex go ahead and finish your thought. BERENSON: Sure. The fact is that masks do very, very little if anything. And all over Europe, they are reopening despite the fact that there are spikes in cases for the most part they are reopening without any outdoor mask mandates and in some cases no indoor mask mandates, there is just very, very little evidence that any of steps that any of these people want to take up to and including full lockdowns which may or may not have actually worsen the problems in New York and the Northeast. HAHN: I doubt it. MACCALLUM: I think all these; all over there is going to be a huge-- HAHN: No knowledge of anything, you're lying to the American people. BERENSON: We need to actually follow what the science says and not what we wish it would say. MACCALLUM: Yes. HAHN: Yes, I agree and we should. MACCALLUM: Chris, I got to go. But I do think that there is going to be a huge amount of retrospective on all of the issues that Alex brings up when all of the science is in on what works and what doesn't work and who can get it and who is susceptible to it and who is not? A lot we still don't know. Chris, thank you very much, Alex good to have you here tonight. BERENSON: Martha, thank you. HAHN: Thanks Martha. MACCALLUM: So Joe Biden pitching himself to the working-class voters in Michigan, we are going to show you what he had to say about made in America, now a familiar refrain on both sides of the election. And a new poll that will show you - shows that America - that President Trump rather needs to make up some ground if he wants to win one of the most crucial battlegrounds of all. Trump 2020 Senior Advisor Steve Cortes on that strategy when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: We are in countdown mode now, 55 days to go until November 3rd and Joe Biden was in Michigan today, touting a buy American platform, the Former Vice President pitched a 10 percent tax that would penalize U.S. companies for off shoring jobs to other countries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I'm not looking to punish American business, but there's a better way. Make it in Michigan, make it in America, and invest in our communities and the workers and places like warren and we're going to make it happen with American grit, American determination, and American union workers. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The Former Vice President didn't take questions once again from the press, although many were quick to point out that the slogan he campaigned on today was the same one that was used by President Trump back in 2017. Joining me now is Steve Cortes, Trump Campaign Senior Advisor. STEVE CORTES, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Good evening. MACCALLUM: Steve, good to have you here tonight thanks for being here. So tell me what's going on in Michigan and why Joe Biden left Delaware to spend some time there today. CORTES: Yes, he got above ground, he came out of his basement and actually finally went to the State of Michigan a place that he hasn't been in six months. The reason he is going there clearly is politics because the race is tightening in Michigan as it is in most battleground states. But I have to say the gall of Joe Biden to go to the industrial heartland, to the State of Michigan and promise that he's going to return jobs back from China, that is like an arsonist who burned down a village returning to that town and promising the citizens of that town that he wants to be the fire marshal to protect them. Joe Biden spent a half century in the Washington swamp exporting American jobs all over the world, particularly to China. It is the one if we can call it that is the one accomplishment of his half-century in the beltway, is terrible trade deals particularly NAFTA and China's inclusion in the WTO which led by the way for the State of Michigan to a loss of a staggering 92,000 manufacturing jobs in the state alone. MACCALLUM: Well, it is clear that Michigan and most of the battleground states are tightening there is a report though from https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__goodjobsnation.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=4qM5RO6txy28lPwXj0mGWYPJnvkIvHMGKrpBaNgODeU&s=Quh7LSgnh4Ne_IFHxJFv57ij6R4EOgZHI0WXL285ipc&e= that says that there are actually more jobs have gone offshore during the Trump Administration than did annually under the Obama Administration, 13,241 jobs according to them versus 8,000 per year under Obama and Biden. What do you say to that? CORTES: Well look, I don't know the details of this report but I will say this - the job market that President Trump created in the first few years of his administration before the global economy was crashed by the China virus was an unparalleled job market particularly for blue-collar Americans, for those who had lagged behind during the slow growth of Obama/Biden years. I'm talking about minority folks with less education credentials, blue- collar workers, all of them sorted to the forefront of income and wage acceleration gains during the first three years of the Trump Administration. And what I would also say to make that our case or economic case to the American people is that right now, the man who created the conditions for the first Trump boom right now is creating the next economic renaissance for America, that's not my opinion, that's proven by the data. We got a fantastic jobs report out just last Friday, 1.4 million jobs added on the top line and even better than that-- MACCALLUM: Better than expected. CORTES: --and even better than the math. The wage acceleration 4.7 percent year-over-year wage acceleration. So the economic renascence has already commenced it is the Trump boom 2.0. MACCALLUM: Can I ask you about Florida before I let you go? Because interesting polls in Miami-Dade that shows that the Latino vote is leaning toward Trump in Miami-Dade County and every four years we have a demographic shift. You look at these counties and things change and shift in them. Florida looks like a dead heat right now, 48-48. What is your assessment of that and you know people look at that and they say well, that is the Cuban vote, it doesn't extrapolate to other states, what do you say? CORTES: Martha look, we are doing fantastic we're on a national level among Hispanics most polls were right around 40 percent. I believe that we can win the Hispanic vote nationally. And I'll tell you why there are a couple of reasons; one is kind of specific to Florida. A lot of Floridians who are of Hispanic descent either they themselves or their parents or ancestors, they fled countries that were corrupt socialist wastelands, places like Cuba and Venezuela and to some extent Nicaragua. So Florida Hispanics are particularly and clearly aware of and rightfully fearful of socialist policies, the kinds of policies that are being adopted now by the Democratic Party. And I would also say on a national basis, we Hispanics tend to be conservative people, religiously, culturally, and politically. With a lurch left award of the 20 Democratic Party, many Hispanics have been left behind as political orphans. This isn't your parents or your grandparents Democratic Party and because of that our campaign our party is aggressively reaching out to Hispanics. So far in polling its paying dividends and I think it continue to into Election Day. MACCALLUM: Yes, I think it's fascinating and something to watch for sure. Steve Cortes, thank you very much good to see you tonight. CORTES: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So in the past three months, more than a dozen police chiefs look at this list have resigned, stepped down from their post across the country in a stunning state of disarray that has left a lot of people as they walk the streets asking where are the police? How this happened and what is next with writer Deroy Murdock after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Significant portions of the police decent are people. But no one, there are a lot of bad folks in every organizations. TRUMP: Instead of standing up to the far left rioters, Biden condemns law enforcement and condemns America. He didn't even mention the words that we love and respect \"Law & Order.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: You know, they're all telling me, even my people, my very brilliant consultants so I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. Sir, please don't say law and order -- it's too tough. Now in the meantime, you look at the streets, people crazy. They say, say law and order but with safety and with -- I said, look, people get it, it's just law and order, is that OK? We want law and order. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: They say law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's a -- I said I don't want to add, that sort of obvious -- we want law, we want order. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: A cornerstone of President Trump's reelection bid intersecting at a moment when officers are leaving the force at an alarming rate. In the past three months, more than a dozen police chiefs, a dozen. Remember, Carmen Best, she was one of the first to leave her post after she tried her hardest in Seattle. Now you've Chief La'Ron Singletary of Rochester who resigned yesterday saying this. As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character. And he is not alone come across six major cities, roughly a thousand officers have retired it since May. In New York alone, there has been a 75 percent increase of officers filing retirement paperwork and let me tell you, you can feel it on the streets compared to the same time last year. So, it seems like this playout accused gunman Kyle Rittenhouse, remember this, who ran down the streets of Kenosha with a rifle? And remember, one of the things we noted when we watch this video that night, there was just no police anywhere and they are trying to figure out where are they, what's going on? He was later charged in a killing involving two people and that case is still being adjudicated. So, in New York, you've got firefighters who are stepping in, in this case they chased down a suspect who punched an old woman near their firehouse because the police -- there were no police around, so the firefighters went out and took care of it. So that's where we are in America right now. Here now is Deroy Murdock, contributing editor of the National Review online and a Fox News contributor. Deroy, I mean, you look at what's going on out there and you can kind of figure out why the message on the Democrat side is kind twisting and turning and trying to get around this issue to the point where you have Al Sharpton saying this. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We need to reimagine how we do policing. To take all policing off is something that I think a latte liberal may go for as they sit around the Hamptons discussing this as some academic problem. But people living on the ground need proper policing. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, I feel like I remember just not that long ago he was being cheered on at defund the police rallies, Deroy. DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. Martha, great to be with you. MACCALLUM: You too. MURDOCK: Now quite a change in the Al Sharpton song from yes, defund the police, and no justice no peace and now he's saying well, only people in the Hamptons believe that, we need proper policing. I think what we all want is proper policing, we want to reward good cops and if there are bad cops out there, they need to be either reprimanded or retrained, if they are really bad, they need to be punished. But this, as you mentioned something like a dozen police chiefs resigning, many of them actually black and female interestingly enough, in some cases both black and female, really astonishing. And it's -- I'm not surprised, I'm sad to see this but I'm not surprised to see them and rank-and-file cops saying, basically saying, look, you know, if we stick around, you know, at best we are going to get harassed and people taking, bringing out their video cameras and shooting everything they do. At worse, they got in trouble, they may get shot at, some of these people have bricks thrown at them, all sorts of, you know, frozen, bottles of frozen water, they get hauled in for lawsuits and so on. You know, I don't think we are giving our good cops the pat in the back they need, a lot of them are feeling frustrated and so they are packing up and getting out of there. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, it's -- (CROSSTALK) MURDOCK: And the criminals see this. That's the scariest part of it all. MACCALLUM: They do see that, and that's why they are running rampant on the streets. I mean, you know, one of our producers, you know, they see things in the subway that you can't believe right now and then in one case a woman was almost raped on a subway platform in New York City. There are photos of it. It's unbelievable what's going on. And if the leadership in these cities -- (CROSSTALK) MURDOCK: At 11.30 in the morning, mind you. MACCALLUM: That's right. That's exactly right. And if the leadership in these cities would have stood by their police officers and stood up for them, they would not be in the situation that they are in right now. But you know, it goes back to, in some sense, to this Jacob Blake case and Jacob Blake is speaking out now and saying something interesting from the hospital. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACOB BLAKE, SHOOTING SURVIVOR: There's a lot more life to live out here, you do not want to have to deal with this. Change your lives out there. We can stick together, make some money, make everything easier for our people out here, man because there's so much time that has been wasted. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What did you think of that comment, Deroy? So much time has been wasted, we've got to make some money, we got to get together for our people. MURDOCK: Yes. Well, that's a positive message. I mean, he is a man with a pretty shady record and a bit of a rap sheet and all that. MACCALLUM: It's true. MURDOCK: But I like that positive message, we should have more of that positive message. I wish we should hear that from Democrat mayors and Democrat governors, many of whom are looking the other way as these crimes go on. MACCALLUM: Yes. MURDOCK: We've got prosecutors who don't seem to have any interest in locking people up who commit crimes. They are now saying well, if you looted maybe we need to find out whether you needed the stuff you looted. MACCALLUM: Yes. MURDOCK: So, if you really needed a high definition TV maybe you ought to keep it and we shouldn't bother prosecuting you. MACCALLUM: Unbelievable. MURDOCK: I mean, all the messages are saying to the criminals keep doing what you're doing and tell the cops stand down. MACCALLUM: Yes. MURDOCK: And guess what happened. The cops are standing down and the criminals are stepping up. MACCALLUM: Well, you have to wonder, just going back to Jacob Blake, how the woman who is the mother of his children who claims that he sexually assaulted her then robbed her of her car keys and her debit card and spent $500 twice on it while she was calling the police, then there's people holding a vigil outside at her house for him. Now what happened to him is separate, that's being investigated. But to -- for Kamala Harris to say, you know, I'm so proud of Jacob Blake, this is a person who, you know, has said that we have to believe all women, doesn't that seem a little, a little off to you? MURDOCK: More than a little off. Look, it's one thing to say we are sorry this guy got in a situation, he is paralyzed for the rest of his life. MACCALLUM: Yes. MURDOCK: I don't think anybody is gleeful about that. MACCALLUM: No. MURDOCK: But remember, the cops were at that house because there was a warrant for his arrest, the mother of his children as you said called the cops and said here he is again, the guy who allegedly sexually assaulted her, she felt threatened, and the cops showed up not because they wanted to attack a black man but because a black woman was complaining about somebody possibly putting her in danger. MACCALLUM: Yes. MURDOCK: The cops were doing what they were supposed to do, and obviously things went south and here we are. MACCALLUM: Yes. And you have to wonder in some of these cities who is going to answer those calls at this point for this woman -- MURDOCK: Absolutely. MACCALLUM: -- who needed help. Before I let you go, I want to play another one of the audiotapes from the Bob Woodward book which all of it have been getting a lot of play today, but this one is of interest and I want to hear your thoughts on this. Here we go. (BEGIN VOICE CLIP) BOB WOODWARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Any sense that that privilege is isolated and put you in a cage to a certain extent as it put me in, I think lots of white, privilege people in a cage? TRUMP: No. You really drink the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you. Wow. No, I don't feel that at all. (END VOICE CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think about that, Deroy? MURDOCK: Yes. Look, I think it's true. You look at, true that the president hasn't had the Kool-Aid, if you will. This is the president who signed the First Step Act which is a criminal justice reform effort that has taken a lot of nonviolent criminals overwhelmingly black and let them have a second chance at life, gotten out of prison on many of them are doing very well. This is the president who signed the Opportunity Zone Act which is part of the Tax Cut -- Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 8,700 opportunity zones, many of them in low income areas, many of them in black and Hispanic areas where people are seeing $75 billion in investment, all creating jobs and bringing the economy back. And this is the president who has provided a steady stream of income for historically black colleges and universities, that's something they begged for under Obama/Biden that they didn't get. They got it out of President Trump. So, whether he's privileged or not, or drink the Kool-Aid or not, he's done very, very good things for black folks including by the way, the lowest unemployment rate for black Americans in U.S. history. MACCALLUM: Deroy Murdock, always great to talk to you, sir. Thank you very much. Good to have you here. MURDOCK: Martha, great talking to you. Thank you. MACCALLUM: See you soon. Coming up, President Trump revealing what the Supreme Court could look like if there is another vacancy during his second term, coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: President Trump revealed the names of 20 people that he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court in the event of another vacancy, a move intended to get Joe Biden to also release the names of the people he would consider if he won the election. White House correspondent Kevin Corke has that story for us tonight from Washington. Hi, Kevin. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. Just how important is that list of potential nominees? Well, consider this. Four of the nine justices are 70 or older including two Ginsberg, 87, and Breyer, 82, who are in fact over 80. Now the list also includes three sitting U.S. senators. Republican Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Hawley for his part said today he wouldn't be interested in such an appointment, while Cotton, perhaps not coincidentally on Twitter today wrote, it's time for Roe v. Wade to go. Now the list of judges and lawmakers of 20 it also includes a number of highly regarded and well-known judges including Amy Coney Barrett, she is a circuit judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Here is the president this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: There's a growing radical left movement that rejects the principle of equal treatment under the law. If this extreme movement is granted a majority on the Supreme Court, it will fundamentally transform America. (END VIDEO CLIP) CORKE: The president also derided his 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden for not releasing his own list of SCOTUS nominee potentials, claiming he hadn't done so because his candidates wouldn't, quote, \"while they'd be so far-left they couldn't withstand public scrutiny.\" Here is Biden on the subject back in June. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are putting together a list of a group of African-American women who are qualified and have the experience to be in the court. I am not going to release that until we go further down the line of vetting them as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) CORKE: Very interesting nugget here for you, Martha, at least I thought so. Exit polling after 2016 showed 70 percent of Americans set appointments to the high court were the most important or an important factor in deciding their vote which could in fact shape 2020 as we look ahead. MACCALLUM: Yes. CORKE: Now there is what, 55 days or so, Martha. MACCALLUM: Yes. That's a fascinating number and it is a big issue for a lot of voters. CORKE: You bet. MACCALLUM: Kevin, thank you. CORKE: You bet. MACCALLUM: Good to see you. CORKE: You too. MACCALLUM: So, coming up, former FBI agent Peter Strzok who famously said of a Trump presidency, quote, \"we will stop it\" and lead the investigation into possible collusion now says that he still thinks that the president is compromised by Russia. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on that and much more tonight when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Byron York today pointing out the glaring misstep among those who pushed the Trump-Russia collusion narrative in 2016 writing this. The Trump-Russia affair was about one big allegation, that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election, there was a huge investigation. It could never establish that the crime even took place, much less who might have committed it. Every other problem Mueller and Democrats faced stemmed from that one failure. Now we are hearing a similar tune from some who led the charge four years ago and came up empty-handed. Here is disgraced FBI agent Peter Strzok who claims that the president is still compromised and a threat in his new book. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID MARTIN, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, CBS NEWS: You know it's going to put you back in the crosshairs. PETER STRZOK, FORMER FBI AGENT: I do. MARTIN: Is it going to be worth it? STRZOK: Yes. David, this is a threat that we have not faced in our modern history. What Russia is doing, what they did in 2016 to attack our election, to help Trump, what they are doing now to do the very same thing is something every American ought to be thinking about and considering. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Sarah Huckabee -- Sarah Huckabee Sanders joins me now, former White House press secretary, Fox News contributor and author of her new book \"Speaking for Myself: Faith, Freedom, and the Fight of Our Lives Inside the Trump White House.\" Sarah, congratulations on the book, and welcome. Good to have you with us tonight. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, I want to play another sound bite actually from Peter Strzok, and this one is from an appearance on MSNBC this morning. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STRZOK: I think the truth with President Trump lies in the middle, do I think he's a Manchurian candidate? I don't. Do I think that he's doing things that are not in the national interest security of the United States because of the things that Russia holds over him because he does not want known? Absolutely, I believe that. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Sarah, what do you say? SANDERS: I mean, I find it just absolutely almost -- I'm speechless that after two years wasted of taxpayer time and resources, they are still pushing this false narrative. I spent an entire chapter of my book talking about the Russia witch hunt. Let's not forget, unlike the Obama administration, the Trump administration actually took a hard line against Russia, imposing tough sanctions, expelling diplomats, putting -- isolating and sanctioning Russia's closest proxies, Iran and Venezuela, becoming energy independent and hurting Russia's economy, putting an influx of cash and putting pressure on other countries to step up their commitments to NATO. Moment after moment, every opportunity this president has taken a much harder line on Russia than the previous administration. He rebuilt our military making sure our adversaries couldn't and wouldn't challenge us. The idea they are still pushing, this absurd narrative after two years -- MACCALLUM: Yes. SANDERS: -- is total B.S. And he should be embarrassed to continue pushing this message, this should never again happen to another American presidents. MACCALLUM: Yes. I'm shocked that, you know, he's not saying that the Mueller investigation and the people who worked on it were terrible because obviously, they worked for over two years and spent millions of dollars. So, I don't know why he's not incredibly outraged that all of the people on that team were unable to find what he is so sure is in there somewhere. So, they seem to attack everybody except that the people that, you know, who were assigned to dig into and spend every breathing minute of 24, 24/7 trying to find something that he claimed absolutely is there, so I guess they failed on that front. You know, it is not over because now Adam Schiff is coming forward again and there's a new whistleblower that is talking about a related issue here and Adam Schiff says this. We've received a whistleblower complaint alleging DHS suppressed intel reports on a Russian election interference, altered intel to match false Trump claims and made false statements to Congress. This puts our national security at risk and we will investigate. And also, just a short time ago, a DHS professional, former chief of staff says that President Trump demanded the firing of the person at DHS who said that yes, indeed, it was Trump that the Russians wanted to win that election and that he wanted that person out. Can you tell us what you remember about -- about that incident? SANDERS: What I remember is that Adam Schiff lost all of his credibility after he spent more than two years pushing false claims guaranteeing that he had the smoking gun which he never produced. Adam Schiff cannot continue pushing this ridiculous fake news. At some point, I think he would have learned by now but I guess not. But I think the American people have, and I think they have tuned him out because they know he has no credibility, especially not on this topic after promising for two years that he would produce something and never once did. MACCALLUM: Did the president call for the firing or the resignation of that person who came forward and wanted to put that in that report that it was President Trump that Russia wanted to win? SANDERS: Not that I am aware of. I was never part of any discussion where the president asked for that to happen. But again, what I do know is that any election interference that took place in 2016 happened under Obama's watch. This president has actually taken a hard line on Russia and done things to protect our election security. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Congratulations on the book. Sarah, thank you. More on THE STORY right after this. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: That's THE STORY for this Wednesday, September 9th, 2020. Thanks for spending your evening with us. THE STORY continues, though. So, we'll see you back here tomorrow at 7 for President Trump's rally in Michigan. Have a great night, everybody. See you then.

BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Took the wind out of it, that was good. Thanks, Jesse. Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump says he did not lie to the American people about the coronavirus. That statement coming one day after the president acknowledged he underplayed the seriousness of the operate to avoid panic after saying as much at the beginning of the crisis on tape to author Bob Woodward. We will hear more from the president, from former Vice President Joe Biden and the top media managers for both campaigns a little bit later. We begin tonight though with this breaking story, Microsoft is declaring the same Russians who tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential race in the U.S. are at it again, but they're not alone. Other countries are taking part in trying to sow digital chaos in the election. The Intel Community has been saying this, but tonight's story comes from a company, Microsoft. Correspondent Gillian Turner has our top story tonight. Good evening, Gillian. GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Gillian. So, breaking this evening, Microsoft is disclosing a massive hacking effort directed at the U.S. presidential 2020 campaign. The company says that for months since March. China Iran -- China-Iran, excuse me, as well as Russia have been targeting both the Trump and the Biden campaigns, as well as hundreds of people and organizations and groups that work with those campaigns. Now, the company claims they're finding makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election. Microsoft believes the Russian military backpacking group called Fancy Bear now infamous for attacks on the DNC and Clinton campaigns back in 2016 is more capable than ever and it started using what's known as brute force cyber attacks. They say Chinese hackers targeted Biden's campaign and at least one former Trump administration official while Iran focus more exclusively on the Trump campaign. Microsoft didn't disclose the total number of attacks that have occurred but claimed there were thousands of targets between March and June, including both candidates, campaign staff, campaign consultants, U.S. and Europe policy groups, as well as think tanks. Now, key senators like Ben Sasse say it's well known that China prefers Biden to win in 2020 while Russia prefers a second term for President Trump. An official from the office of the director of National Intelligence tells Fox News this evening, they welcome Microsoft's assistance and will continue partnering with them to combat foreign efforts. The revelations come at a sensitive moment amid an investigation prompted by a whistleblower complaint which claims the Trump administration is suppressing intelligence about Russian election interference, something the White House denied to Bret Baier just last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We sanction more Russians than any administration in history. But I'll tell you one thing that -- you know, China is a serious threat to our elections. Iran is a serious threat to the free and fair elections here. (END VIDEO CLIP) TURNER: Tonight, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, that's Chad Wolf, is affirming the validity of Microsoft's new reporting. He says, all these threats are known to the U.S. government and DHS has been warning American voters about them for some months. He also goes on to say that he supports, and the entire department supports and applauds Microsoft's efforts to help keep the 20 election -- 2020 election safe and that the government will work with them hand in glove going forward, Bret. BAIER: Gillian, thank you. We'll follow this. Another breaking story, we learned a few moments ago, a panel of federal judges has blocked President Trump's July directive to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the 2020 census. That decision means the Census Bureau must count illegal immigrants when turning over figures used to calculate how many congressional seats each state gets. The administration will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Also breaking tonight, President Trump is on his way to Michigan. You're looking there live. Another battleground state that will help decide who wins the November election. Back here in Washington, the fallout continues over the president's admission, he downplayed the dangers of the coronavirus outbreak. Now, he's insisting he did not lie. The fact that was he says to avoid panic. We will talk with the top media people from the Trump and Biden campaign shortly. But first, we check in with chief White House correspondent John Roberts on the North Lawn. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. President Trump said earlier this afternoon he decided to speak with Bob Woodward for his new book because he thought it would be \"Interested\". And while the president said today, he doesn't know if the book is good or bad, he has already described it as a political hit job. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: At his daily called White House Press Conference, President Trump today reacting angrily to suggestions he lied to the American people about coronavirus. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't lie, what I said is we have to be calm; we can't be panicked. ROBERTS: In the new Bob Woodward book Rage, Woodward says President Trump told him in February the coronavirus was worse than the flu, then told him the following month, he was playing down the severity of the virus so as not to cause a panic. TRUMP: Outwardly, I said, it's a very serious problem. And it's always a serious problem, that doesn't mean I'm going to jump up and down in the air and start saying people are going to die, people are going to die. No, I'm not going to do that. ROBERTS: The president also putting the onus back on Woodward saying, if he was so concerned about what the president was saying, why did he wait six months to put it in a book rather than reporting on it back in March? TRUMP: If he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it because he thinks that -- you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact. ROBERTS: Democrats kept up the drumbeat of criticism today, Nancy Pelosi claiming the president's public posture cost American lives. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The president knew. He'd been saying for a long time, the whole thing was a hoax. His delay denial and distortion of what was happening has caused many deaths. ROBERTS: But at the same time Woodward was having his conversations with President Trump, Democrats were also playing down the threat from the virus. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is no reason to panic. PELOSI: Come to Chinatown. Here we are. We're again careful, safe. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not a time to panic about coronavirus but coronavirus is a serious public health challenge. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: For the vast majority of New Yorkers, life is going on pretty normally right now and we want to encourage that. ROBERTS: The president's response to coronavirus is just one controversial moment in the book. Another did the president revealed the existence of a top secret nuclear weapon to Woodward. Woodward quotes the president as saying, I have built a nuclear weapon system that nobody's ever had in this country before. We have stuff you haven't even seen or heard about. We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. Woodward also asks the president if people who grew up in white privilege have a responsibility to do more to understand the pain and anger African Americans feel in the wake of police killings. BOB WOODWARD, REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": No, you really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you. Wow. No, I don't feel that at all. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: On his way to Michigan tonight, President Trump stopped the (INAUDIBLE) Sanders to talk briefly to the press pool where he appeared to confirm that the United States does have nuclear weapons that people don't know about but he refused to elaborate. The president will try to change the subject back to comparing and contrasting himself and his policies with those of Joe Biden at a political rally in Freeland just north of Saginaw Michigan, Bret. BAIER: John, thank you. A coronavirus relief bill offered by Senate Republican leadership shut down by Senate Democrats in a procedural vote. The Democratic filibuster prevented that from going forward. The vote was 52 to 47, did not meet the 60-vote threshold needed to proceed. More on that with panel in a bit. Joe Biden continuing to hammer President Trump over his coronavirus response. Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story tonight from Wilmington, Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden believes when it comes to the president's pandemic response inaction has consequences. BIDEN: Kick him out of office is the consequence. DOOCY: And Biden believes Trump's inaction goes beyond just political malpractice. BIDEN: He didn't do a damn thing, think about it. Think about what he did not do and he's almost criminal. DOOCY: The Biden campaign is now saying President Trump is the reason they still hosted packed rallies until mid-March. BILL RUSSO, BIDEN CAMPAIGN DEPUTY-COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Maybe if the president of the United States hadn't been lying about the extent of the crisis that we were facing, we would have had different information to make different decisions. DOOCY: That's even though Biden claims to have known how severe things would be months earlier. BIDEN: I all the way back to January warned them this pandemic was coming. I talked about what we needed to do. DOOCY: Today, Biden took a break from the campaign trail as Kamala Harris courted African-American voters in Florida. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're going to be here today for a bunch of meetings, but I'm going to call on you all, you truly are the future of our country. DOOCY: Florida is in focus for the Democratic ticket as Biden plans to visit Tuesday. But another state maybe more important, Michigan. BIDEN: And so, this comes from the gut for me and I'm going to be coming back. I'm going to be back in the state at least two or three more times because it's a must win state. DOOCY: Relatively early in the pandemic, Joe Biden tried to size up President Trump's response with this. \"Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete an unjustifiable dereliction of duty\". Now, the Bob Woodward's recordings prove there were early briefings, Biden is changing his tune about Trump. BIDEN: He saw the reports. He knew them in detail. At least we know he can read. I mean, think about it. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Joe Biden also repeated his belief, the virus is not Trump's fault, but the deaths are. He did not have any public appearances today but in the last 24 hours, his posture concerning COVID has been more about what Trump didn't do just after Super Tuesday and less about what Biden would do after his own inauguration day if elected, Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy, thanks. We are talking this evening with the top media representatives for each of the presidential candidates. First up tonight, TJ Ducklo national press secretary for the Biden campaign. TJ, thanks for being on. TJ DUCKLO, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN: Hi, Bret, thanks for having me. BAIER: You heard Peter's piece; I want to start with what the former vice president specifically would have done at the end of January? Had he received the briefing that we know now the president received January 28th? DUCKLO: Sure. Well, Bret, we know that -- you know, here we are in the United States of America. We are four percent of the world's population. We are 20 percent of the COVID cases. We are 25 percent of the COVID deaths. And we now know from Bob Woodward's reporting as you just covered, that this president knowingly and willfully lied about the dangerousness of the threat that face this country. We know from Columbia University, had this president taking action just a few weeks earlier, we would have tens of thousands of lives that would have been saved. You know, while the president was out there calling it a hoax while he was saying that the virus would magically disappear, he knew. He knew, Bret. He knew that how dangerous the threat that we are facing was. Joe Biden -- Joe Biden from the very beginning in March has put out very clear plans about what he would do to get our -- BAIER: Correct, but we're talking about in January because here his two top advisers, two of them that are -- he listens too closely, Ron Klain and Zeke Emanuel on January 28th and January 30th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you ban Chinese travelers from arriving in the United States? RON KLAIN, CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I wouldn't, I think that's premature. DR. ZEKE EMANUEL, CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL ETHICS AND HEALTH POLICY: Everyone in America should take a very big breath slow down and stop panicking and being his -- (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And it goes on. I mean, they continue to make comments that masks are not necessary at the moment, this is overreaction that goes into February and early March. So, understanding that those of the people he listens to and Joe Biden has said he wouldn't have closed the travel from China. What specifically would the former vice president have done? DUCKLO: Well, let's get a few things straight. The vice president was not against the travel ban, first of all. Second of all, let's remember an important -- BAIER: He wasn't? DUCKLO: Bret, let's remember an important distinction, Donald Trump was the president of the United States. It was on Donald Trump to -- BAIER: I'm asking you if Joe Biden was the president of the United States, if he was. DUCKLO: It was on Donald Trump to take action to actually protect the American people. BAIER: He closed the travel to China. DUCKLO: Joe Biden wrote an op-ed in USA Today in January warning that the threat was coming. Joe Biden said in February that Donald Trump should get people on the ground in China. What did -- what did Donald Trump do? Donald Trump was praising China. Donald Trump was praising President Xi's response, saying that they had it under control, when clearly he knew as we now know from Bob Woodward, they did not have it under control. He should have been protecting the American people. He should have been putting real plans in place to act and confront this incredibly dangerous threat. BAIER: I understand. Let me just clarify, your saying that Joe Biden was for closing down travel from China when the president did it? DUCKLO: Joe Biden has been clear. And I can send you the fact checks if they're helpful, Bret. Joe Biden has been clear that he was not against that travel ban at the time. BAIER: But he was for it? DUCKLO: Joe Biden has been clear about this, Bret. Again, I can send -- I can send you the fact checks if they're helpful. This has been fact checked into oblivion. BAIER: OK, I'm just asking the question. You're saying yes, he was for the China travel ban when the president implemented it to 48 hours after receiving that briefing? DUCKLO: The important thing about the travel ban -- BAIER: Yes or no? Yes or no, TJ? DUCKLO: Bret, I know that you all like to cite the travel ban. I know the president like to cite the travel ban. BAIER: No, no, no, the president does, that's why I'm bringing it up. Obviously, it's going to be in the debate. DUCKLO: Bret, hold on, the important thing to know about the travel ban is that even after the president implemented that travel ban, tens -- or says that he implemented it, tens of thousands of people came in and out of the country. BAIER: OK, I'm going to take it that you're not going to answer that question. You're going to send me some fact checks. DUCKLO: What was Donald Trump doing, Bret? He was -- he was ignoring the virus. He was praising China. BAIER: Let's continue the fact check. DUCKLO: Go ahead. BAIER: Let's continue the fact check. Here's what Doctor Fauci said when asked if there was a discrepancy with what the president said privately and what the president said publicly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I may not be tuned into the right thing that they're talking about, but I didn't really see any discrepancies between what he told us and what we told him and what he ultimately came out publicly and said. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, is Doctor Fauci wrong? DUCKLO: Bret, I know that it's -- you all are working overtime to try to find excuses for this president. We know from the president's own words; he knew how serious this threat was. He did not implement the necessary steps to get testing to where we needed. To get contact tracing to where we needed. To actually mobilize PPE and get that around to hospitals around the country. This president failed the American people when we needed it most. BAIER: OK, I'm just asking you specific questions about what's happening over the past couple of days. Joe Biden has said, and you mentioned it, that if President Trump had acted two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives would have been saved in March and April. But if President acted two weeks earlier and shut everything down, Super Tuesday primaries would have been affected, wouldn't they? And making it harder for Biden to catch Bernie Sanders to become the nominee. You are not calling; he was not calling for the stop of the Super Tuesday primaries. DUCKLO: Well, again, Bret, I will remind you of the distinction I made earlier which is that, Donald Trump is the president. BAIER: I know, but had he acted, your guy might not be the nominee, correct? DUCKLO: I understand that it's my -- it might be useful to like engage in hypotheticals like that you are doing. Donald Trump was the president, he had the information, he lied about it. It's quite simply that simple. BAIER: OK, let me a move on. You had interview today, the former vice president did, he told Jake Tapper that he would raise corporate taxes on day one in office regardless of the unemployment rate what it was at the time. One, is that good politics and two, how would he do that? DUCKLO: Well, look, I think the vice president has been clear that he's going to stand up for the middle class. That he's going to be there for working families and that he is going to prioritize them in everything he does. As you know, Bret, you all have covered, the vice president rolled out his plan for an economic recovery in July, how we're going to build back this country not just to where we for before the coronavirus but to build back better. He's laid out his entire vision for that economic recovery over the course of July. Investing in manufacturing. Investing in our care givers. Investing in a clean energy economy. It's -- you know, it's something that we talk often about because that's one of the jobs of the president, is to get Americans back to work in the middle of this -- of this economic crisis as well as this pandemic. BAIER: There will be a lot of time to go into specifics. I wanted to ask you about NAFTA and what he said about all of that today because it's important in a lot of states, but I want to keep it fair on time. End with this, has Joe Biden ever used a teleprompter during local interviews or to answer Q&A with supporters? DUCKLO: Bret, we are not going to engage -- this is -- this is straight from the Trump campaign. BAIER: Well, yes, they're using it. DUCKLO: And what it does -- and what it does, Bret, is it's trying to distract the American people. BAIER: I'm just -- they're using it, they talk about it every day, can you say yes or no? DUCKLO: That's -- they talk about it every day, Bret, because they don't have a coherent strategy -- BAIER: Will you have an answer, yes or no? DUCKLO: Bret, they talk about it every day because they don't have a coherent argument for why Donald Trump deserves reelection, deserves four more years. We know that he lied to the American people, we know that he has not showed leadership during this crisis and they are desperate to throw anything they can against the wall to try to distract from that fact. BAIER: I understand, but you can't answer the question? DUCKLO: Bret, I am not going to allow -- BAIER: OK. DUCKLO: -- the Trump campaign to funnel their questions through Fox News and get me to respond to that. BAIER: Well, TJ, we appreciate your time and thank you for coming on. DUCKLO: Thanks, Bret. BAIER: Next up this evening Tim Murtaugh, director of communications from the Trump campaign. First of all, you just heard what was said. They're coming hard after the president for what he said to Bob Woodward and what he said on the record. TIM MURTAUGH, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Well, Bret, I mean, what you heard there from TJ Ducklo is that he couldn't articulate an answer to your question of, what would Joe Biden have done differently? And we know without a quit -- without question that President Trump's move to restrict travel from China save thousands of American lives, Doctor Fauci says so. All medical experts say so and we know that Joe Biden would not have done that. He called it hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering. And what you have now with the -- in the wake of the excerpts from the Bob Woodward book is that, I think what's happening, what's got everybody all excited is that's all packaged up and it says Bob Woodward's name on the cover. But in fact, the things that are contained in there are the same things that President Trump was saying publicly. He views it as part of his job as president of the United States. BAIER: That's not true. It's not true. When he was saying publicly that the virus would go from 15 to zero, and then it was magically going to wash away. That is not the same thing he's telling Bob Woodward that it's a deadly virus that travels over the air and it's really serious and I like to downplay it. He was not saying the same things publicly as he was privately to Bob Woodward. MURTAUGH: It was public knowledge at the time. The Washington Post and others and it was discussed in coronavirus briefings. Everyone knew that it was transmitted through things like coughing and sneezing. BAIER: OK, but what you just said was whether what you're saying privately and publicly is the same, it's not. MURTAUGH: Doctor Fauci says it is the same. You just played the sound bite from him. Doctor Fauci said he (INAUDIBLE) difference between what the president was discussing privately versus what he was saying publicly, you just played the sound bite from Doctor Fauci. BAIER: With Fauci, not Bob Woodward. I want to move on. Let me -- let me just -- MURTAUGH: The question is was the president being straight with the American people and he was. BAIER: OK, Democrats -- MURTAUGH: Every step of the way, the president was straight with the American people, there was no question of that. BAIER: Democrats are jumping on the fact that they think there is a disparity here that he says he didn't want to cause panic. And yet, when he talks about trouble in the suburbs where he talks about uprisings by Antifa and the fact that when he says Joe Biden, if he gets elected, it's going to destroy all these places that he is talking about panic. MURTAUGH: Well, Bret, I don't think that anybody who watches the evening news for example over the last 100 plus days out of Portland and see cities burning to the ground. I don't think calling attention to that is inciting panic. I think who is causing the concern are the left-wing agitators, these are Joe Biden aligned protesters who are burning down American cities. President Trump is just calling attention to what in fact has actually happened. And the fact that Joe Biden has been too weak to call out the fact that these Antifa thugs are aligned with his campaign and with the anti-police wing of the Democrat Party. Joe Biden's too weak to stand up to them because they're in control of his party, they're in control of his campaign and he doesn't dare speak out against them. So, Americans can see for themselves on at home, on T.V. every night, is just what the president is seeing and drawing attention to. BAIER: Tim, you know, I know there's a push back by the president and others in the campaign about polls. You are trailing in the average of polls in the key battleground states and I know there's all kinds of talk about the polls. But this is one thing you can't dispute, and that is absentee ballot requests. In Florida, Democrats have 2,029,000 roughly, Republicans 1,300,000. No party affiliation 828,000. In North Carolina absentee requests, Democrats 379,000, Republicans 122. Are you trailing in that effort? I got to (INAUDIBLE) quick. I have to hit a break. MURTAUGH: We're working very hard. Our GOTV does is working on things all the way from absentee balloting, all the way up to Election Day. There are also polls that show that a lot of Trump supporters plan to vote in-person on Election Day. We're fighting for every single vote and we know for example that this is the reason why we wanted to have the debates earlier so that people can actually see the two candidates side by side before people start voting. They have ballots in their hands in North Carolina now. BAIER: The computer's going to cut us off, Tim. You're always welcome back. Thank you very much for the time. MURTAUGH: Thanks Bret. BAIER: We'll be back after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: The Justice Department has charged 57 people since May with trying to steal more than $175 million from the Paycheck Protection Program designed to help Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. Officials say they've identified 500 individuals who may have defrauded the $660 billion program. We had a rough day on Wall Street today, the Dow dropped 406, the S&P 500 lost 60, the NASDAQ finished down 222. Breaking tonight, thousands of homes are being threatened tonight by a wildfire in Northern California. Thousands more people are being affected by fires up and down the West Coast. Have you seen these images out there with the orange skies? Correspondent Jeff Paul shows us tonight from Monrovia, California. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Months of tinder dry conditions added to days of high winds and hot temperatures creating a perfect fire storm across the west. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely the most intense one that I've been at. PAUL: More than 90 major fires are burning in 13 states, scorching an area the size of the state of Connecticut according to the National Fire Information Center. California is one of the hardest hit with a record breaking three million acres burned and nearly 4,000 homes in buildings lost so far. A 12-year old boy and his grandmother are among the latest deaths. The flames are spreading so fast, it really doesn't give people much time to get out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was so fast; it sounds like a jet plane. You know, I was -- it was fire, 360 degrees around me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Someplace in that pile there, I had my mother's rings, tore my heart up. PAUL: The fires also taking a toll in Washington state where more than 100 homes are gone. And a 1-year old boy died has his family trying to flee the flames. After touring the damage, the state's governor linked the relentless fires to climate change. GOV. JAY INSLE (D-WA): This is the result of catastrophically danger climatic systems which have left us exposed to these horrendous fires. PAUL: And in Oregon, more than 35 fires are burning with at least five small towns destroyed. Resources across the west are stretched thin. HILARY FRANZ, WASHINGTON COMMISSIONER, PUBLIC LANDS: I have men and women who are doing everything possible to get these fires contained under very, very difficult condition with very lean teams. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAUL: And it's not just flames from the fire that are devastating, huge plumes of smoke are creating poor air quality levels, as well as grounding firefighting aircraft from completing missions because pilots simply cannot see, Bret. BAIER: Jeff Paul live in Monrovia. Jeff, thank you. Up next, are you ready for some football? And NFL season unlike any other begins tonight. We'll look at the challenges ahead. But yes, we're ready. First, here's some -- what some Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fix 2 in Detroit as more than half million Michigan workers who provide essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic have the opportunity to go to college without paying tuition. Funding for the program draws in $24 million investment from the governor's education emergency relief fund, which is part of the CARES Act. And this is a live look at Salt Lake City from Fox 13. One of the big stories there tonight, six western states that rely on the Colorado River to sustain cities and farms are criticizing a plan to build an underground pipeline that would transport billions of gallons of water through the desert to Southwest Utah. The states are urging the federal government to halt the approval process for this river project. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT, we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Tonight the National Football League kicks off what is going to a most unusual season. The games resume amid a worldwide pandemic, of course, and that will keep most fans from attending in person, and during a national focus on racial issues. The league is also dealing with open hostility from the president and his supporters, but it's going forward tonight. Here's correspondent Kevin Corke. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Like so much else in 2020, the NFL season, kicking off tonight, will be unlike anything we've ever seen before. And the empty or near empty stadiums that will greet the games aren't the half of it. This season will be shaped as much by the summer's unrest as it is by the COVID-19 pandemic. Out are cheerleaders, mascots, and sideline reporters. In are end zones with the words \"It takes all of us,\" and End racism,\" and very likely widespread kneeling during the National Anthem. ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER: We're not here to make political statements. We're here to help make our communities better. TROY AIKMAN, FOX SPORTS NFL ANALYST: We could all learn, we could all learn a lot, certainly Washington could, from the way teams are able to come together and put aside their differences and work towards a common goal. CORKE: The goal, not just football, says Aikman, but unity, an ambitious endeavor coming at perhaps in the country's most disharmonious period since 1861. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They can protest in other ways. They shouldn't protest our flag or our country. CORKE: Of course, it's far more than just personal for President Trump. It's also political. In fact, he's made no secret of his disdain for athletes who use the anthem to protest, recently tweeting that it's \"a sign of great disrespect for our country and our flag.\" \"Goodbye, NFL. I'm gone,\" tweeted the president's son Eric this week. Still, recent polling suggests that's the Trumps' posture on protests is out of step with a growing number of Americans. Asked if athletes should use their platform to express views on national issues, 62 percent of those responding told \"The Washington Post\" they should, 56 percent said it was appropriate for players to kneel during the anthem to protest racial inequality, 42 percent said it's not. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: The defending Super Bowl champions Kansas City Chiefs, who are set to take on the Houston Texans in front of a relatively sparse, COVID limited crowd at Arrowhead Stadium, Bret. We're told that capacity will be roughly around 22 percent, Bret. BAIER: I'll be watching. Kevin, thanks. CORKE: You bet. BAIER: Let's take a closer look at the journalists' issues surrounding the Woodward book and what the president talked about today, criticizing the author's decision to sit on some of the revelations until he was ready to publish, revelations about what the president said. Here is FOX News media analyst and Host of FOX's \"Media Buzz,\" Howard Kurtz. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: Bob Woodward became famous relying on the Watergate source Deep Throat, but the key source in his new book \"Rage\" is on the record and on tape, which is why yesterday's excerpt sparked a media furor. BOB WOODWARD, JOURNALIST: You went through a pivot on this to, oh, my God, the gravity is almost inexplicable and unexplainable. KURTZ: Much of the media is flatly accusing the president of lying about the severity of the coronavirus that he confided to Woodward in early February. Other pundits are backing the president's account that he was trying to avoid a panic. CARL BERNSTEIN, JOURNALIST: It is a dereliction of duty recorded as no other presidential dereliction of duty has been, even more so than the Nixon tapes. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: You would think that these so called journalists in the media might have realized that the president wouldn't talk on the record with Woodward about something he was trying to hide. KURTZ: Though media accusation dominated today's briefing? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why did you lie to the American people, and why should we trust what you have to say now? DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's a terrible question, and the phraseology. I didn't lie. The way you phrased that is such a disgrace. It's a disgrace to ABC television network. KURTZ: The president tweeted today if Woodward thought their conversations \"were so bad or dangerous, why didn't he immediately report them in an effort to save lives?\" \"The Washington Post\" reporter told his paper he needed time to verify Trump's account and put it in context. A \"Times\" review calls the portion of Trump \"immediately recognizable to anyone paying even the minimal amount of attention. Trump refused to cooperate with Woodward's last book, but this time he was calling the author at night for some of their 18 interviews, the book quoting him as telling his wife Melania it will probably be atrocious, but that's OK. The president has been hit with a series of hostile books, by his convicted lawyer Michael Cohen, ex-aide John Bolton, fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, his niece, Mary Trump. One difference, Woodward had cooperation from Jared Kushner and other top aides. (END VIDEOTAPE) KURTZ: Is the back, as the president charges, a political hit job? The last sentence breaks with Woodward's usual just the facts approach, declaring that Trump is the wrong man for the job. But it's also packed with lengthy presidential quotes so readers can make up their own mind. Bret? BAIER: Howie, thanks. Long awaited peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government begin Saturday in Qatar. The terrorist group and Qatar's foreign ministry made that announcement today. The talks were laid out in a peace deal brokered by the U.S. The secretary of state is heading there, and he'll be there on hand. Up next, two politicians undefeated in their home state of Colorado slug it out for the Senate seat. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: This starts a series of reports about Senate races around the country, and we're going to bounce all around. The Senate race in Colorado shaping up as a heavyweight battle. Both contenders are undefeated in their state going in. Senior correspondent Alicia Acuna handicaps the contest tonight from Denver. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neither Republican Senator Cory Gardner nor former Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper has ever lost a Colorado race. SEN. CORY GARDNER, (R-CO): I cross party lines to get things done. ACUNA: Democrats have had their eye on Gardner since his upset victory in 2014. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hickenlooper knows now is the time for action, not vacation. ACUNA: Hickenlooper finished two terms in the governor's office with high approval ratings, popularity that did not translate to the presidential trail. At the time he brushed off the idea of challenging Gardner, telling \"Politico,\" quote, \"I'm not cut out to be a senator.\" Race rankings have strongly favored the Democrat in this highly independent state. JOHN FRANK, \"COLORADO SUN\": The trick with unaffiliates here in Colorado is they're the largest voting bloc, and how they go each election is very much dependent on the national mood, on the current political mood. ACUNA: Both candidates have hurdles. An ethics commissioner found Hickenlooper violated a gift ban while governor. And his lack of media interviews has led to a familiar retort by Gardner. GARDNER: John Hickenlooper won't leave the basement. ACUNA: Hickenlooper's communications director said in an e-mail to FOX News \"the hiding claim is absolutely false,\" but declined to make him available. FRANK: For Hickenlooper, what you see is he's campaigning in a bubble of sorts. ACUNA: Democrats are hoping Gardner's relationship with the president will spell doom. TED TRIMPA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Cory has a new election fashion accessory, and that's an ankle bracelet that's called Trump. ACUNA: Hillary Clinton beat Trump here in 2016, but Gardner believes his ticket will outperform expectations when you consider the last three presidential elections. GARDNER: Donald Trump did better than Mitt Romney or John McCain. And so that's why I think Colorado continues to be that independent state that it has always been. (END VIDEOTAPE) ACUNA: Colorado mails every registered vote a ballot, a process that's been questioned nationally. This state has done it securely for multiple cycles so it's considered a nonissue. Bret? BAIER: Alicia, thank you. When we return, the panel on the president's news conference, reaction to the Woodward book, what we heard from the media managers from both campaigns -- that was something -- next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't lie. What I said is we have to be calm. We can't be panicked. I put the ban on China. So obviously outwardly I said it's a very serious problem. And it's always a serious problem. That doesn't mean I'm going to jump up and down in the air and start saying people are going to die, people are going to die. No. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's disgusting. And that's why we have no confidence in his leadership. He waved a white flag. He walked away. He didn't do a damn thing. Think about it. Think about what he did not do. And it's almost criminal. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I didn't really see any discrepancies between what he told us and what we told him and what he ultimately came out publicly and said. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All of this, the fallout from the Bob Woodward book, what the president said today at his news conference. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson, political editor at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Townhall.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=XCQJakhtxd6-cDoS2NqJbGtUX6PD-JcJ1DtfqKMtMR4&s=iHNpjGne0mvEU-5CA7QtxPVJLruqh3q6C-MWYj-aaok&e= , host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio. Julie, it's obviously interesting to hear both sides talk about it. We know what we know as far as what was said on those tapes to Bob Woodward and what was said publicly. The president is saying now that that was about not instilling panic in the country. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think one of the things that undercuts the president's argument when he talks about wanting to be a calming figure is that there's very little evidence over the last few years that Trump has wanted to be a calming figure. If you even look at where he wants to push this campaign, talking about law and order, talking about crime, he's actually trying to instill fear. He's actually trying to make people scared. And so it runs counter to a lot of what we've just seen from him publicly over the last couple of years. I do think more broadly the president does not want to be talking about the pandemic during the next eight weeks. He wants to be talking about that as though it's something in the past. The Biden campaign would really like to fight out this campaign squarely on this question of do you believe that president handled this in the right way or not, and they believe that the Woodward book has given them an opening to push that conversation and that campaign line forward. BAIER: Clearly that's their goal, the Biden campaign. Not to relive this, but here's the two campaigns from earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) T.J. DUCKLO, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: The vice president was not against the travel ban, first of all. Second of all, let's remember -- BAIER: He wasn't? DUCKLO: Bret, let's remember an important distinction. Donald Trump was the president of the United States. It was on Donald Trump -- BAIER: I'm asking you if Joe Biden was the president of the United States, if he was -- DUCKLO: It was on Donald Trump to take action to actually protect the American people. BAIER: And he closed the travel to China. DUCKLO: Joe Biden wrote an op-ed in \"USA Today\" in January warning that the threat was coming. TIM MURTAUGH: The things that are contained in there are the same things that president was saying publicly. He views it as part of his job of president of the United States -- BAIER: That's not true. It's not true. MURTAUGH: Yes, it is. BAIER: When was saying publicly that the virus would go from 15 to zero and that it was magically going to wash away, that is not the same thing he's telling Bob Woodward, that it's a deadly virus that travels over the air -- (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: I was trying to get answers, Charlie. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, indeed, you were. I actually think that the president actually doesn't mind talking about the pandemic because basically I think the election, voters are going to have two takeaways regarding the pandemic going into the election. The first is who did what, when. And I think that the president has a very good argument here for saying that he did a lot of the things right. Obviously, no response is going to be perfect. It's a pandemic. It is sort of amusing in Washington to watch people attack the president for not being presidential, and then when he tries to act presidential and try to calm people down and not create hysterics, he then gets killed for that. I do understand why the president doesn't walk out and say oh, my gosh, we have got a pandemic. Everything is on fire. The second thing -- and then, of course, don't forget, at that time what was going on in Congress was you had Democrats shutting down an entire branch of the federal government to pursue impeachment of the president even though they knew it wasn't going to go anywhere. And I think that is actually a pretty good argument the president can make going into the election. The second thing is, where do we go from here. And you have Vice President Biden talking about having a federal mandate requiring facemasks and wanting to shut down the economy again and hand everything over to scientists. That's one option. And then you have the president's option, which is something very different. And voters will decide. BAIER: I think it's important to get the timeline right at the beginning if you're going full bore criticizing. Guy, I want to talk about that vote today in the Senate. The Senate, the Republicans call a targeted bill, Democrats call a skinny basketball. Either way it went down to a filibuster that many Democrats actually oppose, the filibuster. But it went down to a filibuster, Democrats blocking it. How does that play politically now that this bill, it seems like there's not a negotiation happening? GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR: Yes, first of all, Bret, to one of your earlier interview, I want to assure that I'm not reading from a teleprompter during this interview. I can't answer that question if you were to ask it to me directly. To your question here about the filibuster, I think it is rich, as you point out, Democrats in the Senate are openly discussing getting rid of the filibuster should they win back power. Barack Obama, who was an enthusiastic participant in filibusters as a senator, now has called it a remnant of Jim Crow. But I guess it's a good remnant for now because the Democrats are using it to thwart Republicans. I think the Democrats have made a calculation here, which is the media by and large is on their side. They want Donald Trump to lose. And any outrageous behavior or indefensible behavior from the Democratic Party will be barely covered or swept under the rug. This was every single Senate Democrat announcing to the country, if people are paying attention, they refuse to even get onto a bill, which means they wouldn't even debate or amend a bill on coronavirus relief. That doesn't mean they have to vote for or against it. They even have another chance to block it down the line. This was just a full-blown piece of obstruction to not even discuss this very important issue. And Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer came out and declared victory and sort of high-fiving over this failure. I think there are a lot of hurting Americans that might not be thrilled with that. BAIER: The Democrats' argument right now is that it's not big enough. But $300 billion isn't zero. Panel, thank you. When we come back, a whole new meaning to garbage time. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally, tonight, reasons to celebrate. Most people really dread taking out the trash on garbage pickup day, but one little boy loves it so much in Tampa. Marlon admires garbage trucks that his local truck operator arranged a drive-by parade of garbage trucks for his fourth birthday. Marlon even got to sit in one of the trucks and honk the horn on his special day. Good for you. After spending nearly six months in the intensive care unit fighting the coronavirus, Rabbi Yehuda Dukes was released into rehab. Dukes spent four long months on a ventilator at NYU hospital, never stopped fighting. Cheering staff greeted him as he left ICU. Congratulations.

            "article_content": " How long can this nation survive when its main cultural and educational institutions preach a relentless, unchallenged stream of anti-Americanism to young people (and others) who lack the background to resist this toxicity? Along with others, I have long argued that the American left has a major problem with America as founded. Yet Democrats are outraged by the suggestion, and too many Republicans seem insufficiently concerned about it. They better wake up. DEROY MURDOCK: SUPPORT FOR BUBBA WALLACE SHOWS WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION TO RACISM \u2013 DESPITE LEFT'S CLAIMS If current events aren't enough to turn your head, please consider the following data presented by Eric Kaufmann, professor of politics at the University of London Birkbeck College. Kaufmann writes that the \"cultural revolutionaries\" who are toppling statues and renaming buildings \"are changing minds, and could be in a position to enact a root-and-branch reconstruction of America into something completely unrecognizable to its present-day inhabitants.\" He adds: \"Imagine a country whose collective memory has been upended, with a new constitution, anthem, and flag, its name changed from the sinful 'America' to something less tainted. Far-fetched? Not according to data I have collected on what liberal white Americans actually believe.\" Notice Kaufmann isn't talking merely about the extreme left but American liberals. This is chilling stuff but unsurprising to me. In my book \"Guilty by Reason of Insanity,\" I warned that socialism is not the only terrible idea the left is promoting. I wrote: \"The left isn't turning to socialism just because its members think it's more equitable than capitalism but also because they seek revenge against America's founding generation and its successor beneficiaries. They want to eradicate the Western tradition that spawned our unique American culture because it allegedly led to continental larceny against Native Americans, is in irredeemable moral debt over slavery, and is forever culpable for oppressing minorities and women through white privilege and the inherent exploitation of capitalism.\" I don't claim to be a prophet, but is my statement not vindicated by America's present turmoil? Kaufmann polled American liberals to gauge their willingness \"to jettison the country's cultural identity.\" On May 7 (before the George Floyd killing), he surveyed a sample of 870 Americans who \"lean young, liberal, and white.\" The group was not representative of the American population at large but drawn from the Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic survey platforms used by thousands of academics. He consciously removed conservatives and centrists to focus only on self-described liberals. He presented them with 16 \"outlandish\" statements and was \"amazed\" by their answers. He surveyed them again on June 15, after the Floyd killing and subsequent protests, and found that things \"had gotten even crazier.\" He asked them to agree or disagree that Americans should: \"1. Rebalance the history taught in schools until its voices and subjects reflect the demographics of the population and heritage of Native people and citizens of color \"2. Move, after public consultation, to a new American anthem that better reflects our diversity as a people \"3. Rename our cities and towns until they match the demographics of the population \"4. Rebalance the art shown in museums across the country until an analysis of content shows that it reflects the demography of the population and perspective of Native people and citizens of color \"5. Move, after an open public process, to a new name for our country that better reflects the contributions of Native Americans and our diversity as a people \"6. Rename our states until they better reflect the heritage of Native people and citizens of color \"7. Gradually replace many older public buildings with new structures that don't perpetuate a Eurocentric order, until a more representative public space is achieved \"8. Respectfully remove the monument to four white male presidents at Mount Rushmore, as they presided over the conquest of Native people and repression of women and minorities \"9. Allow our public parks to return to their natural state, before a European sense of order was imposed upon them \"10. Move, after public consultation, to a new American flag that better reflects our diversity as a people \"11. Consider adopting a new national language, that will be forged from the immigrant and Native linguistic diversity of this country's past. \"12. Remove existing statues of white men from public spaces until the stock of statues matches the demographics of the population \"13. Gently remodel the statue of liberty to make it better reflect the diversity of America \"14. Rename our streets and neighbourhoods until they match the demographics of the population \"15. Move, after public consultation, to a new American constitution that better reflects our diversity as a people \"16. Begin changing the layout of our cities, towns, and highways, moving away from the grid system to follow the more natural trails originally used by Native people.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Kaufmann reports: \"Every one of these proposals represents a radical blow to American cultural nationhood. Yet ... six of them carry the support of more than 50 percent of committed liberals ... Eight are backed by a majority of the 40 percent of liberals who identify as 'very liberal.' Some 80 percent of those who have made up their mind would replace the national anthem and constitution.\" Assuming this survey is remotely scientific and representative of liberal thinking, it should be uncontroversial to say the American left wants to radically transform America. CLICK\u00a0HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After considering this data, and the left's support and sympathy for the violence, looting and anarchy sweeping this country, could it be any clearer what is at stake in the 2020 elections? I respectfully appeal to reasonable people on both sides of the political aisle to recognize what's happening to the greatest nation in history and oppose it before it's too late. These kinds of revolutions don't end well for anyone -- including the nihilists who engineer them. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID LIMBAUGH",

A former national surrogate for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ripped into white congressional Democrats on Monday after they wore African-patterned garb and knelt in a demonstration against racism and police brutality. \"I still can\u2019t wrap my mind around the fact that they draped these white people in kente cloth to 'honor'\u00a0him. This has to be hell,\" author Frederick Joseph tweeted, also arguing that black Americans are \"being pandered to, and ultimately, disrespected.\" In a tweet thread, he argued that Democrats were failing in their attempts to be helpful amid ongoing strife surrounding George Floyd's death. DEMS UNVEIL SWEEPING POLICE REFORM AIMED AT HOLDING COPS ACCOUNTABLE He specifically took aim at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who joined other Democrats in kneeling inside of\u00a0the Capitol Visitor Center on Thursday. Democratic members of both the House and Senate knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds to honor Floyd, representing the amount of time he was pinned down by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. TOP MINNEAPOLIS POL DUCKS QUESTION ON HOW 'DISMANTLE' POLICE WOULD AFFECT CRIME VICTIMS, CITES 'PRIVILEGE' The kneeling also touched on an ongoing protest trend harkening back to former NFL player Colin Kaepernick and demonstrations during the national anthem. Pelosi said on Monday that members of Congress would be kneeling in a place where they typically recited the Pledge of Allegiance. \"This is a mess,\" Joseph said in one tweet. In another, he added: \"If anyone can\u2019t understand why Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and them dressed up like they\u2019re trying to sneak into Wakanda is disrespectful and appropriative you have a great deal to learn.\" Wakanda is the fictional land in Africa associated with the Marvel superhero Black Panther. He went on to suggest that House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., and the Congressional Black Caucus were wrong if they were the ones who suggested this demonstration. \"Also, if the CBC and/or Clyburn suggested this, it\u2019s a testament to how problematic some Black people are in politics. Gross,\" he said. Democrats\u00a0unveiled sweeping new legislation Monday that, if passed, aims to\u00a0increase accountability of police officers by banning certain practices and significantly curbing immunity from legal consequences stemming from acts committed in the line of duty.

            "article_content": "Ari Fleischer blasts CNN for its friendly setting for a Biden town hall and explains how mail-in voting can lead to 'chaos' Politico chief political correspondent Tim Alberta offered Joe Biden praise for remarks he made at a town hall on Thursday, which were apparently completely false. After being asked if Biden benefited from \"White privilege,\" Biden pivoted to\u00a0his \"Scranton roots,\" highlighting\u00a0his non-Ivy League education as a commonality with ordinary Americans. \"Guys like me, the first in the family to go to college,\" Biden said. \"My dad busted his neck and came up here, worked here... We are as good as anybody else, and guys like Trump, who inherited everything and squandered what they inherited, are the people I've always had a problem with.\" MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE RIPS BIDEN'S 'SCRANTON VS. PARK AVENUE'\u00a0MESSAGE: 'HE DOESN'T WANT MY VOTE?' Alberta showered the Democratic candidate with high marks, suggesting \"This might be the single-most effective line deployed against Trump since he rode down the escalator.\" However, Biden's \"single-most effective line\" was actually a\u00a0falsehood. The Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway fact-checked Biden, pulling up a quote the candidate made to The New York Times back in 1987 admitting that he wasn't, in fact, the first in his family to go to college, telling the paper \"there are Finnegans, my mother\u2019s family, that went to college\" in addition to his great-grandfather. CNN PANNED FOR 'SOFTBALL' BIDEN TOWN HALL: THIS ISN'T GETTING HIM READY FOR THE DEBATES Moreover, the claim was actually one of the several examples of plagiarism that derailed Biden's first presidential run. His \"first in the family\" remarks originated from speeches made by\u00a0British Labour politician Neil Kinnock. Even Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler praised Hemingway's reporting, acknowledging he overlooked Biden's falsehood from the town hall. Critics piled on Alberta's praise for the former VP, which remained on Twitter for at least 19 hours. \"Why haven't you deleted this? Joe Biden was not the first person in his family to go to college. It is a lie, and a plagiarized lie at that,\" Washington Examiner reporter Jerry Dunleavy told Alberta. \"It's a lie,\"\u00a0Media Research Center vice president\u00a0Dan Gainor tweeted. POLITICO HAMMERED FOR TWEET SAYING ALICE JOHNSON HAS BEEN 'PROPPED UP' BY TRUMP CAMPAIGN \"'Effective line;\u00a0that is false,\" Fourth Watch media critic Steve Krakauer said.\u00a0\"Also, interesting that the media coverage of this quote is avoiding the context, which was a question about 'White privilege,'\u00a0which he briefly nodded to before pivoting to essentially claiming he has no privilege because he\u2019s from Scranton.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "article_content": "'Ingraham Angle' host contrasts president's love of country with Joe Biden's 'shallow' promises Oct. 23, 2020 \u2013 This is a rush transcript from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d October 23, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from Washington tonight. The media, they are desperately trying to shield Joe Biden from any coverage of his son's scandal, his family's scandal, and of course conceal whatever Joe knew and when he knew it. Well, we on the \"Ingraham Angle\" will not let this story get buried. So we went straight to swing state voters to find out what they think. Plus, it went to Ohio State University, where I spoke with students who are begging, begging for things to return to normal. And Republican-state lawmaker tells us what he's doing to give people hope of getting their old lives back. And that is a state where interesting things could happen on November 3. Also Raymond Arroyo breaks down Biden's biggest tales from last night's debate. And he is going to reveal which candidate the moderator interrupted the most. I can't miss Friday follies in moments. But first, the final stretch, that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Biden has his big donors, he has his political consultants, of course he has his Hollywood celebrities and his Silicon Valley billionaires, but we all know that the man himself inspires zero excitement among the voters. For Democrats, he is just the un-Trumpion necessity of the moment. Now by contrast, millions of Americans, they would walk across glass to vote for Donald Trump. They will line up by the hundreds of thousands this week when you add it all up at his rallies across the Midwest, the Sun Belt, and in states like Pennsylvania. Well, and for good reason, right? His \"America First\" agenda, it helped raise median wages by about $6,000. He kept us out of stupid wars, he took on China, he strengthened our border, and although the media won't admit it, he handled the pandemic better than Europe. Oh, a lots happening in Naples, Italy tonight. Check it out. Oh, and another reason, voting for Biden would mean, you would be aligning yourself with some of the most condescending snobs on the face of the planet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON MEACHAM, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, NEWSWEEK: I think Trump did himself good with his base tonight. The question for America is how big that base is? There is a lizard brain in this country. Donald Trump is a product of the white man's - the anguish, nervous white guy's lizard brain. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: In 2008, you were clinging to your guns and religion; 2016, you were the deplorables, the irredeemables; and in 2020, a wanted historian says, \"You're just a bunch of racist lizard brains\". Lizard brains is the quote, racist is obviously implied. And of course Biden agrees, don't fall for the whole homespun, \"I'm from Scranton and I rode Amtrak\" nonsense. He's just a hologram for the real power base. His real power base, who is it, wants the donors. And they had no use for people in flyover country? Well, unless they speak mandarin, maybe. Biden's puppet masters, they know that their candidate can't be beat Trump's economic record, and they don't even pretend otherwise. And they know they can't compete with Trump's record for African-Americans or Hispanics, so instead they throw down their worn-out racism card. And they repeat that Trump's Charlottesville, good people on both sides lie, then they pivot to the gassing of protestors and Lafayette Park lie and so on and so forth. And their media poodles recklessly regurgitated it all day in and day out with these pained expressions on their face. They never smile. Now in essence, the Democrats uplifting argument for Biden comes down to this, hey lizard brains, check your white privilege and vote for Joe. And if you don't, you're going to be branded a racist. If you put a Trump sign on your yard, you are going to be targeted. If you go to a Trump rally, you might as well wear a white hood. These insinuations, these attacks, they are beyond cynical. It's not just hardball politics, these are flat out lies. It's actually evil. The forces propping up Biden do want you to know the truth, and they will spend billions to prevent you from getting the truth. But it's not just that, like this man, Duke Tanner, just pardoned by President Trump, who was serving a 20-year sentence for a nonviolent offense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DUKE TANNER, FORMER BOXER: President Trump, I just want to thank you for giving me a second chance and believing in me and reading my petition. I'm just so thankful. It was just 20 years ago, I fought at the Trump casino, and now you sign to give me clemency. First I didn't know it was real, until I was (inaudible) touch this little guy right here. I left when he was two years old, President Trump, you reunited me back to my family. I lost my mother and my father, but I've got him, and this is what I live for. Thank you, President Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I cried when I watched that entire video. Watch it if you can. Go online and see it. Who among us hasn't needed a second chance in life? Biden and Obama had eight years to get something done on criminal justice reform and give a lot of people second chances, and they didn't. And yet, Joe claims that he has the patent on the decency vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: What is on the ballot here is the character of this country, decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I'm going to make sure you get that, you haven't been getting in the last four years. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It's just so shallow. You got to be your own news consumer. But he is right to this extent, it is on the ballot. Decency is on the ballot. And it's another argument for Trump's reelection. President Trump loves this country and he has made enormous personal sacrifices to serve the country. And from the beginning, even before he was inaugurated, his entire family came under a sustained assault from a failed establishment from both sides of the aisle that loathes him. Now others might have given up, or just soured on politics, gone back to New York, had a good life, maybe thrown in the towel, but not him. Through it all, he has continued to celebrate the United States and its history. He has defended our monuments and our cities. He's put conservative talented men and women on the federal bench, including soon-to-be associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court. And anyone who claims to be pro- life and yet isn't supporting him is a complete and total phony. He has done more to promote the pro-life cause than any president in U.S. history. Now compare that to Vice President Biden, who stands with the callous butchers who profit off abortion on demand. Biden supporters include many who despise this country, who believe that our whole history from beginning to end is nothing more than a sorry saga of racism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: There is institutional racism in America. And we have always said, we've never lived up to it, that we hold this truth to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. But guess what, we have never ever lived up. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That was the unbelievable thing ever. Nothing we've done has even taken a step toward redeeming the sin of slavery, nothing. Even the election of Barack Obama, I guess that didn't count either. His administration would teach our young people to hate this country, to tear down its history, to spoil our cities, and terrorize our people. Meanwhile Biden's family, they have made a fortune out of what is supposed to be public service. If you love America, if you think our experiment in democracy is one of the greatest triumphs of the human spirit and you reject this pay-to-play government symbolized by Biden, you must stand with President Trump, for all of us who love America and who fought as hard as we could for the middle class. This is our time. This is our chance. Because never before in my lifetime have the elites gathered in such numbers, were spent such money to stop a political movement. They used to mock us, but now they fear us, and they are right. They had their chance to govern this country for decades and they blew it. So let them spend their billions on propaganda, let them spread their lies, let them quiver with threats and rage. We will defy them. In the final week of the campaign, President Trump is doing his part. He's doing everything possible to get a message, a strong message, past a hostile media. We have to help him spread that message. Talk to friends, talk to your parents, talk to your kids, talk to people at work, at church, at your kid's schools. On Election Day, let's teach the elites and their lackeys, a message they will never forget. In America, power belongs to the people, all of the people. Not just an elite few who write the checks every four years. And that's the \"Angle\". Now yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation, which means it will likely be up for a floor vote on Monday. But today, Chuck Schumer, throughout procedural hurdles, threw a hissy fit, including demanding a closed-door session in calling a vote to indefinitely postpone Barrett's confirmation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The Senate Republican majority is conducting the most rushed, most partisan and least legitimate process in the entire history of Supreme Court nominations, and Democrats will not lend an ounce of legitimacy to the process. We should shut off the cameras, close the Senate, and talk face-to-face about what this might mean for the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, they don't the cameras in there. Suddenly no cameras, that's when they are really up to no good. Senator Lindsey Graham, Senate Judiciary Committee chair joins me now. Senator Graham, good to see you tonight. Now, he is acting - this is like a -- SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you. INGRAHAM: This is like a teenager throwing a temper tantrum because he can't take the car out at night and hit the town. What is the bad temper tantrum today? GRAHAM: Well, being lectured by Chuck Schumer about how to treat judges is like an arsonist complaining about the fire department. Chuck Schumer is the guy that changed the rules in 2013, so they could stack the circuit and district courts. Chuck Schumer is the guy that declared war on Kavanaugh. Chuck Schumer has done everything he could to politicize the court. And I told Schumer when he called me in 2013, you will regret changing the rules. Come Monday, we're going to put Judge Barrett on the court and Senator Schumer is going to regret it. Without Senator Schumer and Senator Reid, there would be no Judge Amy Barrett. So, payback is hell. INGRAHAM: Well, last night, we did a pretty interesting focus group, senator, in Columbus, Ohio. We had people who were Biden supporters, a couple of independents, and Trump supporters. And we asked them about this Judiciary Committee stunt by the Democrats. Watch the reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Defensive and an abdication of duty, hands up. OK, all the three, you didn't think it was an abdication of duty. You studied under Amy Coney Barrett, Alex. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did. But as to the actual prompting question, I think it was just a hollow political maneuver. I'm not giving them any credit for it. I just think it was nonsense. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Senator, nonsense is a nice way of putting it, but people are pretty smart. They see through the desperation. GRAHAM: Well, so number one, is disrespect to Judge Barrett. She has lived a life worthy being on the court. You know very well. She is one of the most talented people I've ever met in my life. Her knowledge of the law is wide and deep, her judicial disposition should be the gold standard for every future nominee. And as a person, she has lived an incredibly well- rounded life. She embraces her faith without apology, she's pro-life, but she's going to apply a lot of the facts not the law of Amy. By not showing up and giving her the courtesy of a vote says more about the Democrats than it says Judge Barrett. My opponents raised $109 million against me. He said the reason he got in this race is because the way I behaved in Kavanaugh. The reason I'm going to win South Carolina is because I stood up for Kavanaugh. They are trying to destroy the Trump presidency. They are trying to wipe us out financially. So, if you are out there and you want to do something to help the Republicans, go to my website LindseyGraham.com, have my back, I've got Amy's back. I need your help to finish this race, all of our Republicans do. They're trying to wipe us out with money, but South Carolina is not for sale. The president did a hell of a job last night. So, Laura, people - they should listen to your monologue. This country is worth fighting for, Judge Barrett is worth fighting for. I'm in the fight, I'm up here, I'm not leaving until she gets on the bench. Help me if you can by going to my website. INGRAHAM: Senator Graham, the fact that you are fighting for your Senate seat this year, to some people it's a cause for great concern for the Republican Party. On the other hand, it's a sign I think that the Trump agenda has been wildly successful against the billionaire class that wants to outsource more jobs to China, like the old days under Biden. And they want to go back to that, and I don't think South Carolinians want to go back to those days. Do they, senator? GRAHAM: No, ma'am, this is the most successful presidency for conservatives since Ronald Reagan. 250 judges on the district and circuit courts, three Supreme Court justices, constitutional conservatives, the strongest military since Ronald Reagan, order at the border versus chaos. Who wants to go back to the good old days of being overrun with caravans? You know what's on the ballot, conservative judges versus liberal judges, tax cuts versus tax increases, open borders versus secure borders, to the American people that the difference between these two candidates in terms of where they take the country is stark. It's real and they are trying to beat us because they are afraid of four more years of Donald Trump. Four years of picking conservative judges, four more years of controlling the tax cut. INGRAHAM: Well, they are being exposed. I think they don't like to be exposed and we now see who China is rooting for in this election. They are not rooting for Donald Trump. They want Biden back in the White House, because that was a good run for them. Biden-Obama that was a great eight years for China, not so, not so. If Trump has four more years, it's going to be brutal for China. GRAHAM: Trump is the first guy in the last 30 years to take on China. He is pushing back it's against they are cheating Iran, the Ayatollah. Donald Trump has been the Ayatollah's worst nightmare. Trump got out of the Iran nuclear agreement which was the worst deals since Munich. He has reset the Mideast. Look at all of the piece deals now between Arab countries and Israel, because Trump stood up to Iran, who is a threat to the Arabs and the Israelis. This is been a consequential presidency. Let's keep it going, folks. Four more years of this and we will change the world, just not America. Help me, I'm fighting, we are all fighting. Help this president, help President Trump, help me. INGRAHAM: Senator, this has been - they want Trump to be a speed bump on the way to socialism, and it's as simple as that. The blip in the road, a pothole - but they want to roll right back over the American worker. And I know the good people of South Carolina. When they saw Nancy Pelosi today talking about energy jobs and phasing out of the fossil fuel industry - can we play that, guys? I want to play that really quickly. Because I think the American people need to see this. Joe Biden said, he's going to phase out oil and gas, ok. That's what he's going to do, fossil fuels gone in a number of years. This is what Pelosi's response to that was. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It is a health issue, a public health issue, it is an issue of jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs. This is god's creation and that we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. We don't want any more government than we need, but we can't have any less than to keep the American people healthy, preserve our planet. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: No more government than we need? Senator, really quick. Close it out. GRAHAM: The Mideast is cheering Nancy Pelosi. If we destroy the oil and gas industry in America, the biggest winner is Mideast oil producers. We have become - we lose our energy independence -- INGRAHAM: Millions of jobs. (CROSSTALK)  GRAHAM: So millions of jobs and the bad guys dominate the oil and gas market. Trump got to stay energy independence, don't let the Democrats take it away. INGRAHAM: Senator, thank you so much and best of luck on November 3. Lindsey Graham for South Carolina. And coming up more from our focus group in Columbus, Ohio, last night. Their thoughts on the importance of the Hunter Biden scandal, plus who they think really won the debate. Don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Raymond Arroyo and I are here in Columbus, Ohio, to get instant debate reaction from swing state voters following the following presidential debate. And as you saw last night, well, we at the angle brought together this amazing focus group of both Trump and Biden supporters for their reaction. Now there are few things that we didn't get to last night that we wanted to circle back to. And I want to start with what President Trump said about the emails found on the Hunter Biden laptop. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- dollars from China. BIDEN: Not true. TRUMP: -- after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now did that change anyone's mind about Joe Biden? That question, raise your hand. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. INGRAHAM: That exchange? AL EDMONDSON, BIDEN VOTER: No, not at all. The emails are not that important to me. I do think that you have to look for more substance and the substance wasn't good enough for me. ARROYO: Kevin, you had a huge reaction to this when it happened live. What did you make of this moment? KEVIN POPHAM, TRUMP VOTER: I think where there is smoke, there's fire. And I hope, I hope that the truth comes out, one way or another. I just don't think we've had enough time but I think there's something there because we have got some smoke. ARROYO: Go ahead, Alex. ALEX EHLER, TRUMP VOTER: I'll say equally concerning with that exchange and also in relation to the Hunter Biden emails, the response to the story that we saw last week as well has turned me more away from Biden as a see a collection of interests in tech and elsewhere that saw to suppress \"The New York Post\" story on Twitter, how the \"The New York Post\" is still locked out of its Twitter account. And I think the op-ed editor of the \"The New York Post\" has been on this network a few times discussing that. And that really has pushed me in a certain direction. INGRAHAM: Well, to add, the point that I think a lot of people were raising last night as this was going on is, Joe Biden keeps saying, this is part of the Russian disinformation. But Trump said, and you can all react to this, he said, \"Well, wait a second, are you saying the laptop was created by Russia?\" and so he did the Russia, Russia, Russia thing. Was that effective? DEB LUDWIG, TRUMP VOTER: That didn't affect me, but what bothers me is, we've become - our news has become so personalized that if you are a Biden supporter, you are not getting that part of the story. And if you are Trump supporter, you are. So the Trump supporters are going to continue to believe that this is a Joe Biden corruption piece. And the people who are Biden supporters are going to think that this is a bunch of Russian hooey. ARROYO: I want to go to my independent Sadie in the middle and then to Lauren. Go ahead. Your reaction. SADIE MOORE STEWART, BIDEN VOTER: The response of the media and the press is symbolic of what it takes to create the system that we are under. And the divisiveness is just advanced and supported, split, that's exactly what the system requires, that's what democracy requires under a two-party system and they did it very effectively. \"The New York Post\" played their role, and then the other side played their role. LAUREN ENGLER, BIDEN VOTER: This is actually, for Democrats, a non-issue, a non-story. It's not being covered like it is on Fox. And quite frankly, I'm kind of tired of it. I don't believe that it's a thing, and even if it is, it's like, it doesn't matter. It's not pertinent anymore to any of this. INGRAHAM: The Hunter Biden's former business partner, Tony Bobulinski, was speaking out. And this is what he said. Now this happened just before the debate, someone who both has spoken to, Vice President Biden and knew Hunter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TONY BOBULINSKI, CEO, SINOHAWK HOLDINGS: I've heard Joe Biden say that he has never discussed business with Hunter. That is false. I have first-hand knowledge about this, because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden. Hunter often referred to his father as the \"big guy\", or \"my chairman\". I have no wish to bury anyone, the few contributions I have made have been to Democrats. To protect my family name and my business reputation, I need to ensure that the true facts are out there. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Kevin. On this issue, is corruption in government, specifically the idea of a government official and his family getting rich off of ties to foreign businesses, especially our adversary, is that important, whether the president is a Republican or a Democrat? POPHAM: it absolutely is important on either side and she is right. It's not being covered, but the question is why. Why don't you see it on NBC, ABC or CBS? That's a question that we should be asking. ARROYO: Show of hands, did the Bobulinski presser, Hunter Biden's business partner coming forward and saying this, does this change at all your perception of this story? Mark? MARK ARNOLD, BIDEN VOTER: I don't know this gentleman. This was the first time I'm hearing this. And frankly, it's unsubstantiated until it's truly investigated. INGRAHAM: He is a Democrat, right, he was a Democrat. He is a Democrat and he donated and supported and has his whole life to Democrats. ARNOLD: He has. ARROYO: Yes, bobulinski has. And they have emails of their exchange, Hunter and Bobulinski's exchanges over the years. Lauren, you're not shaking your head. You are not buying this, no matter what? ENGLER: You told you are talking about possibly a president making money off of foreign deals, that's what President Trump is doing right now and he's in office. So I think it's like you're kind of comparing - if I do it, it's OK, but if Biden does it, it's not. It just doesn't flow. INGRAHAM: Taylor, I want to get to Taylor. Because Taylor hasn't spoken yet. Taylor, the media for some time now has said, more the left-wing media has said that Donald Trump, we thought he was some great businessman, but now we see his taxes and he is not such a great businessman, at least in recent years. But now the narrative has shifted and people that deflect this story say, \"Well, President Trump have made money off of foreign business\". Well, which is it? Is Trump losing money, or making money? TAYLOR ARMSTRONG, TRUMP VOTER: It's a great thing, it's contradicting to say that the president of the United States isn't a good businessman. He doesn't have any money, he doesn't have any funds to his name, but yet he is working in all these bilateral deals, I guess, in Moscow and the hotel and now have foreign bank account in China? You can't have it both ways. It's either he has a lot of money, or he doesn't have any money at all. So which one is it? And right now the American people are confused on, I'm sure, which way they are trying to talk. INGRAHAM: Are you first time voting for you? ARMSTRONG: First time presidential election, yes. INGRAHAM: And what draws you to President Trump? ARMSTRONG: The can-do attitude. It's let's get things done. Especially as a college kid looking for a job here in about a year, I want results. I want something that there so that when I graduate I can get a job, get things, make a living for myself, and I think the president has done a good job with that so far. RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: David in the back in small business owner, Laura. David, you're very concerned about outsourcing and offshoring of jobs. You have a business connected to manufacturing. Your reaction to what you heard the other night? And does this play at all, does this concern you at all that Hunter Biden may have been a conduit to enrich Joe Biden and the family was making -- DAVID WILSON, TRUMP VOTER: Absolutely. Also the lack of attention it is getting nationally, that's concerning, because you know if it was a Trump doing this, it would be blood in the water. ARROYO: Alex. ALEX EHLER, TRUMP VOTER: And I think building on that as well, what's equally disturbing is I think just this morning National Public Radio said that this story was a distraction and it wouldn't dedicate any time for it. INGRAHAM: So this is the reason NPR gave for not covering the Hunter Biden story, saying \"We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don't want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just pure distractions.\" So how many people out there think a media outlet, again, regardless of who is in the White House, should regard stories about our adversaries funneling money to family members of a sitting president that's not a story, how many of you think that's the way media should react? ARROYO: Nobody. Nobody. Final question I want to ask, very quickly. Who won the debate last night do you think? Show of hands, Biden. One, two. Donald Trump? OK, a majority thought Donald Trump won. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Up ahead, Raymond Arroyo reveals Biden's debate tells and ticks. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's Friday, and that means it's time for \"Friday Follies.\" For that we're joined by FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo, author of the new book, \"The Spider who Saved Christmas.\" Raymond, there were plenty of moments in the final presidential debate that went uncovered up but not unnoticed. And I think they can affect the way the voters viewed the candidates. ARROYO: Laura, what do we always say? The optics, the unsaid things are how people perceive, and it shapes their perception of these candidates. Some people in our focus group thought that Biden was a little fuzzy, evasive in his answers. They came to that appraisal due to repeated instances where Biden used crutches, like \"in fact,\" or \"come on,\" when he ran out of gas. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're, this is -- don't worry. It's all going to be over soon. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, folks. The fact is that he's already cost the American people -- The fact is I've made it very clear. If in fact you had family came across, they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plans -- A whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Anyone who has, in fact, closely watched Biden, as we have Laura, will recognize that \"in fact\" filler, which he in fact employs when searching for the next thought. It was painfully obvious in this debate. And the longer it were on, the less coherence we had. It was kind of concerning. At many points, he just ran out of gas. INGRAHAM: Well, he has always -- going back to the 90s and 80s when I first saw him, he has always relied on these verbal crutches. And he thinks they somehow make him more accessible. I have never bought into that homespun thing. The more someone talks about how dignified they are, the less dignified they become in my eyes, OK. ARROYO: You don't like the stories of Pop and Corn Pop and riding in a car, you don't like all those homespun stories? INGRAHAM: It's all trying too hard. There was also moments in the debate where Trump bested Biden, who had no way to recovery. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you could do better. Joe got $3.5 million from Russia. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The crime bill had been in the law for a while. And one of these things we should be doing, there should be no minimum mandatories in the law. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You both have very different visions on climate change. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Was Joe looking -- is he waiting for the Amtrak, Laura? What was that? The two-minute limit actually helps Biden. I've said this before. And it helps him a lot because at 2:15 or 2:30, he starts to wander into incoherence, and some of that happened last night, particularly the later the hour got. INGRAHAM: Again, he tries to substitute real substance with these bromideal constructions, so it's cliches, you've got to pull yourself up from your bootstraps. It's that whole thing. That's fine as far as - ARROYO: We can do this. We can do this, Laura. We are America. INGRAHAM: Quick. We're running out of time. ARROYO: Meanwhile, Biden has a couple of events planned over the weekend, but as you mentioned earlier, he wandered 15 minutes from the house to campaign. But the campaign is sending Kamala Harris out to Cleveland and Michigan. But in between dancing, she has been making some Biden-esque gaffes of her own. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're looking at over 220 million American who just in the last several months died. Many -- it breaks your heart. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: In fact, it is 220,000 Americans who died of COVID. No you see why the team is sending Barack Obama to Florida this weekend, Laura. But his visit this week to Pennsylvania was not exactly standing room only. This is the -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You can have all the TV ads you want, you can have all the digital ads you want. But at the end of the day, people connect with people. And obviously, this is an extraordinary election because we are in the midst of a pandemic. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh, how did I miss that? ARROYO: Laura, it's rough out there. I talk to more people on my coffee run that Obama talked to the other day. This is sad to watch. INGRAHAM: When he said ads, ads don't win elections. That's they have, because Biden hasn't been campaigning. What are they talking about? ARROYO: He's been at home. He's been at home. INGRAHAM: They are swamping Trump in ads. They are swamping the Trump campaign in ads in the Midwest because they have billionaires supporting their campaign who want to outsource jobs to China. That's how this campaign is being funded. So for Obama to go up there in his shirt sleeves and start trying to do that whole thing he does is a joke. Raymond, I don't mean to step on your \"Friday Follies\" but that was too much for me. All right, Raymond, awesome. Still ahead, all across the Midwest, Americans are begging for a return to normalcy. We went to Ohio State. I'll tell the tale when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: While we are in Columbus, I stopped by Ohio State University, of course home of the Buckeyes, to see how students were coping with life under these ridiculous COVID restrictions. Here's what they told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Super great just knowing that I'm finally here on campus and I'm going to be able to see the Buckeyes. I feel like I'm definitely safe on campus. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sucks trying to go through all this knowing that I feel like we should all be in class learning with our friends. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that we need to learn how to live with that, but not just shut down the entire world. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A whole lot of students are suffering academically because they are at home in virtual classrooms. And the ones who are here can't get the right education just because of all of the restrictions. It's hard to have labs and things like that. So shutting down the country will be very detrimental to academics as well as the economy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel like people are starting to wake up to that, and realize that there is always going to be fear in life. There's always going to be obstacles in our way, and we have to be able to overcome those things and learn how to deal with things. Just last year, as I heard you say earlier, it was a pretty bad flu season, and we didn't lock down the country for that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's very hard to learn online and to teach yourself some subjects. I'm personally ready to go back to the in-person classroom. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are isolated and we are alone. And as many Zoom meetings as there are created, I know that I'm not feeling like I'm connecting with anybody personally. And that's really hard. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It's not only college students who crave normalcy. Republicans in Minnesota are running on a platform to loosen these COVID restrictions if voters give them control of the state legislature. They're calling it a contract to open Minnesota. Here to tell us what that entails is Minnesota House Minority Leader, Kurt Daudt. Representative Daudt, what does this platform look like in practice? And I know Minnesota pretty well, I spend a lot of time there. I can guess this answer, but how are the voters responding to open up campaign? KURT DAUDT (R), MINNESOTA HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: First, thanks for having me on, Laura. And you are right, the same thing we're hearing, that you heard in Ohio we are hearing here in Minnesota. Parents want their kids in school. We have the highest achievement gap in the country here in Minnesota, which means our low income and minority students aren't getting the same level of education as their peers. And we think that's shameful. Unfortunately, our governor has a policy in place right now that will have a default where most kids will be in a distanced learning situation. And we are hearing from parents via email and text message and calls constantly that their kids who are normally straight A students are suffering and falling behind in the classroom. So we have a very simple statement that we just believe that every Minnesota student has a right to be in the classroom. And that should be the default. And if there is some reason, maybe there's an infection and they need to quarantine, then they can participate via distant learning. But we feel that every Minnesota student has a right to be in a classroom. INGRAHAM: Kurt, this was a big topic of the debate last night, of course. President Trump has always wanted schools to open. Europe, of course, has had almost all their schools open during the entire pandemic, Sweden and so forth, seeing that kids don't really get the virus, or if they do, it's very mild. And it's not even clear they transmit the virus as readily as adults. But that having been said, Joe Biden has been coming out there strong, saying we have got to listen to the science, and this is part of what he said last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I'm not shutting down today, but look, they need standards. The standard is if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up, more social distancing, do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And he went on to say that schools need money for new ventilation systems. Now, that's a pretty heavy cost, don't you think? I know what HVAC cost in a house. Every school in the United States needs HVAC replaced before they can go back to school, what? DAUDT: It demonstrates how Democrats really are trying to scare people. We should follow science, and the science is really clear. We have had kids in school now for a couple months, and the data is clear. There was a great article in \"The Atlantic\" recently that said that the infection rate among students is 0.013 percent, or about 1.3 infections per 1,000 students over a two-week period. That's almost nothing. And if you only have to quarantine and isolate the kids that came in contact with that 1.3 infection, we can successfully and safely open our schools and give the kids the education that they deserve to have. INGRAHAM: We also have other things happening in Minnesota, which is we have an unusually, or surprisingly, I should say, tight Senate race with Democrat incumbent Tina Smith being challenged in a dead heat according to the latest poll by Jason Lewis. That's right. DAUDT: Jason Lewis. INGRAHAM: And that's how bad it is, I didn't even know his name. It's a dead heat. What's happening? Is that possibly a good sign for Trump in Minnesota? DAUDT: It is. And Trump has been really visiting Minnesota a lot. We're hearing that he will probably come one more time. I know the vice president is coming up Monday to northern Minnesota up to the Iron Range. We think that Minnesota is absolutely in play. The president almost won it, a point- and-a-half from winning it four years go, and we think that it's absolutely in play. The Senate race is, we think that those numbers are accurate. We think that the Senate race is that close. Jason Lewis is a former congressman. The current senator, Tina Smith, is a former lieutenant governor appointed by our previous governor to fill Al Franken's seat. And she has probably the lowest name i.d. of any competitor would be my guess. INGRAHAM: She's a dud. No, she's a dud. DAUDT: People don't know who she is. INGRAHAM: She's a dud, nobody knows. DAUDT: She is absolutely vulnerable. INGRAHAM: And she did not lead during any of the violence and the destruction in Minneapolis. You never heard anything from her. So Minnesotans, you're nice, but now it's time to like -- no more Mr. Nice Guy. You've got to put out the fires, literally and figuratively. Representative Daudt, it's great to see you tonight, and I certainly hope you open up to Minnesota sooner rather than later. Thanks so much. DAUDT: Thank you so much, Laura. INGRAHAM: And up ahead, a response to Biden's dark winter warning. The Last Bite, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We are about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan. And there is no prospect that there is going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan. TRUMP: I don't think we are going to have a dark winter at all. We are opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease which we didn't at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: One hundred percent he's right. Remember, Biden sent that tweet out about xenophobia. Trump is an optimist, and he trusts the people. Biden, the pessimist, thinks that government, not you, knows best. Once again, I'm always struck by how gloomy and dark the Democrat outlook has become. Months ago, \"The Angle\" told you that the Democrats were waging a war against freedom and a war against fun. For Biden it's always nighttime in America, where you have to work harder for less, sacrifice more in order to fund their radical destructive plans. But for Trump, like Reagan, it's always morning in America, because we believe we're heaven blessed with liberty, faith, and family. And just remember, as President Reagan said, freedom is never more than one generation away from extension. Let's not lose it on our watch. That's all the time we have tonight.

A prominent Christian pastor and author tearfully apologized this week for liking posts on social media by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk\u00a0which were considered racially insensitive. Pastor Chris Hodges, founder of the 60,000-member Church of the Highlands in Alabama, which\u00a0has\u00a0one of the largest congregations\u00a0in the nation, tripled\u00a0down on his public apology Tuesday. DC BISHOP UNDER FIRE FOR \u2018PARTISAN ATTACK\u2019 OF TRUMP\u2019S VISIT TO CATHOLIC SHRINE \"Some saw something on social media that questioned my character, and, I\u2019ll own it, by the way, but that is not what I believe, and it is not what we teach. And I understand how this has made you feel and I apologize,\" Hodges said Sunday morning. Chris Hodges, senior pastor and founder of 60,000-member Church of the Highlands in Alabama, apologized multiple times for liking social media posts by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk that a high school teacher called racially insensitive.\u00a0 (Church of the Highlands) Addressing George Floyd's death while under police custody on Memorial Day, and the ensuing racial unrest, during a Saturday morning prayer service, Hodges explained:\u00a0\"Racism, bigotry, prejudice exists. It's real and it's of the devil. White supremacy or any supremacy other than Christ is of the devil.\" The apology came after a Birmingham high school English teacher told a local newspaper she found it objectionable the pastor was following Kirk on social media. POLICE OFFICER PRAYS WITH PROTESTER IN 'TOUCHING' PHOTO \u201cI do not attend Church of the Highlands,\u201d Jasmine Faith Clisby told AL.com, adding that she isn't \"judging him\" or \"saying he's racist\" but \"[Hodges]\u00a0likes someone who posts things that do not seem culturally sensitive to me.\" The Carver High School teacher slammed Kirk for saying white privilege is a myth. One of the posts, according to AL.com, shows two photos\u00a0\u2014 one of President\u00a0Trump standing next to Muhammad Ali and Rosa Parks with the caption \u201cThe racist Donald Trump in the 1980s,\u201d and the other\u00a0Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam with two men wearing blackface and a KKK costume with the caption \u201cProgressive Leftist Ralph Northam in the 1980s.\u201d Another screenshot showed former President Barack Obama playing golf beneath a quote from Michelle Obama urging people to stay home except for essential activities. Another screenshot shows Hodges liking a photo of Kirk donating blood above the sentence, \u201cWe all must do our part to defeat China Virus.\u201d Kirk, who was scheduled to speak to Church of the Highlands' youth group, told Fox News he is \"deeply saddened\" that he is \"being slandered by the mob for stating mainstream pieces of widely-cited data and public information.\" \"I\u00a0have had wonderful times of fellowship with Chris in the past and think he is a gifted ambassador for Christ,\" Kirk said. \"I didn't ask him to like my posts, he did so on his own. I will never apologize for stating irrefutable facts, and nor should he.\" Hodges, who has been active in the Evangelicals for Trump Coalition, shared a lengthy letter with his congregation Tuesday in his third public apology after the teacher's social media post. CHRISTIAN BAND RESPONDS TO ITS LEAD SINGER SAYING HE NO LONGER BELIEVES IN GOD \"After taking the time to review and reflect, I can tell you those social media posts that I 'liked'\u00a0do not reflect, in any way, my true feelings or beliefs,\" Hodges explained.\u00a0\"I now realize they were hurtful and divisive, and I sincerely apologize. \"I own my mistakes and ask forgiveness from those I have offended. Please know that I have learned, and will continue to learn, so much from this,\" he said.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks as he kicks off his train tour following the first presidential debate. CLEVELAND \u2013 In his first public event since trading fire with President Trump at a very combustible presidential debate, Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u00a0told the crowd the president \u201clies to you\u201d and emphasized that his showdown with Trump \u201cwas supposed to be about you.\u201d The comments from the former vice president, who for decades commuted daily on Amtrak from his home in Delaware to the nation\u2019s capital, came as he kicked off a daylong tour through eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, two crucial battleground states that will likely help decide the winner of the presidential election. DEBATE PAYS INSTANT DIVIDENDS FOR BIDEN AS CAMPAIGN TOUTS FUNDRAISING RECORD \u201cLast night\u2019s debate in this election was supposed to be about you \u2026 all the people who make the difference,\u201d Biden said Wednesday morning at a campaign event in Cleveland, minutes before launching his train trip. Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Cleveland was considered the ugliest in modern history, with repeated interruptions and both candidates hurling charges and insults at each other. But while the president exclusively spoke directly to Biden or to the moderator \u2013 \"Fox News Sunday\"\u00a0anchor Chris Wallace \u2013 the former vice president repeatedly pivoted and looked directly into the camera as he spoke to American voters. Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden, accompanied by his wife Jill Biden, right, speaks at Amtrak's Cleveland Lakefront train station, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020, in Cleveland, Biden is on a train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania today. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) As he kicked off his train tour, Biden once again painted a picture of the president as a wealthy billionaire out of touch with average Americans. \u201cDoes your president understand at all what you\u2019re going through? What so many other people are going through?\u00a0The question is, Does he see where you are and where you want to be? Does he care? Has he tried to walk in your shoes to understand what\u2019s going on in your life or does he just ignore you?\u201d Biden asked. And Biden reprised an attack line he\u2019s used in recent weeks, spotlighting his working-class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania and contrasting it with Trump\u2019s upbringing among wealth and privilege. WATCH: JOE BIDEN KICKS OFF OHIO-PENNSYLVANIA TRAIN TRIP \u201cI look at things from a Scranton perspective. He looks at it from Park Avenue. And I think he looks down on us. He judges us,\u201d Biden argued. Biden was introduced by Tiffany Davis, a fifth grade elementary school teacher and cancer survivor from Girard, Ohio, whose\u00a0husband now commutes each week to a General Motors plant in Bowling Green, Ky., after the nearby Lordstown, Ohio, GM plant closed down a year and a half ago. Trump was able to tap into the angst of workers at the Lordstown plant and others in the state in 2016 as he won Ohio by eight\u00a0points over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At a rally in nearby Youngstown,\u00a0in 2017\u00a0Trump promised residents that manufacturing jobs would be returning and told the crowd, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house.\u201d But Trump wasn\u2019t able to keep GM from closing the plant during his presidency. TRUMP'S WARNING ON VOTING BY MAIL: 'THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL' Biden on Tuesday charged that the president \u201clies\" to them. \"He lies to you about exactly what\u2019s happening \u2026 He said, 'Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t sell your house because no Ohio factory will shut down in Donald Trump\u2019s America.'\u201d And he claimed that Trump, \u201cin his four years as president, he\u2019s broken his promise. He\u2019s forgotten the forgotten Americans he always said he was going to fight for.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks to supporters before boarding his train at Amtrak's Cleveland Lakefront train station, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020, in Cleveland, Biden is on a train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania today. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Biden said that during his train tour, he\u2019d be \u201ctalking to the folks\" about how he will\u00a0\"get the virus under control, lay out the plan, bring Congress together provide relief and resources to schools and businesses so we can reopen our economy and safely and strongly with a real a plan and real leadership.\u201d Looking back to his days commuting on Amtrak during his nearly four decades representing Delaware in the Senate, Biden spotlighted,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve logged more than 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak.\u201d THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 BIDEN-TRUMP BATTLE Pointing to his Wilmington, Del.,\u00a0to Washington, D.C. commute, he said: \u201cI took that 250 mile roundtrip journey each day. I\u2019d get to know the train engineers, conductors, the fellow passengers.\u201d Biden, who was known as \u201cAmtrak Joe\u201d during his Senate years, greeted supporters and Amtrak employees as he boarded the train. He also acknowledged a small group of supporters who were standing on top of a building across the train tracks. After departing Cleveland, Biden and his wife Jill stopped in Alliance, Ohio. The train was then scheduled to make stops in western Pennsylvania, in\u00a0Pittsburgh, Greenburg, New Alexandria, Latrobe and Johnstown. An average of the latest public opinion polls in Ohio compiled by Real Clear Politics shows Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with a 3.3 point edge over the president. That includes a Fox News poll conducted Sept. 20-Sept. 23 and released last week that had\u00a0the former vice president topping Trump 50% to 45% among likely voters in Ohio. An average of the latest polls in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania\u00a0compiled by Real Clear Politics indicates a close contest \u2013 with Biden edging the president by 5.7 points. The new average includes a Fox News poll released Thursday that showed the former vice president with a seven-point lead over Trump. Pennsylvania \u2013 along with Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 had been carried by the Democrats in presidential elections for a quarter-century. But Trump narrowly edged\u00a0Clinton in all three states four years ago, helping him win the White House. An average of the final polls on the eve of the 2016 election gave\u00a0Clinton with a 2.2 point edge over Trump in the Keystone State, but Trump edged the Democrat\u00a0by seven-tenths of a percent to capture Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral votes.

LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. I'm Lisa Boothe filling in for Tucker. In just a few minutes, Mark Steyn will be reemerging, and Tucker is back to join him. But first, mayhem has gripped the City of Portland, Oregon, take a look. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] BOOTHE: Portland has now experienced 50 straight days of leftwing violence. Last night, a violent mob attempted to overrun a police station and burn it to the ground. They've toppled statues, destroyed property and attacked the police. Here's one report from earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): According to police, not only did protesters take over the streets, but some lobbed paint, rocks, bottles and more at them last night. Portland Police say one officer was hurt slightly when a brick was thrown at him. Police say protesters also interfered with an arrest and pointed lasers at their eyes. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Portland's leaders have failed to rein in the violence. It's not clear they're even trying. Instead, they're casting blame on the Federal law enforcement officers trying to restore order. Here's Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR TED WHEELER (D-OR), PORTLAND: What I have a problem with is them leaving the facilities, going out onto the streets of this community in an escalating an already tense situation like they did the other night. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Got that? Law enforcement is responsible for the violence. The looting, the arson, the graffiti is their fault, not the mobs. Portland's mayor is telling you the exact opposite of the truth. Here's how one Portland police officer described the mob. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It says something when you're at a Black Lives Matter protest, you have more minorities on the police side than you have in a violent crowd. And you have white people screaming at black officers. You have the biggest nose I've ever seen. Having people tell you, you know, what to do with your life, that you need to quit your job, that you need to -- you know, you're hurting your community, but they're not a part of the community, and once again, you as a privileged white person telling someone of color what to do with your life. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Jason Rantz is a Seattle based radio show who has been following the madness in Portland, Oregon. He joins us now. Jason, what in the world is going on in Portland, Oregon? Walk us through what you've been seeing. JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes, so what we're seeing is what it seems like, total lawlessness because local leaders don't want to get involved in Antifa violence. There is this movement who try to pretend that this is a Black Lives Matter protest, that these are all innocent people who are being violated. Their rights are being violated by the Trump administration, and D.H.S., and that's obviously not what's going on. What we're seeing here is escalating violence every single night, and finally, the Federal government said, look, we can't let a city get this out of control. If you want to go after downtown Portland. Okay. That's up to you guys there. But you're not going after Federal facilities, Federal buildings. Last night, 21 individuals were arrested. Some of the things, not just throwing bricks, but throwing water bottles at officers that are frozen, so their intent is to do harm and what we're seeing online is this strategy on Twitter with the Antifa videos that are basically serving as propaganda that Senator Merkley is sending around. Where you get a little bit of an interaction with an officer or a Federal agent making an arrest, you get no context. And then all of a sudden the ACLU is saying, we've got these Gestapo-like tactics. We have people who are just being whisked away in the dead of night, when that's not happening at all. I mean, part of the reason why we're seeing some of the video of the unmarked cars, is when you've got marked vehicles, when you've got Portland Police trying to make arrests, they face assault. And so you quickly go in there, you get rid of the people who are either committing acts of violence or accused, you make the arrest, you book them, and then they're released. You're doing this in a way that basically makes it so that there's not going to be violence. BOOTHE: So, you know, what's all this about? Because we've heard from the Portland police officer earlier who said that he has seen black police officers face racism for the people there who are claiming that they're fighting for black lives. You know, so what's really going on in the country? What's behind all of this? RANTZ: What's behind specifically in Portland is an ideological agenda to push socialist viewpoints and far fringe progressive viewpoints. This has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter. You've got a bunch of privileged white kids who are shouting racist remarks at black officers and committing acts of violence without getting in real trouble. I mean, if you want to talk about white privilege, that seems like white privilege. There is an end goal of getting rid of policing as we know it. They want to break down institutions, whether it's policing or the justice system or just capitalism, and they want to rebuild these institutions in their own ideological image. And of course, you have to do that when -- to get to that point, you get to be a little bit violent. You have to intimidate. This is a domestic terroristic act. To use your ideology, to try to frighten people, to bully people using violence to get to your means and I'm glad finally President Trump is stepping up here and sending in the Federal government. BOOTHE: Is it working? RANTZ: It's working. Look at this point. It's become a little bit political, right? I mean, the President is showing he is the law and order President. He's going up against Joe Biden, who he is painting as quite the opposite. The Democrats are now using this as an excuse not to go after the Antifa activists. Instead, they're saying, this is Portland versus Trump or Seattle versus Trump, New York versus Trump. That gets them a little bit of coverage so they don't actually have to go after, frankly, their base of support on the ground who is responsible for all of this. BOOTHE: Jason, thanks for joining us. I appreciate it. RANTZ: Thank you so much. BOOTHE: Portland isn't the only city falling apart. Police in Minneapolis say the Black Lives Matter protests have ironically, made many black neighborhoods much more dangerous. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OFFICER RICH WALKER, MINNESOTA PUBLIC AND POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATES: We've had close to 20 homicides in the City of Minneapolis since Memorial Day. We've had upwards of 140 people shot in our city since Memorial Day, including a murder that just happened yesterday. We're averaging two to three shootings a day and that's -- and that message is not out there. That message is that crime is rampant in Minneapolis right now. It is lawlessness over there and the criminals are emboldened right now to do whatever they want to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Things are even worse in Chicago. So far this month, 54 people are dead and nearly 250 wounded in shootings citywide. Mayor Lori Lightfoot doesn't care though. She has decided to role play as the sidekick to a fictional cowboy. I wish I was joking, but I'm not. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: When I was a kid, I loved the \"Batman\" TV show, and when the City of Gotham had a real difficult challenge, one of the things that the mayor there did is he called out and he sent out the distress signal to Batman. So we are doing something similar for the census, and I'm happy to report I'm calling out the Census Cowboy. That means you've got to step up and do your part and make sure that you fill out the census. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: This is real. But no matter how successful Census Cowboy is, he's not likely to change the dire situation that is going on in Chicago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I've listed for you the names of these kids who have died across this country. It is unacceptable, and under this President, he'll take action and the derelict Mayor of Chicago should step up and ask for Federal help because she's doing a very poor job at securing her streets. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Lori Lightfoot didn't appreciate that criticism. She lashed back at the White House by referring to Kayleigh McEnany as Karen, one of the few racial epithets the left doesn't get offended by. Professor Jason Hill teaches Philosophy at DePaul University in Chicago. He's also the author of the book, \"We Have Overcome\" and joins us now. So, Professor, why did the mayor call Kayleigh a Karen? What's behind that? JASON HILL, PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, DEPAUL UNIVERSITY: I think it's just the deflection of a really hurt dereliction of duty and the dereliction of the duty of the Governor of Illinois. Look, if one could really ostensibly point to dereliction of duty, I think the governance of Illinois in the State of Chicago should be in that space. You know, I speak not as a Republican but as an Independent conservative. And two years ago, Lisa, I wrote a letter to the President asking him to send National Troops into Chicago to quell the gang violence. That was two years ago, because at that time, the crime rate was 35 percent above the national average. Right? It is disgraceful. Innocent children, women, men, good people of Chicago are being killed. We have ferality of these gang members, sociopaths that are being unleashed and I think she made that statement to deflect from the way in which she and the governor and other political actors in the state are guilty of dereliction of duty. And to put the tones of responsibility -- BOOTHE: Can you get and tell us a little bit more -- talk about that dereliction of duty? HILL: Can I what? BOOTHE: Can you talk a little bit more about the dereliction of duty? HILL: This is an ongoing problem. This predated, you know, the murder of George Floyd which was a horrible thing, which everybody agrees was a tragedy and horrible. This has been going -- I've been teaching at DePaul for 20 years. I moved to Chicago 20 years ago, and this has been an ongoing problem. When I moved here, it was a huge problem. Policemen first of all are underpaid. Right? They are overworked. There is no incentive. They're not incentivized by the mayor or any of the political actors in this state to make any sort of friendly intrusions or excursions or alliances or community building with members of the Southside of Chicago where these crimes are predominantly occurring. They have a very, very bad name, which is not helped by the governance structures of this city that aid and abet in bad naming the police officer of Chicago. And rather than help foster healthy alliances between local police, criminal and law enforcement, and citizens, law-abiding citizens in these neighborhoods where the crimes are occurring, dissent is being fostered, I think. That's just one form of dereliction of duty. BOOTHE: Continue. HILL: Go ahead. No, you go ahead. BOOTHE: Okay. Well, so we hear -- you know, we're hearing these calls in cities across the country to defund the police, to decrease the police presence, but if you look at statistics, isn't it black lives who are going to be further harmed and in danger as a result of a decreased police presence? HILL: Absolutely. I wrote in my book, there's a whole chapter where I took Black Lives Matter to case and said, turn your signs inward towards the black community, and ask yourselves when you say Black Lives Matter, who is doing the killing of these black people? It's not white suburban citizens. It's not mainly police officers who are killing these black kids. It's gang bangers, right? It's these feral thugs who are sociopathic killers, who are making communities absolutely obsolete. Right? They're destroying communities and they are -- they are good people. Most of these people who live in these communities are hardworking good people. I teach some of these kids who cannot cross gang lines into our community, to come to school. BOOTHE: Professor, thank you so much. HILL: Yes, I think the whole thing is tragic. BOOTHE: I do too, sir. I really do. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. We really appreciate your insight. Thank you. HILL: Thank you. BOOTHE: Thank you. So there are also new questions over whether Florida counties are correctly tabulating coronavirus deaths. Fox 35 Orlando reporter, Danielle Lama has this story -- Danielle. DANIELLE LAMA, FOX 35 REPORTER: Well, hey there, Lisa. Yes, this is coming up because we were speaking with the Orange County Health Officer yesterday about some of the numbers regarding coronavirus deaths and we had noticed that two people in their 20s had died from COVID, and so we asked him if there were any underlying conditions involved. And one of the answers really surprised us. He told us that one person actually died in a motorcycle accident and he told us that that had gone into the COVID numbers and he had asked the state to remove that number and when asked if it had actually been removed or cleared from that data, he said he didn't think so, he wasn't sure. But he was going to double check on that. And so that's when we started asking questions here. BOOTHE: And what exactly did you do? Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what you found and what questions you asked? LAMA: Right. So we were told that it was a man in his 20s, who did test positive for coronavirus, but had died because he was in a motorcycle accident. And so then today, we've been trying to follow up on this to figure out if this is still currently in the state data. And so the Orange County Health Officers, his office is telling that they are still working to try and confirm that to see if that death was cleared from the system. We also reached out to the medical examiner here in Orange County because those folks have to certify the COVID deaths. And he told us that that death would not be qualified as a coronavirus death. His exact quote was, \"We only ascribe COVID deaths if COVID is the cause of death or contributed to the cause of death,\" and we also have of course reached out to the State Department of Health. They tell us that their health department's COVID-19 death is determined if COVID-19 is listed as the immediate or underlying cause of death or listed as one of the significant conditions contributing to the death. So, of course, a lot of questions about how a motorcycle accident may have ended up in that state data, and you know, a lot is riding on these numbers. And people want to make sure that these are accurate. There are big decisions, schools, governments making decisions, looking at the data. So that's why we're asking these questions when we hear something like this. BOOTHE: Oh, you're 100 percent -- I mean, we're making public health decisions. We're making decisions that have economic consequences as well, mental health consequences. So Danielle, stay on it. We appreciate your reporting. LAMA: Thank you. BOOTHE: Thank you. So how concerned should we be about the miscounts in Florida? The one and only Dr. Marc Siegel is here and that's next. Also Mark Steyn returns to primetime as this live special edition of TUCKER CARLSON continues. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: Florida is apparently one of the epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic, but are the numbers accurate? Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox News medical contributor, and he joins us. Hi, Doctor. So, Doctor, we're seeing these -- DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Lisa, how are you? Listen, the numbers are -- BOOTHE: Yes, tell me about the numbers. Do they concern you? These inaccuracies? SIEGEL: Well, the numbers are not accurate, Lisa because we're seeing inflated numbers. We're seeing counties that are reporting 100 percent positive. I spoke to Assistant Secretary of H.H.S. -- Health and Human Services Admiral Giroir about that this week. He acknowledges the problem. He says Health and Human Services is trying to correct it. There's also people listed as COVID deaths that died from something else. There's a mistake going on there. So all of that is true, but I still am very concerned about the overall trend in Florida. That's clearly a problem. I spoke to Senior Associate Dean of the University of South Florida, Dr. Jay Wolfson tonight and he said to me, look, the ICUs in Tampa are filling up; in Miami, they are filling up; in Fort Lauderdale they are filling up. In the major cities, a lot of it are non-COVID cases, but now the state is shutting down. A lot of the elective surgeries -- so-called elective surgeries, a lot of the heart disease surgeries, a lot of the cancer surgeries, hernia surgeries, just as we saw in New York. And there's a lot of concern about that problem. And you know what at the heart of the problem is? Dr. Wolfson told me that the State Health Department has showed a decrease in funding of over 25 percent over the last 15 years. This, Lisa, is what Governor DeSantis inherited. No epidemic preparedness. No pandemic preparedness of any nature at a high level. The state wasn't ready for this and they're not ready for it now. Scrambling, trying to handle the problem, dealing with overinflated cases, dealing with deaths wrongly stated as COVID-19. The solution to all of this even with a diminished funding is coming together behind the science instead of the bureaucracy, Lisa. We've got to get rid of all this bureaucracy. That's for sure. BOOTHE: Well, and I also think people should be reporting on the facts, not fear, which unfortunately, I don't think we've seen from many in the media. But Doctor, we appreciate you because you focus on the facts and not the fear. So thank you, sir. We appreciate you joining us tonight. SIEGEL: Thank you, Lisa. BOOTHE: Thank you. So across the country, in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered his constituents to follow a second wave of mandatory shutdowns. Not everyone is happy about it though. Gym owner, Mike Ends is refusing to shut down. Now, he is paying a price for it. He joins us. Mike, so how are you doing with all of this? MIKE ENDS, GYM OWNER DEFYING SHUTDOWN ORDER: It's really tough right now. I'm currently building a new location across the street and I'm supposed to open in 10 days and I spent the last three and a half to four years building this from the ground up. BOOTHE: So do you think -- I mean, look when we see the coverage of the coronavirus, obviously, the focus is on the health aspect of it, which is, of course, incredibly important. But we don't really hear about the stories of people like you and business owners across the country that are suffering. Why don't we hear as much about it? ENDS: You know, because then you're going to have to face the facts. There's -- you know, it's crazy that they leave liquor stores and they leave you know, marijuana dispensaries open, but then, you can't go to church so you can't be spiritually healthy. You can't be physically healthy. You can't be mentally healthy. But you can go get drunk and smoke weed. BOOTHE: So, does that tell you a lot about the Governor's priorities? ENDS: It tells me everything I need to know about the guy. You know, he picks and chooses winners and losers and that's not what governors do. BOOTHE: So what's been the impact to you, personally, as a business owner? I thought or I saw you or heard you recently say that it almost crippled you and your business. ENDS: It has crippled me. You know, I have a $12 million dollar investment that I'm supposed to open in in 10 days and I shut down for three months. I followed the orders. I did everything he asked me to do and then he let looters and people raid the streets and destroy our country and then all he did was he asked them to not do that, but then he mandates small businesses to shut down and stop feeding our families and stop providing for children and you know shut down schools. BOOTHE: Do you have hope for the future? ENDS: I do. I feel like, you know, America is going to stand up and fight back. I think we're at the end of listening to all this nonsense. BOOTHE: Mike, thank you so much and we're praying for you. I know it's been a tough time. Thank you for joining us tonight. ENDS: Okay. Yes, thank you. BOOTHE: Thank you. So the man, the myth, the legend. It's almost time for Mark Steyn. The best moments of Mark and Tucker going at it. That's up after the break. You're not going to want to miss it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: So 2020 has so far been a dramatic and absolutely absurd and tumultuous year with a presidential election right around the corner, it's likely that things aren't going to calm down anytime soon. But one constant force amid all the tumult is bestselling author, Mark Steyn. Here are some of his best moments discussing the 2020 candidates with Tucker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: This is Biden at top form where he does this vivid, coherent, brilliant narrative in which not a single detail is correct. So, he just stands up and he goes, you know, it's 20 minutes before dawn on D-Day and this nine-star general says to me, Mr. President, it's too dangerous for you to go in there, but I say the Minutemen are taking me on the Bengal lancers, so I flew in on a glider from Diego Garcia and we came under heavy fire from a group of whirling dervishes holed up in Brigitte Bardot's apartment outside Euro Disney. And I said to them, I'm the first Biden in a thousand years to go to college. So, I know what it's like to be the best of the best. This was classic Joe Biden. He is back. His mojo has returned. His mojo knows what state it's in. TEXT: On Bloomberg blowing the debate. STEYN: You have to hand it to the Cherokee dominatrix. She is not going to be the candidate, but she actually uttered that phrase you just played horse-face lesbians, which I believe has not been used in any presidential debate, since I believe Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland. But to flay him for calling women horse face lesbians and he just stood there, looking rather horse-faced himself unable to respond to it. And then she starts -- then she starts going on about non-disclosure agreements. He won't disclose how many non-disclosure agreements he signed and eventually, it's such a lively debate that miracle of miracles, Joe Biden wakes up and he starts having a swig. God, like come on, man. God love you man. NDA, man. I played for the NBA years ago. My son owns an NBA franchise the Chinese General gave him. TEXT: On Biden's forgetfulness. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Author and columnist Mike Steyn joins us today. Mike, thanks so much for coming on. Mark, Mark. STEYN: Hey, my pleasure. Thanks, Martha. Always a pleasure. Yes, I believe we have breaking news. He has just been endorsed by Mao Zedong and, yes, Mad King Ludvig of Bavaria, so he's looking in pretty good shape for Super Tuesday. TEXT: On the Buttigieg campaign. STEYN: Well, I quite like the fact that he's bought -- the only other guy with this name that I've ever run across was from Malta. So I quite like the idea of a Maltese-American President, but the Maltese-American parade down Fifth Avenue on Maltese-American day is actually one of the smallest I've been to in all of these parades. And I do believe that Hillary Clinton -- CARLSON: It's a single Chevy. STEYN: Yes, and Hillary is blaming her defeat on Maltese content farmers when she's had a couple of drinks and can't remember Macedonia. TEXT: On young Bernie supporters. STEYN: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right that Bernie supporters think that their parents and grandparents are fascists, racists, homophobes, islamophobes, thisaphobes, thataphobes and their parents just think the kids are stupid. But they can be stupid in a mildly diverting way and if it's a choice between, you know, sleeping off Christmas dinner over \"The Price Is Right\" or listening to your kid say that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talks a lot of sense about how fascist America is and my God, we'd be more like Venezuela where they're so environmentally enlightened, they've abolish toilet paper. I don't know that in terms of entertainment over the Christmas lunch that, I don't think it persuades anyone. TEXT: On Biden's corn pop story. STEYN: Corn pop, it must be terribly annoying to face down a guy who is trying to cut you with a razor and you want to tell your friends about it and the only fly in the ointment is that he is corn pop who was, as you correctly pointed out the third shock on the left in the last summer stock revival I saw of \"West Side Story.\" I mean, it doesn't work it's like as a bad hombre name. So he has a basic problem there. But, you know, essentially he -- it's like Barry Manilow, I think what was that? It is from \"Copacabana,\" I think. His name was corn pop. He had a razor -- it made the brilliant bit. It's in the second chorus of \"Copacabana.\" CARLSON: Yes, I think you were in boarding school in the U.K. in third grade. But for those of us who grew up in this country, we know that corn pops are actually one of the sugary brands of sugar cereal available, which seems ... STEYN: Right. It's not a good name for a gang member. That's pretty good. It's the attention to detail. He says, for example, that the way you make the straight razor rusty is to put it in a rainbow, like a milk toast like you, Tucker, you've got indoor plumbing and you think you can just run it under the faucet. But in fact, you have to have an actual rain barrel. The details of this, anecdote are brilliant. They should be teaching it. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: Mark Steyn is such a character, also, who knew he could carry a tune? I didn't know that. Well, we learned that tonight. Well, when Joe Biden first entered the Senate in 1973, it's a long time ago, Pink Floyd was topping the charts. Richard Nixon was proclaiming his innocence. Times have changed and so has Joe Biden. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: Joe Biden needs to appeal to blue collar workers to win the White House. For a long time pretending to be a good old boy from Scranton was his specialty. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I hope you won't hold it against me, but I am a hard cold miner, anthracite coal Scranton, Pennsylvania. Okay, that's where I was born and raised, and it's nice to be back in coal country. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: But I guess it all depends on his audience. Now old miner Joe Biden wants to get rid of fossil fuels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: We are going to get rid of fossil fuels. These guys are okay. They want to do the same thing I want to do. They want to phase out fossil fuels and we're going to phase out fossil fuels. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOOTHE: So as you might expect, the people he was pandering to in 2008 are horrified. Pennsylvania and Jim Snell who works for a local steamfitters union told \"The Washington Examiner\" this. He said, \"I am completely shocked and stunned about the language coming from Joe Biden, allegedly a union guy. The Democratic Party has kicked the building trades to the curb, and they're all in with the environment groups.\" A registered Democrat named Jim Cassidy who works for an insulators union in Pennsylvania expressed similar sentiments, saying, \"Is Joe Biden really one of us? I always love the man. He scares me now. He is embracing the Green New Deal or whatever they're calling it. He needs to get some stuff straight.\" Justin Haskins is Executive Editor at the Heartland Institute. He joins us. Justin, former Vice President Joe Biden rolled out his climate change agenda this week with the help of AOC and Bernie Sanders. How would that impact many of these blue collar workers like the ones we just heard from? JUSTIN HASKINS, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, HEARTLAND INSTITUTE: Yes, well, they would be absolutely decimated by this plan. Effectively the key part of the plan, there's all sorts of crap that's been stuffed into it, but the key part of the plan is transitioning the entire electric grid, making it carbon dioxide free supposedly by 2035. That means building billions not millions, but billions of solar panels and wind turbines all over the country, which would be absolutely terrible for the environment, by the way. It would require consuming massive millions of acres of land, killing millions of animals. But then on top of that, it would dramatically increase the cost of energy for the entire country. Isaac Orr or at the Center of the American Experiment did a great article about this recently where he showed that if you take the increase in electricity cost for the whole country that would occur under Joe Biden's plan, it would be at least a trillion dollars more per year. And depending on how much of the mix of wind and solar is in that mix, you would have it be even higher than that. It could be several trillion dollars every single year in additional cost. That means millions and millions of jobs shipped overseas. It would absolutely decimate the Midwest and places like Pennsylvania. This is a total disaster and a complete betrayal by Joe Biden. BOOTHE: Well, so about that, so we heard his comment back in February where he was talking about getting rid of fossil fuels. If you remember in 2016, Hillary Clinton said that she was going to put coal miners out of work. Do you think this comment will have the same impact? It cost for states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. HASKINS: I mean, I hope people are listening. Right. I hope people are listening because the reality is that the Joe Biden that these people think they know is gone. That guy left the building. Okay. Joe Biden can barely put two sentences together, never mind the whole climate change plan without all sorts of help from these far leftwing people that he's brought into his campaign. People like Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, people from the socialist sunrise movement, who were involved in the Green New Deal. People like -- all sorts of incredibly radical people like Stephanie Kelton, who doesn't even believe in debts or deficits. That she doesn't think they actually matter at all. She thinks you can print as much money as you need. These are the people who are now advising Joe Biden. These are Bernie Sanders -- his influence on the campaign normally -- BOOTHE: And so, Justin -- HASKINS: Go ahead. BOOTHE: Yes, Justin, I want to get into that because typically what you see from candidates, we both know, what you typically see is during the primary, you have candidates move further to the left, further to the right and then they moderate in a general election. Biden seems to be doing the opposite, particularly on the climate change issues. Why is that? HASKINS: Yes, that's a fantastic point. I think it's because he is desperately afraid of losing this election because the far left rejects him. I don't think he is trying to win over people in the middle. It's a really strange election strategy. But I think that's the only way to explain this. I think what he's trying to do is keep the far leftwing progressive and socialist base of his party, the AOC's of the world, the Bernie Sanders of the world happy because he is worried that those people are going to walk out on him at the last minute, and then ruin his chances of winning on that side of things. And so he's trying to do everything he can to appeal to those people. And those people are incredibly radical. So a vote for Joe Biden is really not a vote for Joe Biden from 20 years ago, or 10 years ago, or even five years ago. It's a vote for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders and people like that. BOOTHE: Well, and the big question is, you know, how does this impact him in the Rust Belt, right? I mean, the Rust Belt was key to President Trump's victory in 2016. It is going to be key to anyone winning in 2020 as well. HASKINS: Yes, I mean, it all comes down to who do you trust, right? Who do you trust? And in this particular case, this man has been making promises for years and years and years. And now he has completely betrayed those promises, moved in the polar opposite direction, sold his soul to the far leftwing of the Democratic Party to the socialist wing, and especially the eco-socialist wing of the Democratic Party. And so yes, do you trust Joe Biden? That's a question that voters are going to have to ask. And if you look at his record, I think that there are reasons to be concerned. BOOTHE: Justin, thank you. We appreciate it. HASKINS: Thanks so much. BOOTHE: Major new developments in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. Emily Compagno host \"Crimes that Changed America\" on Fox Nation, and she joins us -- Emily. EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Lisa. As you know, Ghislaine Maxwell has been charged with six Federal crimes, four of which involve transporting minors for illegal sexual activity to which she has pled not guilty. At her detention hearing after testimony by victims and arguments by the prosecution, the judge denied bail, ruling her a flight risk and said she had both quote, \"motive and opportunity to flee.\" Prosecutor cited in part her attempt to evade arrest when the F.B.I. came to her multimillion dollar home in New Hampshire. She and her alleged boyfriend, Scott Borgerson had apparently been ostracized at his home in Massachusetts after neighbors learned of her identity, including revoking all privileges like beach access that that neighborhood enjoys. Now reports are swirling that Jeffrey Epstein personal assistant Sarah Kellen might be arrested next, though Kellen's parents argue she was just another victim swept up in Maxwell and Epstein's sexual abuse and sex trafficking ring. In a lawsuit which named Kellen as a defendant, she is described as Maxwell's second in command, her assistant and even Lieutenant. Kellen worked for Epstein for around 10 years as a personal assistant and has been accused by victims of complicity in their sexual abuse, including taking nude photographs of victims. The trial for Ghislaine Maxwell has been set for July 12, 2021 -- Lisa. BOOTHE: Great reporting. Thank you. COMPAGNO: Thank you. BOOTHE: So it's not clear if Kanye West is actually running for President, but he definitely will be on the ballot in at least one state. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: This is a Fox News Alert. You're looking at live pictures of rioters in downtown Chicago shooting fireworks and throwing objects at police officers who are defending a statue of Christopher Columbus. The situation appears to be deteriorating quickly. The police are surrounded and outnumbered by the crowd. Stay tuned to Fox News as we follow the story for you. And there's this, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is undergoing chemotherapy to treat a recurrence of liver cancer. The 87-year-old justice has survived cancer before. She was admitted to the hospital earlier this week for an infection, but was released after a day. We're also going to continue monitoring that story for you and we're praying for her health and safety as well. And there's also this. Rapper Kanye West seems to be shifting gears a little bit. Rapper Kanye West seems to be moving forward with his presidential bid. Yesterday he filed documents with the Federal Election Committee. Today, he officially filed to be on the ballots in Oklahoma and tweeted an image of Mount Rushmore with his face added to it. Jason Nichols is a professor at the University of Maryland and he joins us. Jason, how are you my friend? JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: I'm doing good, Lisa, and congratulations when you get your own show. Please remember the little people. BOOTHE: Oh, stop. I appreciate that though. Thank you. You're too kind. You know, so Jason, Kanye is making moves. What do you make of this? NICHOLS: I think he's somewhat serious about this, even you know, with Oklahoma. We know that in other states that, you know, there are reports that he's trying to gather signatures in order to get on the ballots in other states. I don't think there's any chance that he is going to win. But I think people need to understand the power of a protest vote. I think there are many people who are completely dissatisfied with the direction the country is going under Donald Trump and there are people who don't like Joe Biden or don't think that he is coherent or competent, or whatever it is. That's the narrative that's being spread. And they're looking for someone -- you know, another option, the same thing that happened in 2016 when you saw the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein. I don't know anybody who actually agreed with Jill Stein. She's an anti- vaxxer. She's kind of a strange character, but at the same time, they voted for her because they were dissatisfied with both Hillary Clinton and they didn't like Donald Trump. I think that could be very well happened with Kanye West, which will etch him into the history books, which I think is part of his purpose here. BOOTHE: Well, I mean, we saw you mention Jill Stein. I mean, she was a spoiler in 2016. Do you think Kanye has the opportunity to do the same thing here? And also, who would it impact Joe Biden? Or Donald Trump? NICHOLS: That's a tough question. I think he absolutely can be a spoiler. We've got to remember in Wisconsin, I think it was decided about 77,000 votes, if he's able to get on some of these ballots, and this is going to be a razor thin election. It's going to be very similar to 2016, I think. We see the national polls and, you know, there's a separation by double digits, but I think that's going to narrow. I think it's going to be a close election. I think Joe Biden will probably come out on top, but you never know. And I think, you know, this could be a situation where Kanye West takes youth voters from Joe Biden and takes, you know, some voters from Donald Trump as well. So this is -- it's going to be a toss-up. He's a very interesting character. This is a very interesting time we're living in and I'm excited to see how it shakes out. BOOTHE: I mean, that is for sure. Look, you know, he supports policies like you know, pro-life. What kind of platform do you think we'd see him run on? NICHOLS: Well, I think one of his strong points, of course, is criminal justice reform. His wife is someone who advocated for that. And I think that's a big reason why he could be trouble for Donald Trump. I think people who saw Donald Trump and said, oh, well all the claims that Donald Trump is racist. They're offset by the fact that he is an advocate for criminal justice reform and I use advocate very loosely, but at the same time, Kanye West can take that from him. The Alice Johnson commutation was more her work, arguably than Donald Trump. It was her -- BOOTHE: I don't know about that. But you've also -- you know, Jason, but you've also seen, you know, Joe Biden has said some pretty offensive things about black Americans as well. I mean, could that impact him with people potentially looking to Kanye? NICHOLS: Oh, I think both candidates are going to you know, have to think about Kanye West, in the back of their minds. If he can get, you know, 70,000 to 80,000 votes in one of these states, he could sway an election. I think this is going to be very, very, very close, particularly with COVID-19. The fact that people may not be voting in person, there's going to be, you know, maybe even lower turnout than usual. I think Kanye West and protest voters could really shift this election. BOOTHE: Well, it's certainly going to be interesting, but I think, you know, criminal justice reform did happen under President Trump, not the Obama administration. So I think it's going to be hard for anyone else to claim that mantle. But Professor, we're going to be watching it and I appreciate you joining us tonight. It's great to see you. NICHOLS: Thank you, Lisa. Great seeing you. BOOTHE: Well, that's about it for us tonight. It was so much fun. Tune in each night at eight to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Also don't forget to DVR the show, if you haven't set it already. Have a great evening.

I'm Juan Williams, along with Jesse Watters, Dagen Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, and Dagen McDowell. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. You're looking live at a ship-building plant in Wisconsin. President Trump set to deliver remarks there at any moment. We'll monitor it for you and see if there's any breaking news. But in the meantime, U.S. marshals and unarmed National Guard troops on standby to help protect monuments in Washington, D.C. President Trump vowing to crackdown after protesters attempted to topple an Andrew Jackson near the White House statue earlier this week. The president also threatening 10 years in prison for protesters tearing down statues in an executive order he's set to sign. And a black lives matter leader getting a lot of attention for saying this when pressed about some of the violence taking place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This country is built upon violence. What was the American Revolution, which are -- are -- are -- are diplomacy across the globe. So for any American to accuse us of being violent, it's extremely hypocritical. If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it, all right? And I can be speaking figuratively. I can be speaking literally. It's a matter of interpretation. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And in a town hall set to air tonight on Hannity, President Trump going after Democratic-run cities. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They don't do something with Seattle. We're going to do that. We're going to go in there. Because what is happening, they're taking over American cities. By the way, in all cases, it's Democrats. They're Democrat-run, in all cases. And Joe Biden would have that be the whole country. It's so crazy what is happening. Here's a guy that doesn't talk. Nobody hears him. Whenever he does talk, he can't put two sentences together. I don't want to be nice or un-nice, OK, but I mean, the man can't speak. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Dana, you know, my violence is wrong obviously. But local police should be able to handle it. And so far they're not asking for help. So why is President Trump talking about National Guard and U.S. Marshals, is this political posturing? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think that we have definitely seen local police departments unable or unwilling to help protect some of these statues from being vandalized, torn down. For example, the statue up in Wisconsin that was pulled down and beheaded and then thrown in the river was actually of an abolitionist who had given his life for the cause. So nobody did anything in that instance. And in that same thing -- it wasn't just a statue that got hurt. It was the very progressives -- progressive liberal state senator who got beat up. So if the local police are doing something, you know, let's see it. And I think that if I were to put myself back in Washington, D.C., I'd lived next to this park where the Lincoln Emancipation Statue is. And it was a gathering place where -- you would have school children coming by all the time, learning more about it, getting a sense of it. And I think that the National Guard protecting us in this moment is probably the best thing that we need if local law enforcement is not going to be willing to do it themselves. I don't think that the president is wrong to put this on Democratic cities in some cases. I do wish that these local leaders would accept the help, because we have a real problem here. And the president -- we're also in an election year. He's very good at attacking his opponents and putting them in a position where they have to align with whatever the problem is. So for example, the president, as you just saw in that clip, is saying I'm against the mobs. Therefore, Joe Biden is for the mobs. And so he's trying to put Biden in that position. And he has to defend the mob. And I go back to this point. If Joe Biden has an opportunity here to stand up and to push back on this and say there is a way to do changes, to statues lawfully with due process, you could vote. That's quite an American thing. We can vote on these things. But they don't want to do this because they're just in this fever of the mob. So I hope that tonight is calmer than advertised. We'll see. WILLIAMS: Greg, just picking up on what Dana was saying about, you know, Joe Biden has a way of turning his opponents to villains. He's tried with Joe Biden but Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton, obviously. And now as his poll numbers continue to fall, it looks like he's playing a lot of identity politics, going after people -- the anti-racist protesters, as losers and anarchists, and going after people -- (CROSSTALK) GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Is there a question in here, Juan or a statement? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I'm asking -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Is this a question? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: That wasn't a question. No, because -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: I don't believe anything you said. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: OK. Let me tell you. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: It's funny. WILLIAMS: Trump's numbers are falling. And he's playing identity politics. Will it work? GUTFELD: I -- again, dispute your premise. I don't believe he's playing identity politics. In fact, he doesn't have to. I sense that you are playing identity politics. But we won't go there. Look, Biden and the Democrats, they cannot be critical of anything about law and order if they have already abdicated their role in preserving it. They're not even trying to come out with a statement about this stuff. So when they talk about police reform, there's -- it's pointless, because they can't even step up and protect their own cities. You know, this is a very depressing time. But I'd lake to quote the philosopher, Cody Rigsby, and say, you know, even though things are bad, don't let the day snatch your wig. Because the bright side is when you look at these statue pullers, they're - - most of them are pasty out of shape white losers. This is not a revolution. It's a tantrum. That's why like Robert Johnson from BET when he said that blacks are actually laughing at these people. And taking statues is really kind of the lily whitest thing you can do. Oh, I'm so good to you people. Look, I'm taking down these statues in the name of black lives. It is actually a condescending, insulting act, a symbolic gesture, not a practical one. You're not helping with jobs or opportunity. You're just destroying things. WILLIAMS: So Jesse, just picking up on what Greg was saying. Bob Johnson, the founder of BET, though, he backed something like reparations. What do you think? JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Bob Johnson backs reparations? WILLIAMS: Right. WATTERS: Is that true? I didn't hear that. I heard him saying that white people tearing down statues is a joke. And then black people laugh at that. But listen, if he's for a reparation, that's fine. I'm not for reparations. He has a lot of money. I'm sure he donates a lot of that money to the black community and good for him. That's one way to solve this problem. You know, every question you've asked, Juan, has been kind of just false. I mean, to say that Trump's playing politics while he's telling people to knock off the looting and the arson is identity politics? To say hey, guys, stop shooting innocent people? I've -- like what are you talking about? These are Democrats who are destroying Democrat cities. Trump's offering to give them a hand. And you're attacking President Trump. I don't think Barack Obama would even allow this stuff. You think Barack Obama would let this stuff happen? No. He probably would try to clean it up, too. But Trump tries to clean it up, and he's the bad guy? I mean, where is Joe Biden? You know, he's running for president. He wants to be the leader of this country that's destroying itself. You'd think he would have an opinion on the hottest issue of the day. No one even knows what Joe Biden thinks of the statues coming down, or the looting or the arson. I mean, I don't know what it is. I just actually have been inundated with texts from my liberal family all day, and it's driving me crazy. You have to give up your white privilege. How do we renounce your white privilege, Jesse? You are not a black American. You don't know what it's like. You can only speak for white people. You can't speak for black people. OK, I went on the black lives matter website, because I wanted to find out a little bit more about they wanted. You know what blacks lives matter wants? This is their actual -- there's list of six things, an end to the war on black people, sounds good to me. I mean, if there's a war on black people, I renounce that. Reparations, I'm against that, so is the rest of the country. Invest, de-vest. I think that is about fossil fuels. Now, it's get a little weird. Economic justice, you look at some of that, all socialism. Community control, that doesn't make any sense. And then political power, everybody wants political power. So if you dig deeper, it's basically just reparations and socialism. WILLIAMS: OK. So Dagen, in New York City, the mayor there, Bill De Blasio, wants to troll the president. He wants to paint black lives matter right in front of Trump Tower. Are you laughing? Do you think this is funny? DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: I know that shootings in New York City have doubled in the first three weeks of June from a year ago. And there is complete lawlessness in the street. So he can do these little stunts. But at the end of the day, he's not protecting the people of New York City and he's not standing up for police officers. And that's what you see in these liberal blue cities, states. And even from the likes of Joe Biden. Either they endorse lawlessness or they tolerate it. And what ends up happening is rioters are allowed to rule. And vandals are allowed to destroy whatever they want. So it's not just about the statues coming down in the middle of the night. It's about which begets, well, then there's looting and there's more theft, and then there's assault and then there's rape and then there's murder. And that is the spiral that President Trump is actually trying to stand up against, because there's a very clear link between liberal law enforcement, lackluster law enforcement, and a stretch to violent crime. And just really quickly, it is these bastions of blueness in cities, states, and even in say, corporations. The most progressive corporations do the worst for black Americans. If you look at the breakdown of the number of people of black Americans who work at a Facebook -- let me throw this out there. Less than four percent of the employees at Facebook are black. And less than 1.5 percent are in technology jobs. That's the opportunity that Mr. Johnson is talking about. And they're not getting it from progressives and liberals. WILLIAMS: OK. Coming up, Republicans -- I'm sorry. OK, Republicans accuse Democrats of stalling police reform on purpose to try to make it a 2020 election issue, next on The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The death of yet another African-American man, George Floyd, his murder, is why the country has given us the opportunity to lead, to lead, as our friends on the other side just said no. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCDOWELL: Senator Tim Scott and Republicans tearing into Democrats for blocking their police reform bill. The GOP now saying Democrats did it so they can run on the issue in November. Over in the House, Nancy Pelosi is poised to pass her own version of police reform, setting the stage for a show down with Senate Republicans. It doesn't look like Nancy or her party are interested in compromise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not the time for half measures. It's not the time for further study. It's not the time for sham fake reform. The Senate bill is sham fake reform. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): When we pass this bill, the Senate will have a choice to honor George Floyd's life or to do nothing. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCDOWELL: Dana, offensive language, it keeps coming. PERINO: Yeah. I mean I -- Noah Rothman wrote a piece that I recommend to people. It's called Does Tim Scott's Pain Matter? If you have a time and you care about this issue, everyone should listen to his 30-minute floor speech that he gave without any written notes. He just gave it from the heart. He's been working on this issue for years. He took the exact language of bills that Gary Peters, the Democratic senator from Michigan, has been trying to pass for five years. He took direct language from Booker -- from Kamala Harris. He said I'll accept all amendments. But no, they didn't want to allow a vote to go forward so that they can debate a bill. Now, on the House side, the Democrats are going to pass a bill because they control the chamber there. Now, they want to have this fight with Republicans. And, you know, I think that unfortunately the way the media is and the way that the campaigns are going, the Republicans are going to have to figure out a way to really push back on this, because lot of the Senate races, the Republicans are on their heels, right? They're trying to figure out how can they win in this environment. They were willing to do this before the Fourth of July recess. They were thwarted. It is wrong. I think everybody wants to get this done now. My last thing I would point out is you remember bills sitting on Capitol Hill, the little cartoon. There's nothing to say that we couldn't still have a compromise. If the Republicans are willing to take up the Democrats' bill, maybe amend it there and take it to the floor. Maybe we can still get something done. That's my slightly hopeful note for the day. MCDOWELL: Juan, Tim Scott has worked on the issue, the senator on police reform for years and years and years. And the vote by the Democrats against consideration basically stopped it in its tracks. And it looks like they're trying to use the death of George Floyd for political gain and more power. WILLIAMS: I disagree, Dagen. I mean, police reform is very popular. It's close to 60 percent of Americans across several polls say they either favor some reform or a complete overhaul of police in the country. And when you look at the GOP bill, you know, let's look at what it has in it. No ban on the chokeholds, right, no end to the immunity for police -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: That's not fair. WILLIAMS: -- sued by civilians, right? And you have no ban on no-knock warrants, right? And even the registry of police misbehavior that they have put in their bill would not be open to the public, so the public can't do or know anything about bad cops. You know, a lot of this, to my mind, I just -- you know you look at that tape that came out of Wilmington, North Carolina where you have the police officers just talking, using the N word. Not only about people they're working with but with other cops and judges, or you look at the situation in Tucson where a young Latino man dies handcuffed in police custody. I think that's why people want police reform. MCDOWELL: Let me just clarify something. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Including Republicans. MCDOWELL: Right. That's the whole point. Let me just clarify some of the things in Tim Scott's bill very quickly, conditioned federal grants to jurisdictions that restrict chokeholds, addressing chokeholds. Addressing the no-knock warrants, trying to collect some data on the use of them, because we don't know how they're used or even how often. Directs the Justice Department to develop a program to train officers on how to deescalate confrontations and respond to suspects with mental illnesses, because those result in more than 25 percent of fatal police shootings. I could go on. But there's 70 percent compromise in this bill, Jesse. And it's going nowhere, because the Democrats want this as a political win and nothing more. And they're doing it with blood on their hands. WATTERS: Well, here's the scam that Juan and the Democrats are perpetrating. You don't need Congress to do it. Juan, why doesn't a Democrat mayor just do it? How about the mayor of Atlanta? They don't need Congress. How about the mayor of Milwaukee, San Francisco? How about Nancy Pelosi calls her friend in San Francisco and says, hey, let's ban chokeholds? Chokeholds banned. You don't have to do it in Congress. That's the scam. They want to just drag this out and make Republicans look like they're not playing ball. But they are playing ball. The Democrats don't want to actually do anything, because here's the little secret. The Democrats that run these cities, where all of this violence is, they actually need tough policing. Because if there's not tough policing -- and I'm not talking about brutality. I'm talking about strict, strong police work. If it's not there, cities go crazy. There's violence. There's crime waves, and then those Democrat mayors, they don't get re-elected. The donations don't flow and businesses leave. So they need to keep things under control. So that's why they're not going to do a damn thing about it. They're going to keep it the way it is. But the sad part is the way they politicized this and demonized police. The police are going to hang back and they're going to let the crime run wild. And if you want to put a little registry up, let's put a registry up of all the bad teachers, all the teachers in these unions that molest kids and do drugs and stuff like that. Put their names in a national registry for everybody to say, all right? Because you think it's really smart to put a cop's identity and all of his personal information on a website so everybody can see who he is, where he is, what is he about? You don't think that puts a target on that cop's back? You don't need the entire country to see the registry. Come on. MCDOWELL: Greg? GUTFELD: The interesting thing about the registry is they really don't want it, because the moment that you actually have the statistics and the facts, it's going to undermine the narrative. You're going to see that the error rate is much smaller than what the media has been telling us. So what you're seeing are tactics of the modern regressive left. What they do, is -- it's steeped into the mainstream Democratic Party, where now debate is not feasible, because you do not debate people that you believe are evil. That's the modern regressive left. And now, it's becoming the voice of the Democratic Party. But as this wears on and on and on, you know who is starting to look better and better? The police, they're actually looking better than their critics on the street and their critics in government. One group on the street are creating havoc, burning things, destroying things, beating up people. Then you have the ones in government who are determined to block actual legislation. So when this is all over, the police suddenly become way more sympathetic. And we may learn a lot more about how efficient they are because of their own inefficiencies of their critics. MCDOWELL: Indeed, here, here, here, up next, hypocrite Governor Andy Cuomo now lashing out at red states over a rise in virus cases. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: America hitting a single day high for new Coronavirus cases, Texas, Florida, and California among the states with the biggest spikes. And New York's Governor, Andrew Cuomo, thinks now is the perfect time to play politics and attack red states despite his own failures stopping the virus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I say to them all, look at the numbers. You played politics with this virus and you lost. Now, you see 27 states with the numbers going up. You see the death projections going up. You see the economy going down. It was never politics. It was always science. And they were in denial. And denial is not a life strategy. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right, Greg, don't -- let's not play politics, but I'm going to play politics and blame everybody else except myself, right? GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, I think they got -- they've got to get over this tit for tat thing because, frankly, everybody at one point during this whole thing was wrong, including the experts. New York isn't doing that great. It ranks what, 48 out of 50 in survival rates. So it should be a little bit more humble, especially after the nursing home thing. But a lot of people made mistakes. We also know and we have to -- we have to be optimistic. We got to look at the death count, and I think the death count is like United States overall is down 80 percent. If I you can fact check me out, but I'm pretty sure. But we knew, we knew cases would rise as young people started going out again, that summer interaction, people still have to be safe, you got to wear your masks. You got to take the precautions with distance and do that. But I am -- I believe that -- I'm turning myself into a slim, gorgeous stimulus package. I need to go out into the community and spend the money that I haven't spent and put it back in there and get the economy back on its feet. I'll be wearing a mask. I'll be six feet away. But I'm going out there because it's time. We all have to be stimulus packages. I just happen to be a very sexy one. PERINO: Yes. WATTERS: God, Greg Gutfeld, the slim, sexy stimulus package. And tan, I might add. All right, Dana, what do you think about Cuomo patting himself on the back? I mean, they had a tough time in New York. I don't know if now's the time for congratulations. PERINO: Well, you know, if you're surrounded by a media that tells you you're so awesome, you're maybe going to believe it. The other day I watched CBS Sunday morning, which is a show that I love. I've loved it my whole life. And I watched the interview that Jane Pauley did with the governor and she never even asked him about the nursing home policy. And it was all about how he's this amazing bachelor who lives up in this mansion, and maybe he should like date somebody. It was -- it's shocking. And maybe for punishment, I'll make Greg watch it so we can do another monologue about the media. It's really unbelievable. I will also say this, though. I had the mayor of Miami on the daily briefing yesterday and he said he understands Governor Cuomo's position about having people from Florida quarantined. He said, he's not going to quibble with that. They really want to do the right thing and make sure that people are safe. So there are some people who aren't playing politics. WATTERS: Juan Williams, obviously, as Greg mentioned at the top, there's going to be more cases, we were told to expect more cases as we flatten the curve. Do you see, in your opinion, a second wave on the horizon potentially, or do you see this as just what we heard was going to happen? WILLIAMS: Well, I think you told me you don't believe in the second wave, right, Jesse? So I don't know. I just listen to people like-- WATTERS: I said I want predicting a second wave. WATTERS: Right. So I just listened to Fauci, I listened to the CDC director, and they say we're still in the first wave. And you know, the surprise to me is that I thought a lot of this would die down during the summer months. In any case, with regard to Cuomo, I just think he's not so much playing politics as the tables have turned. It used to be that New York was in dire shape. And now the big spikes are elsewhere in the country, especially in the south and the Southwest. And, you know, he's just saying to them, it's -- you know, those people were telling New Yorkers they couldn't come to their state. And now the tables have turned and he wants -- Cuomo wants to protect New Yorkers from experiencing another wave of this virus. And I would just add that Senator Cornyn of Texas, is urging President Trump not to withdraw money for testing because he sees what's going on in Texas. WATTERS: Yes. I mean, I think the difference is you're not seeing a spike in deaths in the other states like you saw the spike in deaths in New York State. All right, Dagen McDowell, what do you think? MCDOWELL: Before any more bragging from Governor Cuomo, how about taking responsibility for the thousands of elderly people in nursing homes who died because of your executive order? Florida, by the way, had 5,000 fewer deaths in nursing homes because they ban covet positive patients from going into said nursing homes. I watched the Cuomo bro show last night and here's what the governor said. There's no doubt we have to figure out how to do it better next time, talking about the nursing homes. Oh, you mean not killing people by fiat, by a decree from the governor's mansion. I would use the word asshat here but that will be an insult to hats and actual asses. WATTERS: Wow, I feel like I'm on the \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW.\" This is a good experience. All right, ahead, Democrats are happy to keep Biden in the bunker, but how long can that strategy last? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Democrats are (AUDIO GAP) Biden's bunker strategy and (AUDIO GAP) paying off. The former vice president leading President Trump in several key states according to a new poll. Biden did travel to Pennsylvania today, but does he need to get out in public more? Juan, what do you think? WILLIAMS: Well, as you said, he's in Pennsylvania today talking healthcare, Dana. I think he was in Houston for the Floyd family during that funeral. But as you say, if it isn't broke, why fix it? You stop and think about it by political metrics, he's up in the polls. In the month of May, he raised more money than President Trump. Even a good Republican like Carly Fiorina says she's going to vote for Biden. So, you know, at this point, you just -- if it isn't broke, why fix it? PERINO: But what about muscle memory, Jesse? You know, getting out there and being nimble, because the things that might matter the most in the campaign are the three debates that are taking place this fall. WATTERS: I'm so glad one thinks everything's working perfectly. I'm so glad that the Democratic Party thinks this is going well, because here's the deal. I was just as nervous when I'm looking at these poll numbers. I said, is Trump really losing that badly? I mean, how could this be? Look at these numbers? So, I called the best poll guy in the business and you know what he tells me, this is how they frame the Biden lead, OK? They don't poll likely voters; they pull adults and registered voters. Those people all don't vote, and they're not going to vote. So that automatically takes away tens of millions of potential Trump voters. Then what they do is they screw up the sample size. So, the election polls 2016 had party affiliation 33 percent Republican. But when they do the sample in these polls, it's like 23 percent Republican. So, they take out 10 percent of the Republican affiliation just right there alone. Then what they do is that they load up the poll with a racial questionnaire. So, they take this poll in the heat of this racial unrest, and every single questions based on race and George Floyd, so that's how you get that skewed to, all right. So, think about what happened in 2016. Hillary Clinton was ahead. She was - - a week before, she was ahead by 13, and then she was ahead in every single swing state. And then what happened? Trump beat her in every single swing state. So, the same thing is happening that happened last time. And you know what, I want the Democrats to believe the poll numbers. I love it. keep believing it. PERINO: Well, that there is a risk, Greg, of course that the Democrat -- for the Democrats, there's a risk that they take some comfort in this and they get overconfident. I do think that debates are really going to matter, do you? GUTFELD: Well, here's the deal. I don't -- I believe there may not be any debates because of what Juan -- what Juan is saying is that they just want to keep them in the little cage like a parrot. This -- Joe is really a breakthrough candidate when you think about it. You know, Obama was first black president, you had Hillary was the first woman nominee, Trump the first celebrity president. Joe Biden is the first stay at home candidate. You know, he's blazing a trail for really lazy agoraphobics, you know, who want to be president. I mean, I could actually run for mayor of New York from a cabin in the woods. You know, I -- how do we know that he's even real? He might be a hologram because, you know, we checked, because sometimes when he makes those vocal screw-ups, it feels like a technical glitch you know, like he's a projection and something kind of skips. Having said that, I mean I've been pretty up for a virtual president. It'd be pretty cool. Not even real, a simulation. PERINO: It might save us some money, Dagen. What do you think? I'll give you the last word. MCDOWELL: Continued cocooning might work for Joe Biden or it could highlight his agedness and his potentially weak constitution. I think President Trump and Joe Biden both need to take a driving test in front of the American people. They're both septuagenarians. We should at least know if you know how to handle an automobile. PERINO: Yes, but they both have Secret Service protection so they don't need to drive. MCDOWELL: But you know -- but all older people -- all older people need to drive. PERINO: But I want to see them parallel park. MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. PERINO: I want to see the parallel parking. I want to see it. All right, more of THE FIVE coming right up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Welcome back. So male cat owners, they do exist, are more likely to be lonely. A new study shows men who post photos of themselves holding cats on their dating profiles are less likely to get a match. All right, Dagen, if you saw a guy holding a cat, it's rare, that's why it's weird. I think it's weird because it's rare. It's like when you -- it's like Paul Krugman, he has a cat and he's weird. That's my theory. MCDOWELL: I am not saying anything negative about cat owners because they will come for you and destroy your life. But I will -- GUTFELD: Yes, they will. MCDOWELL: I will add like on the internet, they'll find out where you live. But I will add that when I see a dude in a dating profile holding a cat, I would just assume he just broke up with his girlfriend or his partner and got left with the cat. GUTFELD: See, I don't buy -- and from personal experience, Dana, and you know, because you were on \"RED EYE,\" Andy Levy had two cats, Pixel and Stormy, and he was quite attractive to the ladies. He had no problems. I think he used the cats to suck them in. PERINO: Yes, I don't -- I don't think Andy what is on the dating profiles. I'm assuming that if men post themselves with cats in a dating profile that they prefer to be alone. That's what I'm assuming. That's a signal. GUTFELD: Oh, wow. Interesting. I happen to like cats. PERINO: They're just fulfilling something that their mom wishes they would do. GUTFELD: Wow. Juan, come on, say something nice. I like cats. You like cats? WILLIAMS: I don't have any problem. But you know, after 42 years of marriage, Greg, I'm not in anybody's dating profile. But I'm a dog guy and all my kids have dogs. But actually, two of them also, now that I think about it have cats as well. It's like a zoo crew over here. I'm telling you that. GUTFELD: Yes. Jesse, cats, dating, go. WATTERS: All right, America, I'm going to tell you guys how to date women. All right, you guys want to hear how to pick up women? GUTFELD: No, don't. WATTERS: Dana, hold my hand. OK, producer, no? OK, I won't do it. I won't do it. But here's what I will say. Here's what I will say. I think I understand why women don't like the guy with the cat. Because the guy with the cat, it's not hard to take care of a cat. Taking care of a dog is a bigger responsibility. You have to walk it, you have to -- it's a lot of stuff. So women see more of like a nurturing kind of person like that as opposed to a cat. What do you like, refill the litter box once every two weeks? That's nothing. PERINO: Once every two weeks? GUTFELD: Yes, I did that for myself. WATTERS: Maybe more. GUTFELD: In New York, a litter box is considered a bathroom, by the way. You know, you could put it when you're renting your apartment. You could say one and a half baths, if you have a litter box. All right, \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Oh, fun. It's time for \"ONE MORE THING.\" I'm going to kick it off. Three, two, one, blast off. NASA rocketed into new territory yesterday when it announced it will name the headquarters building after Mary W. Jackson. You may know Miss Jackson. She's one of the women celebrated in the book and movie Hidden Figures. Here she is being portrayed by actress Janelle Monae. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I plan on being an engineer NASA, but I can do that without taking them classes at all-white high school. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: The mathematician and engineer started her career in a racially segregated computing division at NASA's Langley Research Center. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine credited her with being one of the people who helped NASA get Americans into space. Miss Jackson ended her career as an equal opportunity specialist for NASA, bringing more women and minorities into the space agency. Jesse? WATTERS: OK, remember when Gutfeld took the day off a couple of days ago? Everybody was wondering where is Gutfeld? Well, we had some cameras following him. He got busted watch. There he is, just a little rollerblading on the weekends. This is how he blows off steam. If he gets frustrated with Juan, little rollerblading feels better the next day. GUTFELD: Yes, you're right. It's my favorite wig too. That's my favorite wig. MCDOWELL: Your Captain Kangaroo wig. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Dana, you're up. PERINO: Greg, Cody would be very impressed with that wig indeed. I want to introduce you to a dog. That is all smiles. This is Milo. He's an eight- month-old cockapoo. Look at that smile. No, that's not his real teeth. So he comes from Wales and you know an eight-month-old, he's a little mischievous. He broke into the bathroom drawer to get the dentures and was quite proud of himself, has this big toothy grin as it goes all over. An interesting fact, dogs actually always want to get your retainers or your dentures or anything you've ever had in your mouth so you might want to lock up your dentures, people. WATTERS: Interesting fact. WILLIAMS: Gregory? GUTFELD: And I'm sure the guy, when he got it, he put it right back in his mouth because you know, who cares, right? PERINO: No problem. GUTFELD: Let's do this. Greg's Amazing Plugs. All right, I just did a great podcast. It's truly amazing. It's with Riley Gale. He's the lead singer of the amazing band Power Trip. I know you love thrash metal like I do. And this is the best band. We talked about COVID, how COVID is affecting bands, the music scene. And we also go into Dana's favorite topic, which is psychedelic drugs. Then you can -- you can listen to it at radio.foxnews.com. And I also tweeted it so you could see it on my Twitter feed. WILLIAMS: Greg, why are you such -- Greg, why are you such -- Greg, why are you such a heavy metal fan? GUTFELD: I think I just like all kinds of music. I listen to everything, but metal just gets my blood pumping, you know. And I like to fashion. I'm wearing a leather thong. WILLIAMS: All right, Dagen, you're up. MCDOWELL: So, sometimes security footage catches something well, really wicked awesome. And take a look at this. This is Dallas Cowboys' safety. Haha Clinton-Dix. Hello, couple of bears hanging out. Let's show it again. He's riding around his house on a little standing scooter. He's extremely fast. This was down in his home in Florida. He dropped the scooter, ran the other way. But I wonder if it's just a visit from some fans from his former team. Go Bears. PERINO: The Bears. That's cute. MCDOWELL: Go Bears. GUTFELD: Terrible. Terrible. WILLIAMS: You know, he got off that thing without falling. That was pretty good. MCDOWELL: And he's the one who shared it. PERINO: Who was more scared, him or the bears? I think the bears was more kind of scared. WILLIAMS: Yes, I think he was pretty athletic. MCDOWELL: No, it was a mama bear with the cub. Mama bear with a cub is very dangerous. WATTERS: Greg, the book, I thought you were going to plug your book in the books plugs thing. You're not going to plug the book? Don't you have a book out? GUTFELD: Well, you know, The Plus is like number -- The Plus is number one on Amazon's like self-help or at least it was last time I checked. So go to -- buy that book. WILLIAMS: All right.

The President of the Portland Police Association on Monday took both rioters and elected officials to task for \u201cdemonizing\u201d officers who are on the front lines dealing with riots. In an open letter published Monday, Daryl Turner slammed the rioters for drawing \u201cattention away from an important message about social and racial equity that needs to be heard.\u201d Daryl Turner, President of the Portland Police Association.\u00a0 (Portland Police Association) Turner\u2019s letter comes after a week of escalating riots in and around downtown Portland. The riots stemmed from peaceful protests against racial injustice sparked by the police custody death of George Floyd in late May but have descended into property damage, fires, and injured officers. Turner, who is Black, said the rioters\u2019 \u201cdestructive and chaotic behavior\u201d defined the meaning of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and that \u201ctheir total disregard for people, property, and the law embodies entitlement.\u201d Turner likewise criticized elected officials who are \u201cdefending these criminal actions while in the same breathe demonizing and vilifying the officers on the front lines protecting our communities, our safety, our livelihood, and our rights.\u201d \u201cThis cannot continue. Our elected officials owe it to all of Portland to do their jobs. Do not widen the divide between police and our communities, close it,\u201d Turner said. \u201cDo not allow the meaningful dialogue and protests about racial and social equity to be drowned out by the sound of rioting and violence. NYPD TOP COP PEGS UPTICK IN RECENT VIOLENCE TO RIKERS INMATES RELEASED Turner\u2019s statement won support from former state Sen.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cThe behavior we\u2019re witnessing is an example of white privilege co-opting the Black Lives Matter movement, and I\u2019m concerned that the elected officials really need to pay attention to what Daryl Turner is saying.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at night four of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. As prepared for delivery. Good evening.Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom: Give people light and they will find a way.Give people light.Those are words for our time.The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst. I will be an ally of the light not of the darkness.\u00a0It's time for us, for We the People, to come together.For make no mistake. United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.I am a proud Democrat and I will be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So, it is with great honor and humility that I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.But while I will be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn't support me as I will for those who did.That's the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment.It's a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.\u00a0America isn't just a collection of clashing interests of Red States or Blue States.We're so much bigger than that.\u00a0We're so much better than that.Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty, and fear.\u00a0Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well.And he did.And so can we.This campaign isn't just about winning votes.\u00a0It's about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America.\u00a0Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish. Winning it for the workers who keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of the \"knee on the neck\".\u00a0 For all the young people who have known only an America of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity.\u00a0They deserve to experience America's promise in full.No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we'll be ready when that moment arrives.And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced.Four historic crises. All at the same time. A perfect storm.The worst pandemic in over 100 years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.The most compelling call for racial justice since the 60's. And the undeniable realities and accelerating threats of climate change.So, the question for us is simple: Are we ready?I believe we are.\u00a0We must be.\u00a0All elections are important. But we know in our bones this one is more consequential.\u00a0America is at an inflection point. A time of real peril, but of extraordinary possibilities.We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.A path of shadow and suspicion.Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.This is a life-changing election that will determine America's future for a very long time.Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy.They are all on the ballot.Who we are as a nation. What we stand for. And, most importantly, who we want to be.That\u2019s all on the ballot.\u00a0And the choice could not be clearer.No rhetoric is needed.Just judge this president on the facts.5 million Americans infected with COVID-19.More than 170,000 Americans have died.By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth.More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year.Nearly one in 6 small businesses have closed this year.If this president is re-elected we know what will happen.Cases and deaths will remain far too high.\u00a0More mom and pop businesses will close their doors for good.\u00a0Working families will struggle to get by, and yet, the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks.And the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until its destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people \u2013 including more than 15 million people on Medicaid \u2013 and getting rid of the protections that President Obama and I passed for people who suffer from a pre-existing condition.And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for 8 years as Vice President. Let me take this moment to say something we don't say nearly enough.Thank you, Mr. President. You were a great president. A president our children could \u2013\u00a0and did \u2013 look up to.No one will say that about the current occupant of the office.\u00a0What we know about this president is if he's given four more years he will be what he's been the last four years.A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division.He will wake up every day believing the job is all about him. Never about you.Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children?\u00a0I see a different America.One that is generous and strong.\u00a0Selfless and humble.\u00a0It\u2019s an America we can rebuild together.As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.\u00a0Because I understand something this president doesn't.\u00a0We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back to school, we will never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus.The tragedy of where we are today is it didn't have to be this bad.\u00a0Just look around.\u00a0It's not this bad in Canada. Or Europe. Or Japan. Or almost anywhere else in the world.The President keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him, no miracle is coming.We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths.Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American communities bearing the brunt of it.And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan.Well, I do.\u00a0If I'm president on day one we'll implement the national strategy I've been laying out since March.\u00a0We'll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.We'll make the medical supplies and protective equipment our country needs. And we'll make them here in America. So we will never again be at the mercy of China and other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.We'll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective.\u00a0We'll put the politics aside and take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve. The honest, unvarnished truth. They can deal with that.\u00a0We'll have a national mandate to wear a mask-not as a burden, but to protect each other.It's a patriotic duty.In short, I will do what we should have done from the very beginning.\u00a0Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation.\u00a0He failed to protect us.He failed to protect America.And, my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.\u00a0As president, I will make you this promise: I will protect America. I will defend us from every attack. Seen. And unseen. Always. Without exception. Every time.Look, I understand it's hard to have hope right now.\u00a0On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most.I know how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes.\u00a0But I've learned two things.\u00a0First, your loved ones may have left this Earth but they never leave your heart.\u00a0 They will always be with you.\u00a0And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.\u00a0As God's children each of us have a purpose in our lives.\u00a0And we have a great purpose as a nation: To open the doors of opportunity to all Americans. To save our democracy. To be a light to the world once again.To finally live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man.He got knocked down a few times pretty hard, but always got up.He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, \"Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect it to understand them.\"And then he would say: \"Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in your community. It\u2019s about looking your kids in the eye and say, honey, it\u2019s going to be okay.\"I've never forgotten those lessons.\u00a0That's why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community.\u00a0 Together, we can, and we will, rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back, we'll build it back better.With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth. With pipes that transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America.\u00a0With a health care system that lowers premiums, deductibles, and drug prices by building on the Affordable Care Act he\u2019s trying to rip away.With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century, where cost doesn't prevent young people from going to college, and student debt doesn't crush them when they get out.\u00a0With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.We can, and we will, deal with climate change. It's not only a crisis, it's an enormous opportunity. An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process.And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes and the president's $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which pay no tax at all.Because we don't need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I'm not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.\u00a0For our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He's proposing to eliminate the tax that pays for almost half of Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue.I will not let it happen. If I'm your president, we're going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have my word.One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They're speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice.\u00a0I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it's the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job \u2014 it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone.\u00a0I won't have to do it alone. Because I will have a great Vice President at my side. Senator Kamala Harris. She is a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left-out and left-behind.\u00a0\u00a0But she's overcome every obstacle she's ever faced. No one's been tougher on the big banks or the gun lobby. No one's been tougher in calling out this current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, and its failure to simply tell the truth.Kamala and I both draw strength from our families. For Kamala, it\u2019s Doug and their families.For me, it\u2019s Jill and ours.\u00a0No man deserves one great love in his life. But I've known two. After losing my first wife in a car accident, Jill came into my life and put our family back together.\u00a0She's an educator. A mom. A military Mom. And an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. Because she's going to get it done. She was a great Second Lady and she will make a great First Lady for this nation, she loves this country so much.\u00a0And I will have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley and all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister. They give me courage and lift me up.\u00a0And while he is no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day.\u00a0Beau served our nation in uniform. A decorated Iraq war veteran.So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as Commander in Chief.I will be a president who will stand with our allies and friends. I will make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators are over.\u00a0Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise \u2013 voting.I will stand always for our values of human rights and dignity. And I will work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world.History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character?I believe we're up to it.I believe we're ready.Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville.Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches?\u00a0 Veins bulging? Spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s?Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it?\u00a0\u00a0Remember what the president said?\u00a0There were quote, \"very fine people on both sides.\"It was a wake-up call for us as a country.And for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew I\u2019d have to run. My father taught us that silence was complicity. And I could not remain silent or complicit.At the time, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.\u00a0And we are.One of the most important conversations I've had this entire campaign is with someone who is too young to vote.I met with six-year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her Daddy George Floyd was laid to rest.She is incredibly brave.\u00a0I\u2019ll never forget.When I leaned down to speak with her, she looked into my eyes and said \"Daddy, changed the world.\"Her words burrowed deep into my heart.Maybe George Floyd's murder was the breaking point.Maybe John Lewis' passing the inspiration.However it has come to be, America is ready to in John's words, to lay down \"the heavy burdens of hate at last\" and to do the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.America's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress. That we've found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more.I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities.\u00a0That in America, everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there is only one way forward. As a united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright.\u00a0Are we ready?I believe we are.\u00a0This is a great nation.\u00a0And we are a good and decent people.This is the United States of America.\u00a0And there has never been anything we\u2019ve been unable to accomplish when we've done it together.The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote:\"History says,Don't hope on this side of the grave,But then, once in a lifetimeThe longed-for tidal waveOf justice can rise up,And hope and history rhyme\"This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme.\u00a0With passion and purpose, let us begin \u2013 you and I together, one nation, under God \u2013\u00a0united in our love for America and united in our love for each other.\u00a0For love is more powerful than hate.\u00a0Hope is more powerful than fear.\u00a0Light is more powerful than dark.\u00a0\u00a0This is our moment.This is our mission.\u00a0May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light joined in the battle for the soul of the nation.And this is a battle that we, together, will win.\u00a0I promise you.Thank you.And may God bless you.And may God protect our troops.",

I have no problem talking to people from the other side but I just have to feel like that\u2019s really your truth. I don\u2019t know if I got that from Rush, it felt like more of a performance,\u201d Charlamagne said Wednesday on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d during a wide-ranging conversation on race relations. MSNBC HOST RACHEL MADDOW'S RATINGS SLIDE CONTINUES DESPITE UNPRECEDENTED NEWS CYCLE Colbert said he felt the same way when he interviewed President Trump. \u201cIt felt like a performance,\u201d Colbert said. Charlamagne then said he heard Limbaugh educate viewers on white supremacy following Monday\u2019s interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d so he wasn\u2019t sure why Limbaugh downplayed it during their discussion. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel productive, it felt like a waste of my time,\u201d Charlamagne said. Earlier in the interview, Charlamagne told Colbert that America is \u201ca private club founded by old rich white men, for rich white men,\u201d and we\u2019re all caught up in a \u201cweb of white supremacy.\u201d RUSH LIMBAUGH, CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD SPAR OVER WHITE PRIVILEGE DURING 'BREAKFAST CLUB' CONVERSATION: 'YOU'RE BEING DELUSIONAL' On Monday, \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d a New York City-based morning radio program that has been an essential landing spot for prominent Democrats, linked up with Limbaugh for a special conversation about the recent events that have unfolded in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in police custody. The outspoken personalities found common ground on the death of Floyd being an unnecessary tragedy, but sparred over white privilege. At one point after Limbaugh noted the success of The Breakfast Club, Charlamagne Tha God said America \u201cdenies black people justice and just plain decency\u201d but black people have been expected to act like they\u2019re \u201chappy to be here\u201d because a few of them, like him, could be well-off.

            "article_content": "New York Times opinion columnist and editor Bari Weiss announced her resignation on Tuesday, saying she was bullied by colleagues; reaction from Robby Soave, author of 'Panic Attack.' This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" July 14, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST HOST: Good evening, and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" I'm Brian Kilmeade, and as you probably figured out, I'll be filling in for Tucker and in just a few minutes, Tucker will be joining us here on his very own show. You could add at least three new names to the roster of people recently forced out by the social justice mob. This afternoon, get this, Andrew Sullivan, a writer at \"New York Magazine,\" longtime critic of the cancel culture announced that he was leaving his job. Last night, San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art canceled one of his top curators after he suggested that the museum might continue to feature works by white artists. I know, hold on to somebody. This morning, New York Times\u00a0opinion writer, Bari Weiss left the paper after three years on the job. Take note that none of these people are partisan Republicans at all. Together, they join an ever expanding list of toppled statues, defaced monuments and canceled careers. You can be sure that more people will lose their jobs, maybe by tomorrow. It's the moment we live in. But today, some of the people who were canceled are starting to fight back. Consider the case of Bari Weiss. She announced her resignation in a scathing letter that accuses The Times\u00a0of being controlled by the mob. Quote, \"Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times\u00a0but Twitter has become its ultimate editor.\" An obvious reference to the leftwing agitators who dominate the website. She continued, \"A new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper that truth isn't a process of collecting discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few, whose job it is to inform everybody else.\" That's from her. The letter goes on. She explained that intellectual curiosity and risk taking have become liabilities at The New York Times,\u00a0which is why the paper refuses to run stories that challenge the emerging woke orthodoxy. Free thinkers, to the extent they exist at the paper are too afraid to express their opinions. They remain quiet, afraid of the backlash and bullying that an independent thought might provoke. Now, Weiss isn't some sort of Trump-loving conservative with controversial views. She is an urban moderate, who openly sobbed at her desk when Trump was elected. Yes, Weiss is a run of the mill columnist. In normal times, she wouldn't be considered notable at all. As she says, herself, \"Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery.\" That's how she's been described, though, and yet, it does. Weiss has paid a big price for that. So what exactly did Bari Weiss do to provoke the anger of her colleagues at The New York Times? Well, one thing she did is criticize cancel culture, for example. BARI WEISS, FORMER COLUMNIST AT THE NEW YORK TIMES: I think that one thing that's overlooked in this -- when we talk about cancel culture, right, and the social ostracism and the actual firings that can happen when you break with one or another orthodoxy is that the people who are inoculated from it are people that are already extremely successful and can take the risk. It's why Ricky Gervais can be Ricky Gervais. It's why JK Rowling can tweet what she tweeted a few months ago and survive it because they've already accumulated enough capital. The people that I hear from that are completely screwed by it are people like artists and poets and untenured professors who aren't famous and no one knows about and are having to go with a begging bowl on Patreon or Venmo or whatever, to get support after they've made a bad joke or whatever it is. KILMEADE: So you didn't get her views, you just got her analysis of what we're all going through. In the end, Weiss proved she is not important enough or successful enough to overcome that mob. Now, she's gone, but not without a few additional parting shots at her former colleagues. In her resignation letter, she described them as out of touch. She says, they failed to learn essential lessons from the 2016 election, \" ... lessons about the importance of understanding other Americans, the necessity of resisting tribalism and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society. Those things have not been learned.\" That might sound very familiar because it's exactly what \"The New York Times\" former public editor, Liz Spayd said to Tucker in December of 2016. Remember this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ SPAYD, FORMER PUBLIC EDITOR, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I consider it almost an unrecognized point of view that that The Times\u00a0has that comes from being in New York, being in, you know, in a certain circle and seeing the world a certain way, not being in touch with people who don't live like them or don't live in cities and who are the ones that elected like Donald Trump for the presidency. They're just out of touch with that. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: You know, not long after that, you may remember Spayd lost her job. It wasn't evident at the time, but she was one of the first to illustrate the power of the mob and the control that shadow editors at Twitter have over \"The New York Times.\" I don't get why. Robby Soave is an author of \"Panic Attack,\" and has been covering the mob for years as a senior editor at \"Reason\" magazine. Robby joins us now. How significant is this -- the letter and the move by her, by Bari Weiss? ROBBY SOAVE, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REASON: I think it's very significant. It's been a crazy couple of weeks. The drama at a number of newsrooms, including and especially The New York Times,\u00a0remember this is coming shortly after they got rid of their opinion editor, James Bennett, who is also someone interested in cultivating or engaging ideas outside the progressive liberal bubble that has so consumed The New York Times. What's happening is that the most significant people associated with that effort to broaden the perspective, again, not to just change like what \"The New York Times\" thinks, but just to consider what other people in this country might think, those people are being rooted out or they just can't work there because it's such a miserable climate because of what the other employees, some small minority of very angry woke progressives are subjecting them to harassment and bullying and gossip, and name calling that's just made it a toxic environment for anyone who disagrees with them. KILMEADE: Robby, it was interesting, it's not a good business decision. It's not a good business decision to tell a group of people that might think a different way not to buy your newspaper, and I'm not talking about the opinion section. You could see their opinion in the way they cover stories. Andrew Sullivan writes today who quit also, the underlying reasons are self-evident why he quit. He looked back at her situation and she's a friend of his -- the mob bullied and harassed a young woman for thought crimes, and her editor stood by and watched. Where's the woke culture there? SOAVE: That's what's so amazing because again, this is -- it's really a small number of people who have that extremely far left viewpoint, even within The New York Times,\u00a0it's not probably most of the people work there. So you're alienating such a large section of people. You would think the bosses, the editors, the top guys would want to say, no, this is the wrong way for us to go. But instead, they're afraid that they'll be accused of being racist or sexist, or whatever it is, unless they let the mob kind of get away with whatever they want, unless they let them shout down and chase out people who dissent. And I mean, this is a terrible consequence for the New York Times. It's a terrible consequence for just being able to have, you know, discussions about different ideas. Again, Bari wasn't even -- she's not a Trump supporter. She's not a conservative. She has views that probably many people in America would share and many people in America share Trumpian and conservative views, too. There's no way they'll be able to air those in The New York Times\u00a0if Bari Weiss can't share what she thinks. KILMEADE: Robby, you told our producers that Nikole Hannah-Jones, the author of the 1619 Project. She's more with the editors of The New York Times\u00a0want or Twitter, who the editors of The New York Times\u00a0want. Why? SOAVE: Right. I mean, it's certainly the case. Jones is gaining prominence as voices like Bari's are being kind of quieted. You know, Jones is the author of this Pulitzer Prize winning effort. It's an esteemed effort to recast the founding of America as about the Declaration of Independence, as fundamentally about enshrining white supremacy. She's been criticized for this view by a number of historians, mainstream historians, and she's kind of really shrugged off the criticism or indeed kind of attacked people who criticize her. But she is the one who is -- she was on TV. I think she went on CNN talking about what's going on at The Times.\u00a0She speaks for the woke left, and her view is that it should fall in line with what she thinks, not be a space for views that disagree. That's my reading of the things she says about what she wants the New York Times to be. KILMEADE: And you know, the San Francisco curator that was fired because 200 former employees wrote a letter. You know what this this guy had the audacity to do this, Gary Garrels, he says we should continue to take work from white people, too. Really? No kidding. That's a problem? SOAVE: I wrote about this today at Reason.com. Yes, it's totally insane. They said that him saying that was an example of white supremacy. Can you imagine? First of all accusing an art curator in San Francisco of being a white supremacist? I doubt there are many in the field. But this was a perfectly benign statement, you know, 90 percent of people - - I bet a clear majority of Democrats would have heard what he said even and said, that's totally fine. So again, we're not talking about a large movement, we're talking about a small number of very angry kind of crazy people who are getting their way because people let them and yes, he resigned without so much as a fight after this petition to get rid of him. Just like that. People with totally mundane views are being canceled before our eyes. KILMEADE: Robby, always great to talk to you. Thanks for kicking up the show. Appreciate it. SOAVE: Thank you. KILMEADE: All right, let's kind of stay in the same genre. No place is guiltier of excessive self-righteousness than Hollywood, when we actually had Hollywood, but even some celebrities are tired of the never ending moral preening. Here's comedian just referenced before, Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes in January. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICKY GERVAIS, COMEDIAN: If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech, all right? You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Come up. Accept your little award. Thank you agent and your God and [bleep] off. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Still funny -- to everyone except for the people in the audience. A few days ago, Gervais doubled down in support of free speech without the laughter. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GERVAIS: There's this new weird sort of fascism of people thinking they know what you can say and what you can't. And it's a really weird thing that there's this new trendy myth that people who want free speech, wanting to say awful things all the time. This just isn't true. It protects everyone.\" (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KILMEADE: And Gervais is so good and so successful, he is impervious to the mob. But he's not alone in his thoughts. Film director Oliver Stone told The New York Times\u00a0Magazine yesterday, quote, \"Everything has become so fragile, too sensitive. Hollywood now, well, you can't make a film without a COVID adviser. You can't make a film without a sensitivity adviser. It's ridiculous. Will any of that make a difference? He asks. Dean Cain has been in Hollywood a long time, and I took down some of your credits, Dean. You have 177 movies. You've produced 16. You've written on four. You've directed at least two the last time I tallied. So you've seen a lot of movie sets, a lot of TV sets. Have things changed? DEAN CAIN, ACTOR AND PRODUCER: Well, you know what, we haven't gone back to work yet. But things have been changing for a long time. If you look at the films that have been made in the past that couldn't be made today, even the \"Gone with the Wind\" getting pulled off the air for a while. You look at something like \"Blazing Saddles,\" which I thought was hysterical. You could never make that movie today. As far as onset, I'm going to find myself agreeing with Oliver Stone completely. Having a COVID adviser, having all these sensitivity advisers, having -- it's all regulation. And that regulation is job killing. It stops people from being able to make films. The small filmmakers can't afford all of these different advisers, all of these different people, so they won't be making as many movies and it really is a job killing thing and that's what President Trump doesn't get enough credit is the amount of deregulation he has done with our economy. It has been unbelievable. But that's not going to happen in Hollywood right now. Hopefully, there'll be a backlash, and we'll be able to clear things up and get back to work. KILMEADE: Hey, Dean, what's so amazing is, we're talking about a liberal industry that was very critical of the rest of the world, high and mighty and aloof, and now, that world has come back to bite them. It's almost like the #MeToo Movement that took Al Franken. Oops. CAIN: Yes, there's no question. Look, the left -- this whole cancel culture thing is a cancer. It's awful. It's terrible. I'm a hundred percent behind what Ricky Gervais says, free speech needs to be protected and the speech you don't like needs to be protected. I'm open to hear everyone's point of view, and I think everybody should be. Twitter being the cancel culture and those people getting out there and trying to get everybody fired. I have been the subject of numerous attacks over my beliefs or my support for President Trump or just literally anything. I've been attacked for this gaming chair I sit in. I mean, the most ridiculous stuff. So, I'm glad to see that that big letter came out last week to \"Harper's\" with JK Rowling and everybody else. I'm glad to see Bari Weiss do her thing. Andrew Sullivan, you know resign. I'm hoping that there's going to be some sort of real comeback to reality and this ridiculous cancel culture stuff is going to end. KILMEADE: And just my final wrap up for you Dean, and we have no time for you comment, but when things got -- when people started thinking that you were too conservative to book, you wrote your own movies, produced your own movies, did your own thing. That's why you cannot be stopped. You're a force, but top of the resume is \"Fox and Friends\" host. I hope that still says on there at the top of the ledger. CAIN: Yes. KILMEADE: All right, good job, Dean. Talk to you soon. CAIN: Thanks, Brian. Cheers. KILMEADE: Let's be honest, we didn't even inconvenience him, and all he did is put his knee on his desk and clicked on Skype. Meanwhile, the coronavirus outbreak appears to be getting worse in Florida, although these may be issues with how state laboratories are reporting new cases. Did you hear about this? WOFL's Robert Guaderrama has the story in our Orlando affiliate. Robert, what did you discover about how they're counting the coronavirus tests? ROBERT GUADERRAMA, FOX ORLANDO REPORTER: Yes, there seems to be confusion, Brian on so many levels here with the coronavirus numbers. Now, we were tipped off that the numbers didn't quite look right on the state's daily case report. And looking at the breakdown of test labs, I quickly noticed astronomical positivity rates. Now, mind you, Florida's COVID-19 positivity rates currently at just under 11 percent, but dozens of labs are reported as having 100 percent positivity. Some only reporting positive cases, the negative column absolutely blank. So, I asked myself, how could 100 percent of people getting tested at these locations be testing positive? So, I reached out to several of our major hospitals in the area, Orlando Health and the Orlando VA confirming errors in their numbers in that report. So after several requests for comment today, the Florida Department of Health confirming that some small private labs have failed to report negative results, some reporting zero negative results. So the department says, it is working to obtain those results and update the statewide report to fix those inaccuracies. But these labs are required by the state to report all test results -- positive and negative. A spokesperson -- here is something else that kind of adds to the confusion -- a spokesperson for Lee Memorial Hospital that's out of the Fort Myers area tells me that they believe there is a problem with the state's data gathering system, because it is their knowledge, their understanding that the negative results from their hospital were submitted to the state. So Brian, more questions to be answered, but this news all coming as so many Floridians already are doubting the numbers being reported by the state. KILMEADE: Because your death toll was so low thankfully, when someone says 98 percent positive, I meant 9.4 percent. I want every Fox affiliate at least to do exactly what you did and pour over these numbers and make people back them up. And Robert, I'm going to get your name right now, unlike how I introduced you, Robert Guaderrama. How did I do? GUADERRAMA: Guaderrama. There you go. KILMEADE: Close. All right, thanks a lot, man. Talk to you soon. Meanwhile, major news out of Washington with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in the hospital. New information is coming into us. This story is developing. Don't move. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: Fox News Alert. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for treatment for a possible infection is what they are telling us. She was initially treated at a hospital Washington last night. She was experiencing fever and chills. Doctors expect the 87-year-old Justice to remain in the hospital for at least a few days. We will keep you posted on her condition. The President was asked about it and wishes her the best. Meanwhile, urban unrest is tearing our nation's cities apart. Portland, Oregon, for example, has been experiencing violent mayhem for six straight weeks at tremendous cost to the city. Over the weekend, a Federal officer was beaten with a hammer outside the courthouse. Here's the video. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] KILMEADE: Jason Rantz has been all over this story. He is located in Seattle, a very successful talk show host who has a lot of contacts in the region. Jason, this is as bad as it gets in America. It's already cost the local businesses about $23 million in looting and rioting. I mean, this is organized, isn't it? JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: It's a hundred percent organized. You have people who are either loosely or very closely connected with local Antifa organizations, whether they're talking about these loose organizations of individuals who just share their dangerous ideology or they're literally communicating on Twitter and on Facebook and via signal of these different apps trying to get people to show up. And the reason why they keep showing up, the reason why you've had six weeks straight of this kind of violence is because every single day for the last six weeks in Portland and across this country, cops are being demonized and villainized. The bad behavior is being justified. You have politicians either too terrified to say anything for fear that they might upset the Democratic base that they rely on to keep them in power, or they're part of the people cheering this kind of stuff on and encouraging it. And so when you have this kind of message coming out, of course, people are going to feel more justified to put up this kind of violent act, whether it's Portland, Seattle, New York or D.C. KILMEADE: And this Mayor gave a little and he is paying the price. He's been humiliated and didn't waste any time blaming the President, said he made things worse by bringing Federal troops in. Really? RANTZ: Yes, it's always President Trump's fault. It definitely has nothing to do with the feckless, meek leadership of Ted Wheeler in Portland. It is so ridiculous. You have people who still want to pretend that the police are the problem. What's going on in Portland has nothing to do with George Floyd. Everything right now that's happening in Portland has to do with the anarchists, it has to do with a greater socialist ideology. I mean, we're having a nationwide conversation about defunding the police when we should be defending the police. The Federal agents, the Portland PD, cops all across this country are facing a war on them and it's getting out of control. KILMEADE: The F.B.I. needs to be called in. We've got to take apart the Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front. That's a division we understand of Antifa, another despicable organization. Jason, thanks for covering this. One day, I wish we could talk about this in past tense, but it's still going on tonight. Thanks, Jason. RANTZ: Unfortunately. Thank you. KILMEADE: Meanwhile, the nationwide -- you've got it -- meanwhile, the nationwide rioting story in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. Rioters there burned out a police precinct and looted many local businesses. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] KILMEADE: You believe that the governor of that state wants us, the taxpayers, to pay for that anarchy? Amid the unrest, residents in the Minneapolis Powderhorn Park neighborhood decide to so-called check their privilege by collectively agreeing never to call the police again. One man told \"The New York Times\" that he regretted calling 911 after he was robbed at gunpoint. So, how did that turn out? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Powderhorn Park has become a city of sorts. What started out as 20 to 30 tents, we're told is now at 560 tents and about 700 people. The encampment does offer plenty of free food. We're told there's laundry service. There's restrooms and showers. It even has its own security of sorts. We were told we needed permission to be on the sidewalk around the park. Neighbors who live near the park say they are no longer welcome or feel safe to use the park. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: The sprawling homeless encampment is now associated with three separate sexual assaults, and you know, there's many more. Since \"The Times\" first report on the neighborhoods decision to not call the police anymore. Naturally, many locals now want to leave. One resident told the local paper that people are fleeing the neighborhood because no one is, quote, \"protecting their rights to a safe neighborhood.\" No kidding. Scott Johnson has been reporting on the Powderhorn Park for Power Line. He joins us now from Minneapolis. This is the most predictable problem in the history of America. How do you get out of this? SCOTT JOHNSON, POWER LINE BLOGS: Well, that's a difficult question. But I think you've done the right thing in identifying where the trouble comes from. It comes in Minnesota. It comes right from the top, Governor Walz. One of the 78 Executive Orders that he has promulgated in the era of one man rule following the COVID-19 epidemic prohibited law enforcement from removing homeless people from parks, and the Powderhorn Park is one of 38 in the City of Minneapolis with homeless encampments in it. And it's grown in the way that you said to include 560 tents. Tomorrow night, the Parks Board is meeting to try to bring the number down from 38 parks with homeless encampments in them to 20 parks with homeless encampments in them. In Minneapolis, that would be progress, but it's really pathetic. And despite the sanitation that you refer to in the introduction, you know, I took a drive around there this afternoon. It's disgusting. No surprise there either. So I think it would be progress if they reduce the number of parks with homeless encampments to 20, reduce the number of tents as they kind of played doing to 25, and start enforcing the law and finding alternative facilities for these people who prefer to be in the parks rather than in facilities where they came from. KILMEADE: Scott Johnson, thanks so much. We're about to lose your feed, but I have got 20,000 more questions to ask you, but what do we learn from this? Appreciate you work for Power Line for us. We learned, when you give a little, you get nothing but abuse. It happened in Minneapolis. It happened in Seattle. It happened in Portland and it's never stopped in Minneapolis, too. Meanwhile, coming up straight ahead, Tucker is making an appearance right here on his own show. Can you believe it? You don't want to miss Tucker's interview on how you can get a great education without attending a university. That story, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: Got some good news. Tucker is back to take a look at whether college is really worth it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TUCKER CARLSON,\u00a0 HOST,: As if you needed more proof that higher education is the most sophisticated and most predatory racket underway in this country right now, there's this. Harvard just announced its classes will be entirely online this fall. But the school isn't taking a single dime off its tuition. That's still $50,000.00 a year. Of course, it's by design. That tuition is not paying for a better education, it is paying for bloated administrator salaries, and an army of pointless bureaucrats. In fact, not just pointless, but some of them poisonous. Right now, for example, the University of California system has 280,000 students enrolled. At the same time, it has 227,000 employees. Do the math on that. Isaac Morehouse has. He's a CEO of Crash.co. It's a company that helps people without degrees get good paying jobs. He also founded Praxis, an organization that's now paying kids $1,000.00 to drop out of college and enter apprenticeships instead. Isaac, we're happy to have you on always. So it seems like this is a moment for you because a lot of people, correct me, if I'm wrong, are starting to realize that college is a scam. ISAAC MOREHOUSE, CEO, CRASH.CO: Yes, it's a huge moment. I mean -- this -- college has basically been scamming young people for a long time, and it's been able to get away with it because they're heavily subsidized through tax dollars, protected from competition. They're essentially monopolies. And there's been a religious superstition that you have to get that degree. You've got to get that bullet point on your resume, and I think more and more people see that that's not true. I mean, what you just said, if you're paying $50,000.00 to go to classes on Zoom, you know, the argument that you're getting some intangible benefits, like the only intangibles are the pensions of the administrators are getting. That's why that's funded. So, more people are awake to this, which I think is a great thing. It's been a huge opportunity for people to see what really matters on the job market. CARLSON: So, it's I mean -- I mean, this isn't just a conversation about the ethics of whether or not to go to college because I think there are big ethical implications in it. But the money doesn't even make sense. Give us an idea -- because most parents are afraid not to send their kids to college. Give us an idea what your options are, if you don't want to send your kids? What their options are? MOREHOUSE: Yes, it's amazing how few people think about what it is they actually need to win a job. And I'll tell you right now that you know, hey, look, I bought a degree and I listed it on my resume. You can burn your resume. I'm telling you, that's not how you get a job anymore. You have to gain some real skills, and then pitch companies on the value you can create for them. That's kind of what we help people do with Crash is to create, you know, something that showcases their skills in a tangible way, instead of just saying here, this institution said that I'm okay. You know, I passed. And so if you can get those skills, like I'm telling you right now, you can do this in months or a year or two. A lot of programs like Praxis, you don't even pay tuition unless you get a job. So there's direct accountability and a lot of boot camps out there. You know, you can go and you can apprentice or intern and get the experience first before you sink a bunch of money that you're never going to get back. I mean, college isn't going to give you a refund if you don't get hired. They're going to be laughing all the way to the bank with that money. So there's a lot of opportunity out there to discover, you know, the kind of things that you're interested in and then build things around those, actually do something tangible instead of just, you know, sort of following the rules and saying, hey, I got this credential. CARLSON: So there's not a correlation between getting some credential and your effectiveness. Really quickly, how does a parent or a child who is thinking about what to do next get involved with Crash? MOREHOUSE: Yes, so Crash is really designed for, if you are on the job market now and that could be an internship, it could be a first job. It's really a way to find how to showcase your skills and not have to rely on having fancy credentials or anything like that and put together compelling pitches to companies and we kind of help you walk through that process. And you know, if you're ready for that, if you're ready for the job market now, definitely check out Crash.co.\u00a0If you're not, I would encourage you to look into boot camps. If you're interested in coding. There's a host of coding boot camps. Praxis is a boot camp for non-coders. And again, right now, Praxis is offering if you're going to drop out of college, they'll pay you $1,000.00 and it's really rigorous training in the skills, in demand in fast growing companies today. So I mean, those are just a couple of places to start. But there's more opportunity than there's ever been to learn relevant skills. And I'm telling you, none of that opportunity is in college classrooms right now. CARLSON: That's right. We're all unlearning the GI Bill, 75 years later. Isaac, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. MOREHOUSE: Thanks for having me, Tucker. (END VIDEOTAPE) KILMEADE: Yes, the Zoom College is making everyone consider that, too. Meanwhile, straight ahead, Joe Biden's handlers finally let him out of his own basement. So, how did it go? How is he doing? We're going to find out. Today, he took a cue from AOC and says we only have nine years to save the planet and I'm talking about our favorite planet, Earth. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: All right, Joe Biden emerged from his basement and kind of hit the campaign trail in his own town a few minutes away from his house. This afternoon he made it very clear that you should probably keep him away from your children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: To get our people to work and our kids at school safely, to get our kids to market swiftly, to power clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America's infrastructure. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Right, a little confused by the crawl as well as the statement. Well, he better get the kids to market soon because the planet does not have much time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Okay, in the spirit of that, Biden embraced a $2 trillion Green New Deal proposal while we can all agree that the plan will radically expand Biden's power over all of us. Not everyone agrees that will help fight global warming. Michael Shellenberger is the President of Environmental Progress, and bestselling author of \"Apocalypse Never.\" Helped write the New Green Deal. Michael, what do you think -- what do you say to Joe Biden's proposal from what we know, adding to the $2 trillion over four years to have all clean energy. He wants a hundred percent clean electricity standards by 2035. MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS: The problem is that we already know the effects of these policies, I hope to implement them and advocate them in the early 2000s. We spent over $250 billion on renewables, and everywhere they're deployed at scale, electricity prices go up. In fact, a former Obama administration economist did a major study for the University of Chicago finding that in all the states that did renewable mandates, electricity prices rose. In my home State of California, electricity prices rose six times more than the national average. So, you're actually paying twice. We're paying first with subsidies, which increase the deficit, and then we're also paying higher electricity prices. And then the second big concern, of course, is that because renewables are so inefficient, industrial wind farms and industrial solar farms require about 400 times more land than a natural gas or nuclear plant. The impacts on wildlife are enormous. So, we see industrial wind turbines, killing condors, bald eagles, and now they want to string up transmission lines through the sand hills of Nebraska, which would potentially kill whooping cranes, one of our most beloved endangered species. KILMEADE: Mike, who's writing this stuff? This is something that we heard Jay Inslee talk about, we heard Elizabeth Warren talk about. This has never been part of Joe Biden's agenda. Since when? SHELLENBERGER: Well, that's probably fair. I mean, I think the obvious thing, if you cared about nuclear power, you would do nuclear energy. If you cared about climate change, sorry, you would do nuclear power. The only country that significantly reduced its emissions is France, 75 percent nuclear. It spends about half as much electricity as Germany, which is phasing out nuclear and scaling up renewables. Look, I just think that the radical left has just taken a big part of the Democratic Party. One of the things that I was really surprised to discover in researching \"Apocalypse Never\" is that really it's just about a dozen people that were major donors to President Obama who benefited the most from really about $90 billion in subsidies, in taxpayer subsidies. So my concern here is it's not just that it's bad for consumers, it's bad for workers. You increase energy prices and there's always the risk that more jobs will go to China. Unemployment is already at 10 percent. But it also just ends up rewarding the insiders, the people that have special access to the President. KILMEADE: Michael, 30 seconds. What will happen if we rejoin the Paris Climate deal? SHELLENBERGER: Look, I think there's always been this effort by United Nations officials and some scientists who want to try to control energy and food production around the world. Those decisions are really best made by countries on their own. Look, you know, most carbon emissions in rich countries have gone down. Our carbon emissions have gone down over the last 15 years. In \"Apocalypse Never\" I talk about how that's actually due to the fracking natural gas revolution, which most environmentalists oppose. So the two technologies that have done the most to address climate change and reduce humankind's impact on natural environment, fracking and nuclear power are actually opposed by candidate Biden's coalition and that's what concerns me. KILMEADE: Yes, interesting. And so it was great to be in agreement with Russia and China, they always live up to their obligations. Michael, thanks so much. Appreciate your expertise. It's a great book. SHELLENBERGER: Thanks so much. KILMEADE: Meanwhile, we forge ahead. Nearly four years -- you're welcome -- after her humiliating election defeat, Hillary Clinton is still refusing to go away. In an ironic twist, now, she fears that if Trump loses, he won't go away either. That story, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton fears that Trump might refuse to leave office if he loses the election in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think it is a fair point to raise as to whether or not if he loses, he's going to go quietly or not, and we have to be ready for that. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Someone should tell that host, it's summer. One person who refused to go away after losing a presidential election is of course, Hillary Clinton. Tammy Bruce is host of \"Get Tammy Bruce\" on the great Fox Nation app. She joins us now. Tammy, why is she saying this? TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, she obviously is projecting, bright as classical projection where she is accusing her opponent of doing what she is doing. She is the only person maybe other than Stacey Abrams, who has for years now refused to accept the result of 2016 and she is showing that. Now look, at the same time, she should be asked -- nobody asked her why she isn't fighting for her second term. She should be running. I mean, obviously Trump is running for his second term. She really believes that she won the presidency. She should be fighting for her second term, but she's not doing that at all. I mean, this is -- the only other explanation is that she broke into the Chardonnay cabinet and keeps thinking that it's 2016, it's hard to say. But the fact is also, that all of this stuff with mail-in ballots and the problems that Democrat allied groups have been creating in cities, various riots and problems is that they may be anticipating creating a dynamic with a voting system that is so corrupt and so chaotic, that maybe they're hoping that we wouldn't really know who the winner would be if it was close, and they're preparing people for that kind of chaos. This is what the Clintons would do. They know they're not going to win the White House because of who their nominee is, but also because of the success of the President. And we're watching something fascinating unfold. The only show she hasn't done yet, Brian, by the way, is \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and she might want to think about moving into that direction at this point because she'll lose that to. KILMEADE: Tammy, you're onto something, though, because Joe Biden said the same thing. I'm afraid he's not going to leave. They're going to have to haul him out, and the Republicans would be insane to allow this mail-in balloting for the masses. BRUCE: That's right. KILMEADE: Lastly, Christopher Steele is in a court case now and he is asked about the dossier and what went into it. One of the things he said I found fascinating that he was under the belief that Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton both knew that he was investigating the Trump campaign. BRUCE: Yes, I mean, this is important. We don't have the Durham report yet about the entire nature of what was happening and the Trump campaign being targeted. So people are going to be inevitably indicted at some point, and someone might want to you know, give up the scope of the nature of what this was. But they knew to ask him about this in this obscure trial in England, brought by a few Russians who were accused by him as well, and they had F.B.I. notes, where Steele told the F.B.I. that Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS told him -- he remembers being told by Simpson himself that Hillary knew and was involved. And so that's when they asked about that. They got him on the record in this new legal case, and of course -- of course, look, this is the most -- this is a woman with control issues. You see her. She still can't let go of what happened in 20. Of course, she was going to be at least involved or knowing a bit, no one was going to go off and do something like that on their own without her knowing about it. She controlled that infrastructure, and when it collapsed, is when everything obviously when she lost is when everything started to become exposed. So, this should be interesting. We're not at the end of this. Americans deserve justice, and hopefully at a point coming up soon, we might start seeing that happen for us. KILMEADE: Yes, I just think that she stay in the wings just in case fragile Joe Biden cannot finish this run in a very odd year, one of the oddest election cycles in the history of this country. Tammy Bruce, always great to talk to you. I'll see you soon. BRUCE: Thank you, Brian. Thank you. KILMEADE: All right. Meanwhile, that's about it for us tonight. Don't forget to tune in to the \"Brian Kilmeade Radio Show.\" I know you'll love it. It's nine to noon Eastern time. That's every single day, Monday through Friday. Also \"Fox and Friends\" six to nine. I'll be wearing a different outfit, I promise. Also, I want you to do this, tune in each night at eight o'clock to watch the show or you could DVR the show. You know the show's slogan is, the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a great evening, everybody. I appreciate you watching. Now. It's time to go over to my good friend, possibly my only real friend. He's got great hair, that he's been ready to go since about six o'clock in the morning. The great Sean Hannity.

This is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" July 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR: Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining us straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": a crime at the epidemic sweeping the United States and cities across the country, amid calls to defund the police. The murder rate spikes in California, New Orleans, Los Angeles, with shootings in Chicago jumping 75 percent in June alone. Coming up, America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, with a message for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, shootings there up 130 percent, the violence unfolding against the backdrop of the 2020 election, now just 113 days away. What's President Trump's plan to get us out of this? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is here to lay out POTUS' second-term agenda. We will also hear from Donald Trump Jr. this morning on the one issue he thinks will determine the winner, all of this as John Durham continues his deep dive into the origins of the Russia probe. Will he finish his investigation before the election? Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, will weigh in. Also here this morning, Senator John Barrasso with breaking news on the next stimulus package and when to expect it. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin with Joe Biden unveiling his $700 billion buy America plan last week, with an emphasis on U.S. goods, jobs and manufacturing. Biden's proposal may ring the bell for viewers of this program. Here's White House trade adviser Peter Navarro just a few weeks ago on the president's first plan back on March 15. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: It's a three-pronged strategy consistent with what President Trump has done from the get-go in terms of onshoring jobs. It's buy American, it's deregulate, and it's innovate technology. The buy American issue, Maria, is, we have HHS, the VA and DOD as large consumers of pharmaceuticals. We have got to get them to buy American over the long term, so we have a stable source of demand, so that that will attract investment. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is Peter Navarro, back with us. He's assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing. Peter, it is good to see you this morning. NAVARRO: Hey, Maria. BARTIROMO: Well, obviously, Joe Biden agrees... NAVARRO: Yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: ... with your plan to buy America. Your reaction to the former vice president's economic plan released this past week. NAVARRO: A poll-driven, plagiarist, buy China Joe Biden. I was astonished by that, given Joe Biden's history. I think everybody remembers back in 1988, when Biden ran for president, and did the trifecta of plagiarism, when he ripped off JFK, RFK and Neil Kinnock in speeches and had to withdraw from the race in shame and embarrassment. And now he's just blatantly ripping off the president's buy American agenda, which goes back to the president going down the escalator with beautiful Melania. It started back then. Guess what? I have personally been at the president's side when he has signed at least seven buy American orders. That's seven more than Biden signed or Obama signed during their term. And every one of those has worked to create American jobs. We dramatically reduced the waivers, increased the amount of buy American in-government procurement. We upped the amount of iron and steel to close to 100 percent. And so, listening to Joe Biden, I thought it was a really bad judgment. And whoever wrote that speech and put that in the puppet's head there, I think they might be looking for a new job soon. BARTIROMO: Well, Peter, he also said that he will take the corporate tax rate back up. The president, of course, in his tax legislation of 2017 cut the corporate rate to 21 percent. Biden says it should be at 28 percent. Wall Street seems to think Elizabeth Warren is the key economic voice in Biden's plan. She wants to raise taxes on everyone and also institute a wealth tax for the wealthiest individuals. And he's also talking about changing -- he said he wants to change shareholder capitalism. NAVARRO: Sure. BARTIROMO: What do you make of all of that? NAVARRO: Well, I think that's a good way of talking about what President Trump is going to do in his second term, because what President Trump is going to do is finish what he started. And the whole four points of the policy compass going back to the campaign was deregulation, cut taxes, dominate in energy, and have fair trade deals. And everything that Biden wants to do and is running on is directly opposite that, directly opposite to the direction of growing the economy. So, that's what the president is going to do. And we got to a point with this president, best jobs president in history, where he had the best economy in American history, in middle of January, we had the unemployment rate down for record lows for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women. And we were cruising along, until the Chinese Communist Party basically hit us with that deadly virus, that weaponized virus. And I don't think it's any coincidence that the first year that China had a down economy was the same year now that they're coming after us in all sorts of ways. And Joe Biden is the candidate of the Chinese Communist Party. Trump, buy American, Joe Biden, buy China. BARTIROMO: All right. Let me ask you about China, because, of course, we saw now a pushback in terms of sanctions on individuals in China responsible for taking away Hong Kong freedoms. People are waiting for the president to sign that in terms of the sanctions on those individuals. Why should the U.S. be acting aggressively on Hong Kong? NAVARRO: Yes. BARTIROMO: Do you want to open borders for Hong Kong citizens to come to America? What's the plan? NAVARRO: For decades, the Chinese Communist Party used Hong Kong as a weapon to attack the American manufacturing base and vacuum jobs and capital back to the Chinese mainland. Do you know what, Maria? We put up with that, in support of a free and Democratic Hong Kong. BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: But now that China has taken away their economy, they have effectively turned it just into another concentration camp, like Xinjiang, Tibet, and the rest of the Chinese mainland, now that that has happened, President Trump, going back to a speech in the Rose Garden at the end of May, said, we're going to strip them of all preferential treatment, so that they can't harm American workers anymore, and we're going to punish those responsible. And so you can expect, early this week, the president to sign both the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and an executive order which will complete the process that the president started on May 29 in the Rose Garden. We cannot let Chinese Communist Party use Hong Kong anymore to attack the American economy. BARTIROMO: OK. Yes. NAVARRO: So that's coming. The other thing that's on the table that we need to talk about is this whole TikTok, WeChat social media thing. BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: Here is the thing, Maria. What the American people have to understand is, all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property. Those apps can be used to steal personal and financial information for blackmail and extortion. They can be used to steal business intellectual property and proprietary secrets. The worst thing they use them for, besides surveilling and tracking Americans, the worst thing they do is engage in information warfare against the American people, against this president. The Chinese Communist Party wants Joe Biden more than anything right now, and the American people should not be subject to information warfare. The other thing about TikTok, for example, and WeChat... BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: ... even what -- this is really interesting. They're running the same playbook as Huawei, right? Put an American puppet in charge of Huawei as the CEO and say, hey, everything is going to be fine. We're going to be separate. They're trying that game with TikTok. Not going to work. TikTok is the biggest -- TikTok and WeChat are the biggest forms of censorship on the Chinese mainland. And so expect strong action on that. Expect action, action, action from this president on buy American, on China, on jobs. And this is the president that gets things done for the American people. BARTIROMO: Yes. You know, you mentioned the person running TikTok. It is actually extraordinary. This is -- this was the number two guy at Disney, Kevin Mayer, who is now the CEO of TikTok... NAVARRO: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... an American, but, obviously, the Chinese -- the Chinese individual... NAVARRO: Running dog puppet. BARTIROMO: ... who is a Communist member is the chairman. But this is what I thought was really interesting. This week, we had a headline that says Democratic National Committee is warning that campaign - - against campaigns on using TikTok. NAVARRO: Yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: Even the Democratic National Committee is voicing concern. NAVARRO: Yes. BARTIROMO: Amazon, of course, we know already banned TikTok from employee phones. NAVARRO: Actually, Maria, they didn't. BARTIROMO: So, you say these are data collectors? NAVARRO: Yes, Amazon actually... BARTIROMO: He said he was going to, Jeff Bezos. NAVARRO: Yes. Yes. They announced it, and then they backed away from it, which shows the power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America. And that's the problem. This guy who is running TikTok now, a Disney executive, who is more compromised than the Disney kingdom over in China? Because they want to sell all their Disney World tickets over there. They want to sell all their Disney content. And so what -- if TikTok, if it separates as an American company, that doesn't help us, because it's going to be worth -- we're going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of having TikTok operate on U.S. soil. BARTIROMO: Well... NAVARRO: So, TikTok, WeChat and -- India banned 70 of these things. So TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two. BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was just going to say, because India has banned TikTok. Is the president going to? NAVARRO: I never get ahead of the president, but we are looking very closely at this problem. BARTIROMO: OK. NAVARRO: And just run through the checklist. BARTIROMO: OK. NAVARRO: The information warfare, surveillance and tracking, stealing your data. No American -- the parents -- their kids are sitting there with TikTok. I mean, data right out of the household is going to the Chinese Communist Party. BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: What can go wrong there? BARTIROMO: Peter... NAVARRO: So, what we need to do -- jobs and China, that's what this campaign is about. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: All right, we will be watching. Great to talk with you, as always, Peter. Thank you so much, Peter Navarro from the White House this morning. Coming up: Will John Durham complete his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe in time to impact the 2020 election? The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, will weigh in after this break. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back. Attorney General Bill Barr told me that the Russian collusion narrative was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a coup since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Yet, according to a new Rasmussen poll, most voters do not know there's evidence that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were even involved in it. A.G. Barr recently spoke to me about the status of John Durham's investigation on the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: He's pressing ahead as hard as he can. And I expect that we will have some developments hopefully before the end of this summer. But, as I have said, his investigation will continue. It's not going to stop because of the election. What happens after the election may depend on who wins the election. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Congressman Jim Jordan is the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You bet. Good to be with you. BARTIROMO: Where are we on the John Durham investigation, sir? What do you know? JORDAN: Well, we know what Bill Barr has told us. Now, the attorney general will be in front of the Judiciary Committee in two weeks. I'm sure he will get asked about this and a number of other issues. But the attorney general has said that he expects something this summer. We're obviously -- we're hitting the summer, so let's hope it happens. Let's hope it happens before the election. I will tell you this, Maria. The number one question I get, whether I'm in the Fourth District of Ohio or traveling around our state or traveling around the country, the number one question I get from people is, they will walk up to me and says, when is somebody going to jail? And the reason they say that is because they're sick of the double standard, this idea that there's one set of rules for the politically connected in D.C. and a different set for us regular folks. So let's hope we have the investigation done before the election. Let's hope that someone is going to be held accountable for the major wrongdoing that took place when they targeted the president's campaign and spied on the president's campaign. BARTIROMO: Well, it's pretty extraordinary. And we know that there was always criminality done, whether it's leaking confidential information, or changing a document of evidence, which is -- one of the FBI agents already did that. They changed a document. JORDAN: Yes. BARTIROMO: Or maybe it was entrapment, lying to investigators. So, how come we haven't seen any charges yet? I mean, there are, what, 14 referrals of criminal charges already from you and your colleagues? JORDAN: Yes. I mean, who knows. But here is how bad it was. Michael Flynn, 38 different people 49 different times unmasked Michael Flynn's name between Election Day 2016 and Inauguration Day in January 2017. So, in that short two-month time period, 49 separate times, they were unmasking his name, even though they already knew, all these people already knew that there was no basis for the investigation to begin with. And how do we know that they knew there was no basis, there was no proper predicate? Because, when they testified, they told us that. Ric Grenell released the testimony of Comey and Clapper and Brennan and Rice and Samantha Power, released all of the testimony. And they all said the same thing: We never saw any evidence of any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But they investigated it anyway, even up until the time when Bob Mueller was named special counsel. Jim Comey, when we deposed him in the House last Congress, when we deposed him, he said: After 10 months, we didn't have anything. But Comey does what? Leaks his memo, so we get two years of Bob Mueller, leaks his memos for the express purpose of getting a special counsel named. And then we had the 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 subpoenas, 2,800 or 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and $30 million to tell us what we already knew, what they already knew, that there was nothing there. So let's hope that, ultimately, someone is held accountable. BARTIROMO: Do you think there will be indictments? JORDAN: I hope so. I mean, I have said this all along. I think Jim Comey is the biggest culprit here. It was the Comey cabal, this small handful of people at the top of the FBI. And then, remember, Bill Barr, the first time he testified, said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page, they all left or had to be fired as the key people... BARTIROMO: Yes. JORDAN: ... who ran the Clinton investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey is the ringleader here. I hope they give him a second look. And I hope he's ultimately held accountable. BARTIROMO: Let me ask you. Let me switch gears, ask you about your committee, the Judiciary Committee's closed-door testimony of Geoffrey Berman. I have in front of me your takeaways from the committee's transcribed interview with Berman. Nadler says that Barr dealings with Berman often came close to bribery. Your reaction? And tell us what you can about that closed-door hearing. JORDAN: Well, first of all, Mr. Nadler's statement is ridiculous. When we deposed Mr. Berman, he said very clearly -- we asked him about his meeting with Bill Barr on June 19 in New York. We said, did you talk about any cases? No. Did you talk about any suspects? No. Did you talk about any witnesses to any cases? No. Did you talk about the president? No,. There was nothing there. The attorney general and the president of the United States are entitled to have the people they want as U.S. attorneys around the country. That's all this was. The Democrats, because they don't like the fact that Bill Barr is trying to get to the bottom of what took place in the previous Justice Department, the Obama-Biden-Comey Justice Department, because they don't like the fact that he's trying to clean up the politics that existed in the previous administration, they continue to go after him, so much so that they filed articles of impeachment against the attorney general just a week-and-a-half ago. BARTIROMO: Yes. JORDAN: That's how ridiculous the Democrats are. BARTIROMO: Congressman, I have got to ask you about tech tyranny and the upcoming hearings that you're going to have in Judiciary. We will hear from people like Apple's CEO, Google's CEO, Facebook, Twitter in a hearing on July 25 or 28. Tell me about your letter to Jack Dorsey about the president's tweets and what you're expecting out of technology, big tech. Are they going to try to sway the election in November? JORDAN: Well, Maria, I always start with this simple question. Why is does always seem that it's just conservatives who get censored or shadowbanned by these big tech companies? Why was it two years ago that there are 435 members of the House, there are 100 members of the Senate, 535, but only four were shadowbanned, Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan? Interesting four. I always say -- when we send a letter to Jack Dorsey, when we brought this to his attention, he indicated that, oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm, to which I responded, glitch in your algorithm? What did you put in the algorithm, the names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan? I mean, it's always conservatives. (LAUGHTER) JORDAN: Why is it only the president -- why is it only the president who gets censored? You never see them going after Joe Biden. Why is it just -- why was it The Federalist that Google tried to demonetize? BARTIROMO: Yes. JORDAN: You never see a liberal news outlet trying to be demonetized. So, that, to me, is the fundamental question. And that has got to change, because, in America today, if only one side is allowed to talk, that's not the First Amendment. You got to have a real debate. And this cancel culture mob and the impact they have on these big tech companies is a scary road we're traveling down. And it needs to stop. And that's what we're going to focus on as Republicans in these hearings. BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's great to have you this morning. We will be watching, certainly, closely. It's so wonderful to get your take on all of this, Congressman Jim Jordan. Coming up, Rudy Giuliani is here on the Supreme Court decision that President Trump should turn over his tax returns. That's coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: The Supreme Court making headlines on Thursday, ruling that President Trump's financial and tax records are fair game for New York prosecutors. The president since calling decision not fair. But is it really the slam- dunk victory his critics were hoping for? Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York for six years. And, Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Always a pleasure, Maria, yes, absolutely. BARTIROMO: So... GIULIANI: So, that case is really terribly decided. But go ahead. BARTIROMO: No, about the tax returns. GIULIANI: Oh. BARTIROMO: Are you going -- are you going to be responding in any way? Will the tax releases have any bearing on the election, in your view? GIULIANI: Well, first of all, there's still room for opposition. You could make the argument that they have no particularized need for it. You could also make the argument that they are not investigating any particularized crime. They have no reason to believe that there's anything wrong with his tax returns. I mean, all these tax returns have been, by and large -- maybe not the last one -- but all of them have been audited. All of them have been either passed on or settled. And there should be something in your tax returns. In other words, we get audited, we make a deal, we pay the government, you don't come after me forever for that. And, also, this is the president of the United States. There are literally 400 -- 4,000 prosecutors who can now come after his records. I don't think the court ever thought of that. So there may be a chance to revisit this. The burden this would place on the executive, like, if you had an opposition party -- and look at the DAs we have now. We have Soros-elected anarchist DAs. They're not there to prosecute the law. They are there to undermine the law. He put them there. Why would Soros pay for DAs, other than to undermine our government? BARTIROMO: Wow. GIULIANI: He got people elected who release criminals, don't prosecute cases. In Philadelphia, they won't even bring a case to the DA, he's so anti-police, pro-criminal. Five years, Soros has been funding these. And nobody paid attention to it. But he had a reason. It's to undermine our government. And I think we have a chance to revisit this. Also, we can argue that they have no need for it. This is a fishing expedition. I mean, I think we fight them right down to the wire. BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about what's happening to our cities, Rudy. You oversaw New York City becoming the safest city on your leadership because of the moves you made. Look at New York City right now, shootings soaring to 205 percent. What will it take to get this city back with law and order? Shooting incidences up 130 percent, murder up 23 percent, burglary up 118 percent. What is your reaction to Mayor de Blasio's new plan, he says, to take back the blocks, relying heavily on community members on the streets? GIULIANI: Well, I mean, the reality is, he's already amended that plan, because it was -- I mean, it's stupid throughout, but he was going to have community leaders accompany the police, until, last night, he had another night of violence that was unreal. So now the community leaders are not going to accompany the police. I think they got an idea, hey, Mayor, you go with them. Maybe we don't want to go, because they shoot at us. We had a terrible situation with a domestic violence thing last night. I mean, it's a disaster, Maria. I have never seen it like this. I mean, there were more murders in the city under Dinkins, 2,400, 2,200, but we never had this total disrespect for the police. Even in those bad old days, nobody was going to spit at a police officer, nobody was going to punch a police officer. And they took advantage of the no choke hold last night in an incident that I have a videotape of, where the police officer couldn't get ahold of him. The guy put a choke hold on the cop and almost killed him, and he couldn't defend himself. BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. GIULIANI: I mean, we're going to get a cop killed with that stupid no choke hold thing, the way it's interpreted. We're getting cops killed. And the reaction -- the reality is, it's worse because this is a breakdown in general respect for the police, for our government, and hatred for our country. And there's a purpose to it. These people are Marxists. They want to take over our government. When are we going to wake up and realize that? Just go read what they write. BARTIROMO: Well... GIULIANI: Look at the fact that the woman who is taking in the money for the BLM is a convicted terrorist who should be in jail for 58 years, except crooked Clinton pardoned her, a terrorist who was involved in police killings. She is handling the money for the Black Lives Matter. This is a woman dedicated to the overthrow of our government. BARTIROMO: And, look, Mayor de Blasio obviously cut the budget for the NYPD by a billion dollars. You said the last time you were with me that Governor Cuomo can replace Mayor de Blasio. How come he hasn't done it yet then? The New York A.G. is recommending de Blasio should no longer have the authority in New York enforcement matters. Is that enough? GIULIANI: Well, you know, I will give him the citation. It's Article 1, Section 9 of the New York City charter, which I pretty much have memorized. It says that the governor can remove the mayor. You don't even have to have cause. Now precedent would say it would have to be corruption, like they attempted to remove Jimmy Walker, but he resigned. Or it could be gross incompetence. Or it could be putting the lives of New Yorkers in jeopardy. Bill de Blasio, through his incompetence, has killed New Yorkers. His negligence in dealing with COVID is outrageous, the things he didn't do and the things that he encouraged. BARTIROMO: Yes. GIULIANI: They criticize President Trump for being late. He was telling people to go to gyms two weeks into it, two weeks after the president made it clear, this is very dangerous. BARTIROMO: Wow. It certainly feels like a different city today, I will tell you. You just don't feel safe in New York City. I want to switch gears. You were the A.G. for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989, where Ghislaine Maxwell is now being indicted. Reaction to the charges. Do you think she's going to name names? What's your reaction to this Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell situation? GIULIANI: Well, I don't know all the people there now, but the person in charge, Audrey Strauss, was a colleague of mine. And she's a very, very -- she's a very good lawyer and a very honest and down-the-middle-kind of prosecutor. I can only guess what Maxwell has. And it sounds like she's got tapes, and it would not make sense if they didn't. I mean, they were pretty smart people. They have been protected for a long time. There must be a reason for that. They must have a lot of things on a lot of people. And it's going to be really interesting to see. BARTIROMO: Yes. GIULIANI: You can't argue with a tape. You can't argue. There's got to be a lot of people very scared over the last couple of days. And I'd like to keep her alive, guys. I mean, you know, she is in a prison. BARTIROMO: Yes. GIULIANI: You can keep somebody alive in a prison. BARTIROMO: All right. GIULIANI: And if they need any help, if they need any help on how to keep somebody alive in a prison, I used to also run the Bureau of Prisons. I think I could show them. BARTIROMO: All right, Rudy, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Great to see you. GIULIANI: You know you're the best. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Coming up next: Donald Trump Jr. is here with his reaction to the Black Lives Matter mural in New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint right outside of Trump Tower this week, where he works every day. We are going to get his reaction when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New photographs this morning of President Trump wearing a mask publicly for the first time yesterday during his visit to Walter Reed Hospital. The president, who met with wounded soldiers and medical workers, told reporters he loves masks in the appropriate locations, but still believes they have a time and place. Joining us right now with reaction is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr. And, Don, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: It's my pleasure, Maria. How are you? BARTIROMO: Yes, great. Interesting to see your dad donning a mask. Obviously, things are serious. You have got the potential of a second spike. How is Kimberly doing? We know that Kimberly has contracted COVID, along with a top convention person. Is she OK? TRUMP JR.: She's 100 percent fine. She's -- zero symptoms, zero anything. We're in quarantine, obviously, and I am too because of proximity. But, other than that, you really wouldn't know that there's anything even going on. So, it's been good. I -- under the circumstances, it's as good as it can get. And I also saw my father looked pretty good in the mask the other day. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP JR.: And I think what people also have to realize, when he talks about there being a time and place, anyone who comes into proximity with him is literally tested that day, is literally tested moments before they allow access. So he's obviously going to be much less susceptible to this than anyone else, because, literally, there is a daily screening process if you're going to even be within proximity to him. So I think that's important for people to note. But when he's going to Walter Reed to visit our sick and our wounded soldiers, he's going to take that very seriously. BARTIROMO: Yes, but people are taking seriously the idea that we are seeing a second wave potentially, and spikes in some hot spots across the country. What does that mean for the convention, Don? And what about the idea that, look, the Democrats have already said they're going to do a virtual convention? There are polls that have Biden either tied with Trump or actually leading Donald Trump. Your thoughts of all of these worries going into the convention and then, of course, the election? TRUMP JR.: Well, I think, for the Democrats, of course they want to do a virtual convention, because there's no enthusiasm for Joe Biden. He can't get people to show up a rally, if he was able to do rallies. So this whole scenario is really the ultimate best-case scenario for Joe Biden and his campaign. They don't want him on the stump. They don't want him speaking to reporters. They don't want him ad-libbed. Honestly, they don't even want him on a teleprompter, because he can't even get that right. So, for them, it's sort of the ultimate. I think, with our convention, there's a lot of people that want to do it. They want to be enthusiastic. But we can do that and we can do it safely. We can take the necessary precautions. We can protect the people that are going to be there. We can implement things that you wouldn't necessarily normally implement at a convention to do so. So, they're going to take it very seriously. We're going to do a great job with it, and it's going to be an awesome event. BARTIROMO: What does the president need to get these numbers up? Are you buying these polls? It looks like one after the next. It is a real tight race. And, in many cases, Biden is leading the president. TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, I think, when you have the media onslaught, where a media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides, they're not looking into any of Biden's past. They're not looking into any of his history. They're not looking into his family's graft. They're not looking into how insanely soft he's been on China throughout his entire career. And let's not forget, this is a 50-year career in Washington, D.C. They're trying to run him like he's a moderate outsider. This guy is the epitome of the swamp. So they want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden. He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because, once he is, you will see how terrible this notion could be for America. BARTIROMO: Which is why you're out with a upcoming book, \"Liberal Privilege.\" You're going to talk a lot about Biden in this book, right? You're self- publishing a book? When is it coming out, Don? TRUMP JR.: A hundred percent. I guess one of offshoots, one of the only positive things of quarantine for the last few months was, I had a lot of free time. And I was looking into it, and actually went on and hired a researcher just to do it myself, because I said, if the media is going to totally neglect this guy, this history, these terrible trade deals, especially now, in the post-COVID-19 world, where we are going to actually have to deal with China and deal tough with China, which is what Donald Trump's -- that's his wheelhouse. That's his forte. He's the only guy to do it in the modern American history. That Joe Biden can sell this notion of, well, now we're going to be buy American, after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American dream to China, it's asinine. But I'm sitting there looking, whether it's Hunter Biden, whether it's Joe's brother, whether it's the sister -- the entire family has enriched themselves off of Joe Biden's publicly funded office. He won't release his documents from 30-something years in the Senate that are sitting at the University of Delaware. These aren't like private notes that he had as a citizen. This is while he was a senator in the United States, paid for by the American taxpayer, and, somehow, that's magically off-limits? Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook was not off-limits, according to Democrats. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP JR.: His high school yearbook. But Joe Biden's Senate papers, no, no, no, we can't touch this. BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. TRUMP JR.: so, it's about hypocrisy. It's about the double standard. And I called it \"Liberal Privilege,\" because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate... BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP JR.: ... because they can say one thing, do the other, and never get called on it. BARTIROMO: Hmm. Well, look, in the meantime, the critics of your father continue stepping it up. Just in the last two weeks, you had the mayor of New York actually painting a Black Lives Matter mural right outside of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City. This is where you work every day, right? TRUMP JR.: I... BARTIROMO: Do you pass this new mural here? Here is the shots of the mayor actually painting it right outside of Trump Tower. Your reaction? TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, it would be nice if the mayor actually did something to help the people of his city. He's busy there playing arts and crafts, but what has he actually done, other than oversee the destruction of New York City? The guy is -- it's literally gross incompetence, but he will go there for a photo op. What happened to the billion dollars, almost a billion dollars that were literally just lost on him and his wife's pet projects in New York City? Now he wants to defund the police, take $1 billion out of New York City's police department's budget. What do you think is going to happen with that? You see police officers retiring in droves. You want to stop senseless killings, like George Floyd? Guess what. The answer is not driving experienced, dedicated, loyal police officers into early retirement, and filling those -- that void with inexperienced people who may not have qualified otherwise, but are only getting the job because you need someone there. The guy doesn't know what he's doing. It's gross negligence. And, honestly, it's worse. It's just sheer incompetence. But, again, he can play arts and crafts for the photo-op, and it's as though all of the things and all of his failures are totally forgotten. But the media will give him that benefit of the doubt. BARTIROMO: Yes, but it's going -- it's going to keep going. And, in fact, de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, they all want mail-in voting. I want to talk to you about the, at because there was a city councilman among four people facing voter fraud charges in New Jersey. We have got umpteen stories of this delusion, mail-in ballots forcing election officials in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky to take two times as long to count votes in primary elections. How much of this election is going to be mail-in voting, do you think, Don? TRUMP JR.: Well, the Democrats would like it all to be mail-in voting. You have seen that. How often have Republicans won after the fact when people show up? Oh, look, magically I found a bucket of ballots in my car, they're all Democrats, four days later. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP JR.: It's truly disgusting. Over the weekend, we saw a cat, a cat that has been dead for 12 years, since the end of the Bush administration, got a voter regulation form in its home in Atlanta. BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness. TRUMP JR.: This is what's going on. A mail -- a mail clerk, someone who worked for the U.S. Postal Service... BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP JR.: ... pleaded guilty over the weekend for altering ballots. You think the Democrats aren't going to take full advantage of this? They are running around bragging that they were able to manipulate Trump rallies on TikTok. BARTIROMO: This is -- this is... TRUMP JR.: But they are not going to take advantage of mail-in voting. Democrats have even said it's terrible. But now, when it seems to... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP JR.: ... work against Trump, it's over. BARTIROMO: Yes. This is really serious stuff going into the election. You're right. All right, real quick, final question here, Don. Will you run for the mayor of New York? (LAUGHTER) TRUMP JR.: No. My only focus right now is making sure that my father wins in 2020. I see the policies that he's done. I see the economic results. We have seen it in the job numbers. Donald Trump did the impossible. Donald Trump accomplished the Holy Grail of American politics, raising the job numbers for people, raising the minimum wages for the lowest-income earners, watching their wages go up for the first time in modern history. Donald Trump did it all before. He's the guy that can do it again, clearly not swamp creature Joe Biden, who has an accomplishment record that is nonexistent in 50 years in Washington, D.C. BARTIROMO: So, maybe you will consider it after the president wins, then, Mayor of New York Donald Trump Jr. TRUMP JR.: I don't know. That's not really my kind of job, but who knows. BARTIROMO: All right, good to see you, Don. Thanks very much for being here. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. On July 20, Congress will return to Washington, with just one objective, hammering out the next stimulus bill. The bipartisan talks happening just as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of the month. Joining me right now is Republican Conference Chairman Senator John Barrasso. And, Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, R-WYO.: Thank you, Maria. BARTIROMO: Tell me what the plans are in terms of the CARES Act or the next part of the CARES Act, another stimulus plan. BARRASSO: Yes, there's a consensus we need to do another bill. That will be in the next couple of weeks. And let me just tell you what I believe needs to be in it. And I think your viewers will agree. Number one, it has to focus on getting people back to work and children back in school. Number two, it has to focus on saving lives. And, to me, that means more testing, better treatment, and then, of course, a vaccine. And, finally, we need to provide the liability insurance for our health care workers, for our mom-and-pop small businesses, and for our schools, so they can all open in a good way. Now, the Democrats have a proposal already. They passed it a month or so ago. And it's Nancy Pelosi living in handout heaven. It's direct checks to illegal immigrants. It's bailouts to big city and state pension plans that are run by Democrats. We're not going to do that. The focus of this bill has to be getting people back to work and paychecks back into their pockets. BARTIROMO: So, you're back on July 20, but then there's another recess beginning on August 8, right? Do you think, in that three-week period, you're going to get another stimulus plan passed and signed before you leave again August 8? BARRASSO: Well, there are a couple of deadlines, as you mentioned. One is the enhanced uninsured -- unemployment insurance benefits that run out on July 31. The other is the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been so successful. That runs out on August 8. That's helped keep about 50 million people on their -- on a payroll. And, in Wyoming, we had 13,000 of those loans. So, yes, there's an urgency to get this done, a lot of different things in the components of it. The question is, should it include additional relief checks for people who have still not been able to get back to work, certainly in hard-hit industries, whether it's the service industry, the hospitality industry? BARTIROMO: I see. BARRASSO: You know, we did that once before, but that was at people up to $95,000. We're looking at a lower number there. BARTIROMO: OK. BARRASSO: And then the unemployment insurance, as you raised, these are enhanced benefits, where they have been paying people $600 a week above their own state unemployment benefits. BARTIROMO: To make -- right. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: And some of them are making more to stay home, rather than to go to work. Stay with us, Senator. I want to ask you about masks and whether it should be a policy in that next act as well. We're talking with Senator Barrasso. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And we are back with Senator John Barrasso. And, Senator, I want to ask you about masks and whether or not that should be part of your CARES Act. There are some states that have made wearing a mask a policy. Should it be a national policy? BARRASSO: Well, let me just say, Maria, as a doctor, I want to congratulate President Trump for wearing his mask yesterday in public for the world to see. I think that sends a very strong message to everyone. We know that masks lower the risk of infection. We know it lowers the risk of death. And in this recent uptick, I just think it's even more important than ever. And when it comes to opening schools, these are going to be local decisions, state decisions. But I just think, in terms of good planning and good health, as people try to resume their normal lives, masks, personal hygiene, washing their hands, socially distancing, that's all part of this as we continue to fight this disease. BARTIROMO: All right. And real quick, on the next CARES Act, when you get back on the 20th, it doesn't sound like you're going to leave on August 8 without anything getting done. Should I assume we will have another -- another stimulus package in that three week period? BARRASSO: There is general agreement we need to work to that end, and we need to deal with the issues affecting our nation. There are still people who can't go back to work, through no fault of their own, because of the disease, because of maybe medical conditions. BARTIROMO: Right. BARRASSO: We need to make sure that they are cared for. But we cannot continue to pay people more to sit at home than to go to work. And we have so many help wanted signs around Wyoming and the country. BARTIROMO: Yes. BARRASSO: We need to do all we can to get people back to work and help them earn that paycheck BARTIROMO: Senator, real quick, before we go. The Senate unanimously passed that bipartisan bill to sanction Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong's authority, but the president hasn't signed it yet, right? What message does this send to the Communist Party? And will we see this get signed into law, do you think? BARRASSO: Well the communist Chinese are not our friends. There is no question about it. My message to the Chinese is, never again. Never again will we, as Americans, be dependent upon you, the communist Chinese, for medicines, for materials, for minerals. BARTIROMO: I see. BARRASSO: But what you're seeing here with what they're doing, Maria, with this group, with Hong Kong... BARTIROMO: Yes. BARRASSO: ... with their -- the Chinese incursion into the South China Sea, it's all a part of their big plan to the -- to be the military, the economic and the technological superpower of the world. BARTIROMO: I know. BARRASSO: We cannot allow it. BARTIROMO: Thanks. Senator, thank you. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": " Every cult has the same goal: the utter submission of its members. Cult members surrender everything. They give up their physical freedom \u2013 where they can go, who they can see, how they can dress. But more than that, they give up control of their minds. Cult leaders determine what their followers are allowed to believe, even in their most private thoughts. In order to do this, cults separate people from all they have known before. They force members to renounce their former lives, their countries and their customs. They allow no loyalty except to the cult. The first thing they attack \u2013 always \u2013 is the family. Families are always the main impediment to brainwashing and extremism. If you\u2019re going to control individuals \u2013 if you\u2019re going to transform free people into compliant robots \u2013 the first thing you must do is separate them from the ones who love them most. 'CULT MOM' LORI VALLOW'S EX-HUSBAND SUED HER YEARS AGO FOR ALLEGEDLY HIDING THEIR DAUGHTER: REPORT In 1932, Soviet authorities began promoting the story of a 13-year-old peasant boy called\u00a0Pavlik Morozov. Morozov, they claimed, had taken the supremely virtuous step of denouncing his own father to the secret police for committing counter-revolutionary acts. Once exposed as a traitor, the boy\u2019s father was executed by firing squad, supposedly for the safety of the state. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin elevated the boy to the status of a national hero for what he did. People wept in the streets when they heard his name. They worshipped him like a saint. Why are we telling you this? Because it\u2019s happening here. In the last 10 days, some of our most prominent citizens have sworn allegiance to a cult. Converts go by the term \u201callies.\u201d Like all cult members, they demand total conformity. They ritually condemn their own nation \u2013 its history, its institutions and symbols. It\u2019s flag. They denounce their own parents. If you\u2019ve been on social media recently, you\u2019ve likely seen videos that illustrate this \u2013 such as one showing a girl attacking her mother and father for the crime of insufficient loyalty to Black Lives Matter. Reporter Hanna Lustig of Insider.com wrote about that video, and strongly approved of it. What you just saw, Lustig wrote, is a young person \u201cmodeling the most important tenet of ally-ship.\u201d Modeling. Meaning, something done to encourage others to do the same. It\u2019s working. In a video of a 15-year-old from Louisville called Isabella \u2013 and there are many like her \u2013 the girl is shown crying and saying: \"I literally hate my family so much.\" She goes on to say her parents defended the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. And then she calls her parents racists, followed by an obscenity. \u201cI hate my family so much.\u201d Just a week ago, it would have been hard to imagine that. Now, Isabella is a social media star. Celebrities tweet their approval. She may have her own cult before long. But the revolution is young. Children attacking their parents is just the beginning. On CNN Friday, a man called Tim Wise told viewers that, going forward, parents must hurt their own children: Wise said: \u201cI think that the important thing for white parents to keep in the front of their mind is that if black children in this country are not allowed innocence and childhood without fear of being killed by police or marginalized in some other way, then our children don\u2019t deserve innocence. If Tamir Rice can be shot dead in a public park playing with a toy gun, something white children do all over this country every day without the same fear of being shot, if Tamir Rice can be killed then white children need to be told at least at the same age. If they can\u2019t be innocent, we don\u2019t get to be innocent.\u201d Your children are no longer allowed to be innocent, says Tim Wise. Happy childhoods are a sign of racism. The man saying this \u2013 and being affirmed by CNN anchors as he does \u2013 is a self-described \u201canti-racism activist.\u201d He has been saying things like this for a long time. More than once, Wise has suggested that he approves of violence against those who disagree. How does Tim Wise make a living? In part, by lecturing students. Your kids may have seen him speak. They\u2019ve almost certainly heard a lot from people like him. In America\u2019s schools, the revolution has been in progress for quite some time. Last February, to name one among countless examples, officials at schools in Rochester, N.Y., created a Black Lives Matter-themed lesson plan.\u00a0The teaching materials dismiss America\u2019s bedrock institutions \u2013 indeed, America itself \u2013 as inherently racist. Suggested questions for students include: \u201cHow does mass incarceration function as a mechanism of racialized social control?\u201d One specific racial group was singled out for exclusive blame.\u00a0The curriculum promoted a book titled, \u201cWhite Rage: The Unspoken Truth of our Racial Divide.\u201d In other words, children, there\u2019s a reason hatred and inequality exist: these people did it! That\u2019s what your kids are learning right now. Thursday, at Darien High School in Connecticut, Principal Ellen Dunn sent an email to parents promising to increase \u201cthe race-conscious education of our students.\u201d To do that, Dunn distributed materials from the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ironically, the SPLC is itself a hate group. That has been documented extensively. Now their agenda is the school\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s what your kids are learning. In Washington, D.C., an elementary school principal in the affluent northwest section of the city recently wrote a letter announcing: \u201cWe need more White parents to talk to their kids about race.\u00a0Especially now.\u201d The letter singled out \u201cWhite Staff and White community members,\u201d whom the principal alleged had committed \u201cboth macro- and micro-aggressions\u201d against \u201cStaff of Color.\u201d The principal did not specify what those crimes were. She didn\u2019t need to. Their skin color was their crime. This is a national theme. It\u2019s incredibly destructive and dangerous. Countless public schools are now using the 1619 Project from The New York Times as a curriculum. That project is the work of an out-of-the-closet racial extremist called Nikole Hannah Jones. Jones recently argued it\u2019s not violence to loot and burn stores \u2013 its justified. Her propaganda is now mandatory in public schools in Buffalo, Chicago, Newark and Washington. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Many parents understandably deeply resent this. It\u2019s deranged, its racist. Others don\u2019t. They\u2019re \u201callies.\u201d They\u2019ve joined in. One mother in London, where the cult is also spreading, posted a photo on Twitter of her daughter on blended knee, holding a sign declaring her \u201cprivilege.\u201d The Cultural Revolution has come to the West. What will the effects of this be? Years from now, how will that little girl with the sign remember her childhood? Her mother took Tim Wise\u2019s advice. She no longer has innocence. Will she be grateful for that? It\u2019s hard to imagine she will be. She\u2019ll more likely feel bitter and used. Because she has been used. Many will feel that way. Is there a single person who believes this moment we\u2019re living through will end in racial harmony? Is that even a goal anymore? It doesn\u2019t seem like it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It seems clear that many in power are pushing hard for racial division. For hatred. For violence. Let\u2019s pray they don\u2019t get what they want. Tribal conflict destroys countries faster than any plague. But keep in mind as this insanity continues that it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum. Every action provokes a reaction \u2013 that\u2019s physics. We don\u2019t know where this is going. We don\u2019t want to know. The cult members should stop now \u2013 immediately, before more innocents get hurt \u2013\u00a0and they will, if they don\u2019t.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee appeared on the Breakfast Club, a radio program that is widely regarded in the black community. The host, Charlamagne Tha God, pressed Biden on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be vice president\u2026 [Biden] then added: \u2018If you\u2019ve got a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or for Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Symone Sanders, a Biden senior adviser who is also black, said his comment in Friday\u2019s interview was \u2018made in jest.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s be clear about what the VP was saying,\u2019 Sanders tweeted. \u2018He was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump\u2019s any day. Period.\u2019\u201dRadio host says he wants results, not talk from Biden -\u00a0Mediaite: \u201cCharlamagne replied, \u2018It don\u2019t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact that I want something for my community.\u2019 Biden said his record in that area was \u2018second to none.\u2019 In a statement to Mediaite, Charlamagne said his response stood on its own. \u2018We have been loyal to Democrats for a long time, black people have invested a lot into that party and the return on investment has not been great,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018As Biden said in our brief interview when I asked him if Dems owe the black community ABSOLUTELY was his answer. So let\u2019s see what you got!!! Votes are Quid Pro Quo. You can\u2019t possibly want me to Fear Trump MORE than I want something for my people.\u2019\u201dTrump campaign calls Biden\u2019s line \u2018dehumanizing\u2019 -\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201c\u2018It is clear now more than ever, following these racist and dehumanizing remarks, that Joe Biden believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking,\u2019 Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement issued by \u2018Black Voices for Trump.\u2019 \u2018Frankly I would love to have a policy contrast with Joe Biden and President Trump on the things that we\u2019ve been able to accomplish,\u2019 [South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott] said in a conference call he and Pierson held with reporters. On Thursday, during a visit to a Ford plant that makes ventilators, Trump praised Henry Ford, who was openly racist and anti-Semitic. Trump said Ford has \u2018good bloodlines, good bloodlines, if you believe in that stuff.\u2019\u201dBernie backers not opening wallets for Biden -\u00a0WSJ: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has yet to unlock a key part of the party\u2019s fundraising base less than six months before Election Day:\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u2019s army of online small donors, a Wall Street Journal analysis found. About 60,000 people who gave to the Vermont senator during the Democratic primary had also chipped in to Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign by the end of April, according to the Journal\u2019s analysis of Federal Election Commission data filed this week. That group amounted to just under 3% of the roughly 2.2 million total Sanders donors the Journal identified in public filings.\u201dReade\u2019s work as expert witness called into doubt -\u00a0NYT: \u201cDefense lawyers in California are reviewing criminal cases in which\u00a0Tara Reade, the former Senate aide who has accused Joseph R. Biden Jr. of sexual assault, served as an expert witness on domestic violence, concerned that she misrepresented her educational credentials in court. Then known as\u00a0Alexandra McCabe, Ms. Reade testified as a government witness in Monterey County courts for nearly a decade, describing herself as an expert in the dynamics of domestic violence who had counseled hundreds of victims. But lawyers who had faced off against her in court began raising questions about the legitimacy of her testimony, and the verdicts that followed, after news reports this week that Antioch University had disputed her claim of receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree from its Seattle campus.\u201dLawyer drops -\u00a0NY Post: \u201cJoe Biden sex assault accuser\u00a0Tara Reade\u00a0and her lawyer have parted ways. Attorney\u00a0Douglas Wigdor\u00a0announced the split Friday just weeks after Reade, a former Senate staffer of Biden\u2019s, hired the high-profile sex-harassment lawyer. In a statement, the Manhattan litigator did not provide a reason for the decision but said it had nothing to do with the veracity of Reade\u2019s claims that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden assaulted her in the 1990s. \u2018Our firm no longer represents Tara Reade. Our decision, made on May 20, is by no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms. Reade,\u2019 Wigdor wrote before defending his former client\u2019s poor treatment in the media.\u201dTHE RULEBOOK: MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS\u201cThe importance of commerce, in the view of revenue alone, must effectually guard it against the enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor, by the urgent calls of public necessity.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 60TIME OUT: IN MEMORIUMIf the United States of America was the beneficiary of the most advantaged birth of any nation in history, our passage into adulthood more than made up for it in terms of suffering.Monday is Memorial Day, an opportunity to decorate the graves and remember all those who laid down their lives in defense of this nation, \u201cthe last best hope of earth.\u201d It is our duty and privilege as the beneficiaries of their sacrifices.But the observance began with the memory of the Civil War dead, first among the widows of Confederate soldiers and then taken up by the survivors of the Union side. Initially known as Decoration Day, the holiday came into its current form in 1971.The first 85 years of our national history was a breathless sprint forward. Our meager forces twice defeated the most powerful empire in the world with minimal casualties, the size of the new nation had more than tripled and our wealth was multiplying even faster. The race was on.But the unfinished work of our founding \u2013 the elimination of slavery \u2013 would stop that sprint. What Americans North and South could not know in 1861 was just how painful completing that task would be.The scope of the slaughter and magnitude of the loss defies even the understanding of the Americans who endured in the great wars of the 20th\u00a0century. To try to grasp the scale, imagine if almost 8 million Americans today had been killed in a war.But numbers will not answer in a matter like this one. So, we turn to poetry.Herman Melville\u00a0was deeply affected by the war, which had drawn in so many of his friends and relatives.\u00a0 He, too old by then for service, visited the front himself and saw the carnage firsthand.The battle of Shiloh in April 1862 was the first battle to reveal the magnitude of the horrors to come. A Confederate ambush led to an eventual Union victory that claimed nearly 24,000 dead and wounded in less than two days. The terrible, ravening beast of modern warfare had been loosed on our land.The story of a frontier church where the casualties from both sides lay dying stirred Melville:Shiloh: A RequiemSkimming lightly, wheeling still,The swallows fly lowOver the field in clouded days,The forest-field of Shiloh\u2014Over the field where April rainSolaced the parched ones stretched in painThrough the pause of nightThat followed the Sunday fightAround the church of Shiloh\u2014The church so lone, the log-built one,That echoed to many a parting groanAnd natural prayerOf dying foemen mingled there\u2014Foemen at morn, but friends at eve\u2014Fame or country least their care:(What like a bullet can undeceive!)But now they lie low,While over them the swallows skim,And all is hushed at Shiloh.[Ed. note: Halftime Report will not be published on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.]Flag on the play?\u00a0- Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\u00a0PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(186 electoral votes)\u00a0Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(249 electoral votes)[Full rankings\u00a0here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\u00a044.2 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a052.6 percentNet Score:\u00a0-8.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2191\u00a00.2 points\u00a0\u00a0[Average includes: American Research Group: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 48% disapprove.]\u00a0WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The latest Fox News Poll finds voters trust Biden to do a better job than Trump on health care by 17 points, coronavirus by 9, and relations with China by 6. Trump is trusted more on the economy by a slim 3-point margin. \u2026 Eighty-eight percent are concerned about coronavirus spreading and 78 percent feel the economy is in bad shape. There has been a seismic shift in views on the economy since the pandemic. In January, voters rated economic conditions positively by an 11-point margin\u2026 Today, views are negative by 58 points:\u00a0 20 percent excellent/good vs. 78 percent only fair/poor. \u2026 In the 2020 ballot test, Biden leads Trump by 48-40 percent. \u2026 However, given that 11 percent are undecided or plan to vote for someone else, neither candidate hits 50 percent support. The race could go either way.\u201dTrump on another possible outbreak: \u2018We\u2019re not closing our country\u2019 -\u00a0NY Post: \u201cPresident Trump said the US will not shut down again if a second wave of coronavirus infections emerges. \u2018We\u2019re not going close the country,\u2019 Trump told reporters Thursday while touring a Ford plant in Michigan. \u2018We\u2019re going to put out the fires. Whether it\u2019s an ember or a flame, we\u2019re going put it out, but we\u2019re not closing our country.\u2019 The commander-in-chief said there\u2019s a \u2018very distinct possibility\u2019 that the deadly virus starts to spread again as states lift lockdown measures meant to control it. But he suggested that officials will address new outbreaks individually rather than impose widespread restrictions like those that have hammered the US economy in the past two months. \u2018This is a country that\u2019s meant to be open, not closed,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018I want it open, and we\u2019re going to open, and if there\u2019s a fire, an ember, a flame someplace, we put it out.\u2019\u201dTrump wears mask, but not in front of cameras -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cPresident Trump on Thursday brought a mask with him to tour of a Ford plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., but said he didn\u2019t \u2018want to give the press the pleasure of seeing\u2019 him wear it while he was on camera. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the back area I did have a mask on. I had goggles and a mask right back there.\u2019 While speaking without a face covering -- next to others wearing masks -- the president added that masks were not necessary in the front of the plant, where he was standing. \u2018They\u2019re not necessary here. Everybody\u2019s been tested, in fact I was tested this morning so it\u2019s not necessary,\u2019 the president said. \u2026 When asked if it was true that it wasn\u2019t required that the president wear a mask, Ford\u2019s CEO,\u00a0Jim Hackett, told reporters, \u2018It\u2019s up to him.\u2019\u201dAlberta: \u2018Life at the Trump Tailgate\u2019 -\u00a0Politico: \u201cFor the masses gathered on the side of the road, the sight of a presidential motorcade\u2014and the knowledge that Donald Trump himself has come to their backyard, to visit the local Ford plant and pay homage to the old \u2018Arsenal of Democracy\u2019\u2014is sufficient to distract from the suffering of the day. Country music blares from the back of a parked pickup truck. Giddy customers fork over $5 bills and pull MAGA shirts over their outfits. One man hoists a Betsy Ross-era flag from his fishing pole, with a naked brunette doll\u2014'Governor Half-Whit!\u2019 he cries, echoing a presidential putdown\u2014dangling from a noose. \u2026 With no sports to watch, politics are the only game in town\u2014and this is Trump\u2019s tailgate, an experience as unique as the times, the closest thing to one of the president\u2019s signature rallies at a moment when large gatherings have been banned.\u201dFlorida shapes up as ground zero for GOP in 2024 -\u00a0Politico: \u201cEven as attention focuses on the rapidly intensifying 2020 campaign and the unprecedented complications presented by Covid-19\u2019s double-barreled health crisis and economic catastrophe, there\u2019s another race already in progress. A number of well-known players in the GOP\u2014former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations\u00a0Nikki Haley\u00a0and Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence, among them\u2014are considered leading contenders to succeed Trump should he win a second term. But Florida, which also boasts Senator\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0(who many expect to try and avenge his 2016 failure) and Rep.\u00a0Matt Gaetz, a nationally known congressman and huge Trump ally, already looks like a uniquely consequential proving ground for several of the most likely Republican aspirants to the Oval Office. And it is captivating political insiders who see the contours of a still distant contest emerging in dramatic ways.\u201dGOP SOUNDS ALARM ON MCSALLYPolitico: \u201cSenior political advisers to President Donald Trump warned Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0Thursday that Republican Sen.\u00a0Martha McSally\u00a0is falling dangerously behind in the critical swing state of Arizona. Trump\u2019s campaign team was meeting with the president at the White House to discuss the state of play in a handful of battleground states. Toward the end of the meeting, Trump pulled McConnell, who was at the White House to meet with him on another matter, into the Roosevelt Room. The discussion turned to Arizona, where recent polling has shown Trump and McSally trailing. Trump himself said he was concerned about McSally, according to three people familiar with the discussion. His political advisers told McConnell about recent survey numbers in Arizona and stressed she was losing to Democrat and former astronaut Mark Kelly.\u201dLoeffler isn\u2019t going anywhere -\u00a0Politico: \u201cKelly Loeffler\u00a0is behind in the polls and best known for her fortuitously timed stock trades. But the Georgia Republican insisted during a 25-minute interview that she\u2019s not going anywhere. \u2018Not only am I not dropping out, but I'm gonna win,\u2019 Loeffler said Thursday. \u2018And no one's going to intimidate me into thinking that that's the right course for our party, for our state, for our country. I'm working hard to help reelect the president. I'm working hard to win my seat and keep the Senate in Republican hands.\u2019 Loeffler\u2019s five months as a senator have not been easy. She\u2019s facing attacks from the left and right for selling millions of dollars in stocks after receiving a private briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. What\u2019s more, she\u2019s fighting off a serious challenge from Rep.\u00a0Doug Collins\u00a0(R-Ga.) \u2014 a strong ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 who is ahead in most recent public polling.\u201dPhiladelphia elections judge admits taking bribes to inflate vote counts -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cA former Democratic elections judge has pleaded guilty for his role in accepting bribes to cast fraudulent ballots and certifying false voting results in primary elections in Philadelphia, prosecutors announced Thursday.\u00a0Domenick J. Demuro, 73, admitted that while serving as an elected municipal Judge of Elections, he accepted bribes in exchange for adding ballots for certain candidates on the voting machines in his jurisdiction and for including the fraudulent ballots in official tallies during the 2014, 2015 and 2016 primary elections in Philadelphia. Demuro further admitted that a local political consultant paid him money to add votes for the consultant\u2019s preferred candidates in different federal, state and local elections. Demuro said the votes he added in exchange for the political consultant\u2019s bribes fraudulently increased the number of votes recorded and tallied for the consultant\u2019s preferred candidates.\u201dFlorida probe finds no fraud in 2018 -\u00a0Politico: \u201cA Trump election conspiracy theory has fallen apart after Florida\u2019s law enforcement agency said it had found no widespread voter fraud in the 2018 races for Senate and governor. President Donald Trump had complained repeatedly about election \u2018fraud\u2019 and theft in heavily populated, Democrat-rich Broward and Palm Beach counties, which had slowly but erratically updated their vote totals after polls closed on Election Day. With each updated tally, Republican candidates\u00a0Rick Scott, who was running for U.S. Senate, and\u00a0Ron DeSantis, in a bid for the governor\u2019s mansion, saw their margins of victory narrow. Both races ultimately went to recounts. It\u2019s common for election margins to change as more ballots are counted, but Scott, who was governor at the time, claimed without evidence that the counts reeked of Democratic fraud, a conspiracy theory Trump amplified on Twitter. Scott called for an investigation. Trump backed him up.\u201dTRUMP: GOVERNORS MUST ALLOW WORSHIP SERVICESFox News: \u201cPresident Trump on Friday announced that new Centers for Disease Control guidance will classify houses of worship as \u2018essential,\u2019 as he called on governors to allow them to open \u2018right now\u2019 after being closed during the coronavirus lockdowns. Trump announced the policy for churches, synagogues and mosques, during a short briefing at the White House. \u2018The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now--for this weekend,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018If they don't do it, I will override the governors.\u2019 \u2018In America, we need more prayer not less,\u2019 Trump said. The announcement comes after Trump has been hearing concerns of faith leaders who are unable to hold Sunday services due to coronavirus restrictions at a time when their parishioners are grappling with the crisis. Families may be grieving the loss of loved ones from the virus or struggling with job loss but unable to seek respite in their places of worship.\u201dMore cash for vaccine -\u00a0NYT: \u201cExpanding its pursuit of an inoculation against the coronavirus, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday it would provide \u2018up to $1.2 billion\u2019 to the drug company AstraZeneca to develop a potential vaccine from a laboratory at Oxford University. The deal with AstraZeneca is the fourth and by far the largest vaccine research agreement that the department has disclosed. The money will pay for a Phase 3 clinical trial of a potential vaccine in the United States this summer with about 30,000 volunteers. The H.H.S. statement said the agency and AstraZeneca \u2018are collaborating to make available at least 300 million doses,\u2019 and projected that the first doses could be available as early as October. That is a very accelerated, ambitious timetable. Most public health experts and scientists caution that a viable, mass-produced vaccine would probably not be available until sometime next year, at the earliest. Plus, billions of doses would be needed around the world.\u201dNoonan: What we\u2019ve learned -\u00a0WSJ: \u201cPeople have suffered. They\u2019ve been afraid. The ground on which they stand has shifted. Many have been reviewing their lives, thinking not only of \u2018what\u2019s important\u2019 or \u2018what makes me happy\u2019 but \u2018what was I designed to do?\u2019 They\u2019ve been conducting a kind of internal life review, reflecting on the decision that seemed small and turned out to be crucial, wondering about paths not taken, recognizing strokes of luck. They\u2019ve been thinking about their religious faith or lack of it, about their relationships. Phone calls have been longer, love more easily expressed, its lack more admitted. It has been a dramatic time. We have stopped and thought about our lives, and our society\u2019s arrangements. We have applauded together, for the first time, those whose jobs kept our towns up and operating, from nurses to truckers. We\u2019ve rethought not only what is \u2018essential\u2019 but who is important. All this will change you as a nation. Here is what I am certain of. We will emerge a plainer people in a plainer country, and maybe a deeper one.

            "article_content": "Former White House chief of staff reacts to president calling off negotiations until after election on 'Your World' This is a rush transcript from \u201cYour World\" October 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0 All right, talks off and stocks off. And I mean way off. No sooner, less than an hour ago, when we got word from the White House, that that's it, the president has had it with no progress on these talks that he says are going nowhere, that he's putting them off until after the election, at the soonest. And that depends, I would imagine, if he gets reelected himself. For now, Wall Street heard that and tanked, and continued tanking, Boeing and airline-related stocks, particularly hoping to see some sort of deal that will give them flight again, now grounded, all grounded, and all on concerns that these talks are now done. To John Roberts at the White House on whether this is a great negotiating tactic, or they really are done -- John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Yes, not clear about that. I mean, it would seem, at least at the moment, that they're done. But this is going to have a big impact on businesses that we're looking for more PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, people who are looking for those $1,200 checks to go into their bank account, as you mentioned, the airlines who are about to furlough tens of thousands of employees. But the president tweeting out earlier today that he has instructed the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and Steven Mnuchin, to cease and desist from further negotiations until after the election in a long series of tweets here. And I will read along. He says: \"Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 trillion to bail out poorly run high-crime Democrat states, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 trillion. And, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request and looking to the future of our country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election, when immediately after I win, we will pass a major stimulus bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and small businesses.\" He continues: \"I have asked Mitch McConnell not to delay, but instead focus full-time on approving my outstanding nominee for the United States Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. Our economy is doing very well. The stock market is at record levels\" -- well, it was -- \"jobs and unemployment also coming back in record numbers. We are leading the world in economic recovery,and the best is yet to come.\" Again, it really is difficult to tell if the president is serious about this, or if this is just a negotiating tactic. I mean, there's not a lot of time left between now and the election. Mark Meadows and Steven Mnuchin have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi for weeks now. They have pretty much -- and Chad Pergram was talking about this earlier this afternoon -- reached a ceiling in terms of the Republicans, reached a floor in terms of the Democrats. There's a gap of about $600 billion in there. There's no signs that Nancy Pelosi is willing to come down further, no sign that the White House is willing to go higher. So it could be, Neil, that until November the 4th, one way or the other, or who knows -- because we do not know when we will find out who's going to win this election because of the mail-in ballots and all of the leeway that these individual states are giving in county those mail-in ballots. It may be some time before people who are really hurting get a little more money in their pockets. We will see -- Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 No, you're right. If that thing is delayed, so too getting these talks going again, if they get going again. John Roberts, thank you very much. ROBERTS:\u00a0 Thanks, Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 Well, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve weighed into this debate, before we knew the president put the kaput on the talks themselves, saying that stimulus is needed here, and better to err on the side of too much than risk offering too little. Again, a moot point at this point. To Susan Li on the fallout from all of this. Hey, Susan. SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Neil, so the Dow dropped 400 points after President Trump put an end to stimulus talks, making the announcement via Twitter, as John Roberts pointed out. So, Wall Street was hoping for something after some hopeful signs that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had several conversations over the past week, and also strong words, as you mentioned, from the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, today, predicting what he calls tragic risks for the U.S. economy if there wasn't any extra stimulus. There was a $600 billion gap between what the Republicans wanted and what the Democrats had passed. And the Democrats are proposing $600 more in extra weekly unemployment benefits. Compare that to the $400 for Republicans. More than $400 billion for local governments. That was twice as much as the GOP. And another round of $1,200 stimulus checks. But this accelerated the heavy sell-off in technology names. Think of the Apples, Amazon, Microsoft, and even high flyer Tesla. Some of these tech names were already down big after reports that the House Judiciary Antitrust Committee was possibly recommending a breakup of some of these names and more oversight regulation of these tech companies that may have too much power and influence over American lives. Now, Wall Street has also been on edge about a long-contested election coming off the worst September in nearly 10 years. And some say, if there is a blue wave in November, with Democrats in the White House and both chambers of Congress, that could actually increase the chances of a large fiscal spending package, but only in the new year, Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 Susan Li, thank you very, very much. In the meantime here, well, hope denied and promises denied. So, what happens now? To Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with, I would imagine, some folks who were a tad surprised by this development -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Well, the first thing I heard from people here on Capitol Hill, people were starting to ask, why would they make that announcement while the markets were still open? They started to question the wisdom of that. Also, I started to hear from Republicans saying, what about these vulnerable Republican senators facing these competitive reelection bids in swing states? How is this going to impact it? Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has weighed in on what the president announced this afternoon. Here's what she had to say, Pelosi: \"Today, once again, President Trump showed his true colors, putting himself first, at the expense of the country, with the full complicity of the GOP members of Congress.\" She also said: \"Clearly, the White House is in complete disarray. Sadly, they're rejecting the urgent warnings of Fed Chairman Powell today. Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and for businesses.\" Now, keep in mind that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, they have been negotiating some in-person, mostly by phone of late, after the COVID outbreak here on Capitol Hill, to try to get a deal. But, as John Roberts alluded to, those numbers, that $2.2 trillion to $1.4, $1.6 trillion that Republicans were pushing, they have never really gotten any closer. And in some respects, even though they were talking on almost a daily basis here by telephone, these talks have not moved at all since May. It intensified in the past couple of days, because you hit October 1. That's when all of these layoffs were starting to happen. And that kind of focused refocused these talks. Keep in mind that a lot of folks on Capitol Hill said that they thought that, after the president got sick, that that might augment this, maybe push the administration to get a deal, maybe have a win right before the election. But that does not seem to be the case right now. And I heard from Dean Phillips. He's a Republican -- excuse me -- a Democratic freshman from Minnesota. And here's what he said. He's been trying to work out a bipartisan agreement across the aisle for several weeks now. He said: \"It's confounding and unconscionable that the president would suddenly order a cessation of negotiations. People cannot afford more delays.\" And, as John Roberts alluded to, more delays. They're probably not going to get this done any time until after the election. And that was always the marker here, that, if things had not moved since May, the only time that things would move would be after the election. Now, according to the president, the focus, at least in the Senate, is going to be on confirming Amy Coney Barrett. She goes before the Judiciary Committee next week -- Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 You raised a good point about the timing of all those in the middle of a market day. The president must have known that it would have the reaction it did, and the markets would tank. But you also get into the possibility here that a lot of the airlines, which were trying to hold off on layoffs, now will just go full-throttle, no pun intended, on continuing with them, because that's at least 30 days away, if that. PERGRAM:\u00a0 Absolutely. And that's the concern from a lot of these members of Congress, because they thought there was a chance they could have something, maybe vote on it next week, week after that, do it right before the election. But, again, the metric never really moved, Neil. That's the inherent problem here. As I always say, it's about the math. If the Democrats came down too low, they were going to lose Democratic votes. If Republicans came up too high, they were going to lose GOP votes, and they could never hit that sweet spot right in the middle. That was the problem with these negotiations between Pelosi and Mnuchin. CAVUTO:\u00a0 No, you did say that from the outset. I'm just wondering whether -- and I was reading this with John, and it's a crazy notion -- as to whether this might be a negotiating tactic to get the two sides to speed something together. I have seen it in the China talks. I saw it in the Canada and the Mexico talks. Could it be something like that? Or am I getting to inside the black helicopter crowd here? PERGRAM:\u00a0 Here's the -- here's the main problem with that. Under normal circumstances, if you had members of Congress here on a daily basis, that might amplify the pressure. You don't have many members here. The House of Representatives is out. Mitch McConnell canceled the Senate schedule, the floor schedule, until the 19th. You will have -- you won't even have the full Judiciary Committee here next week for the Barrett hearings. And when you have members of Congress in the building, even during a pandemic, they talk, they get together, they trade horses, they trade ideas. The fact that that does not exist right now probably diminishes the chances of getting a deal. CAVUTO:\u00a0 Chad Pergram, thank you very much, my friend. On the right of your screen, you're watching the former Vice President Joe Biden. He's arrived in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He will be making a speech there. We got word as well that he has tested negative for the coronavirus. I believe this is the third time that we have got an indication of that, a little more than a week. Again, we're going to be following what he says. Will he have any response to these developments in the talks that were suddenly stopped by the president today? In the meantime, I want to go to Leon Panetta, of course, former defense secretary, chief of staff, so much more, his view of these fast-moving developments on the Hill. Leon, what do you make of the president pulling the rug out on these -- on these talks? The two sides, I guess, were not as close as we thought. They were kind of in the same math position here, but at least they were talking. Now that's gone. What do you think? LEON PANETTA, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:\u00a0 I don't see -- I don't think it makes a lot of sense, to be truthful. You have got -- you have got the economy in a recession. It's going to go deeper in a recession, with all of these layoffs, all of that happening before the election. That can't be good for the president. You have got a situation where people are still concerned about COVID-19. The president said, don't be afraid of COVID-19. By his actions today, they're going to be damn afraid of COVID-19, because there's not going to be any assistance made available. And, besides that, the negotiations, yes, they have gone on for a long period of time, but they had narrowed their differences. And, frankly, having negotiated those kinds of packages, you always wind up splitting the difference and going home. And I think that was going to be probably the next step, if he had allowed these negotiations to go forward. CAVUTO:\u00a0 I'm just wondering, if it were to wait until after the election -- and, of course, the president's making the assumption he wins. If the other guy wins, Joe Biden wins, he will want something decidedly more generous, something along the lines that Nancy Pelosi wanted, closer to $2.2 to $2.3 trillion. So he could be cutting off his nose and wrecking his whole face, couldn't he? (LAUGHTER) PANETTA:\u00a0 Well, yes. I think the problem is, if Biden wins, there probably will not be a package that will be approved by the Congress. You will probably have to wait until the beginning of the year. And people are going to be hurting. CAVUTO:\u00a0 But it would be a much more expensive package, right? And I think that's the one thing I would think the president would want to avoid. But let's say we don't, Leon, get anything together. Is it your sense here that it's a worthy subject for the vice presidential candidates to mention tomorrow, the response? Because Republicans have always said, we have poured trillions into this. The issue isn't a lack of money. If anything, we poured maybe too much money, and it's gone into areas we didn't intend, but that it isn't this deal that matters. It's all the other spending that matters that has not yielded the results we thought. What do you think? PANETTA:\u00a0 Well, Neil, having -- having worked on budgets, and having worked on a budget that ultimately produced a balanced budget, I remain very concerned about the fact that the deficit is escalating to almost $3.7 trillion. But we are in a crisis. We're in an economic crisis, and we're in a pandemic. This is an emergency situation. And we know what the consequences will be if we do nothing, which is that people will be laid off, people will be hurting, people are out of jobs, they won't be getting any kind of aid. I mean, this is not America. We have got to take the step -- as the chairman of the Fed has said, we have got to take the necessary steps here to help our economy. Yes, it's going to cost money, but we all knew that that was going to be the case. And better to go ahead with a package that provides some relief to millions of Americans than to basically hold them hostage until after the election. That doesn't make any sense. CAVUTO:\u00a0 Would you recommend -- when the president was diagnosed or tested positive for the virus, Leon, many Democrats were wishing him well, from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, even President Barack Obama himself, saying their thoughts and prayers were with him. It seems like all that's gone now, that it's back to war here. PANETTA:\u00a0 Well, I hope not. I mean, I think we all have to wish that the president gets well, as a result of this. Look, when the president gets ill with COVID-19, my concern is that it raises national security implications, and that, now with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other members of the Joint Chiefs going into quarantine because of COVID-19, what's happening with the staff at the White House, here we are in a situation where we're facing a number of crises, the pandemic, a recession. We're facing a polarized country. We're facing the concern about election integrity. And now we have got the leadership of the country almost devastated. This is a vulnerable situation for the United States. And this is the moment, very frankly, where we need leadership in order to be able to put us in the right direction. CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, thank you very, very much, Leon Panetta. Good catching up with you. Leon, of course, the former defense secretary, former CIA director, former White House chief of staff, so, so much more, former OMB director. I forgot about that. Again, the collective stunned surprise out of those in both parties here that these talks have been stopped. Again, we will see how those in the financial community digest all of this. Leon was also talking about some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff quarantining themselves, out of an abundance of caution, because of their proximity to some key figures who have since tested positive for the virus, including the president. Anyway, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which includes the heads of the Army and the Navy and the Air Force, they have all tested negative for the virus. So, there is that. We will have more after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Joe Biden is in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He will be making remarks there very shortly. Pennsylvania's a must-win state. He wants to reverse that state from slipping away from Hillary Clinton four weeks ago -- four years ago, I should say. The latest Monmouth poll of the state has Biden up by about a dozen points at this moment. Mark Meredith with more from Gettysburg. Hey, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hey, Neil. Good afternoon. Any moment now, we do expect to hear from Joe Biden here. He just arrived in Gettysburg. He's expected to deliver an address focused on unity. This is a speech he says he's been working out for quite some time. And we have seen some of his supporters make their way out here. His motorcade just arrived. As you can imagine, the Biden campaign putting a lot of time and resources into Pennsylvania, state the president one four years ago, but also a state that they think they have a real shot at winning this time around, as they have been going up against President Trump. A new poll out today from Monmouth University shows registered voters supporting Biden by double digits, with 54 percent going for Biden. This survey was two survey was taken within the last few days. And it is a bit higher than the overall average that we have been seeing for the last several weeks here in Pennsylvania. Biden's normally been leading by about six points. Meantime, the Biden campaign is also relying on one of its most high- profile surrogates to get the base excited, to help get out the vote. I'm talking about former first lady Michelle Obama. She had put out a new video message in which she called on Americans to rally behind her husband's former running mate. And last night, while Biden was in Florida, it was interesting. He was telling the supporters that were out there, he considered calling President Trump while he was in the hospital with COVID, but decided not to do that, thinking it was going to be a little bit intrusive. As for the speech that we're going to be hearing from Joe Biden, it is a beautiful day here in Pennsylvania. But it is not going to be a big crowd in the audience. This instead is a speech that appears mostly to be for the cameras. His supporters that have been out here, very eager to see him as the motorcade drove by, but no indication, Neil, that they will be getting close to the candidate himself -- Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Mark, thank you very, very much. As Mark was wrapping up there, we're getting confirmation from a subcommittee that's looking into antitrust issues with some of the biggest tech names on the planet. And it's corralled them all, with strong language here, saying right now that Amazon has monopoly over third-party sellers, and it's engaged in extensive anti-competitive conduct of its own in the treatment of such sellers. It has said the same right now about the social networking giant Facebook, saying that it has maintained dominance by identifying rivals and then copying and acquiring or killing them. It has similar remarks to make about Apple and a host of other big tech players. The push has been on in the Democratic House right now to rein these guys in. Some have even said break them up. As if it wasn't tough enough for technology today, the Specter of this could make things worse. Stay with us. You're watching YOUR WORLD. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:\u00a0 Here we go again. Hurricane Delta is now a Category 4 storm. It could hit land as a Category 5, the governors of Louisiana and Alabama both declaring states of emergencies. This is the 25th big storm of the season. More after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, the big vice presidential debate is on. We're keeping an eye on that, as the candidates, the vice presidential candidates, get ready for that. Man, oh, man, talk about lots of things to talk about. Also waiting on Joe Biden. He is in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He will no doubt be responding to these latest developments about canceled stimulus talks, where the president stands, the whole mask thing, whether the president is doing enough to address the COVID-19 issue. Having said all of that, Hillary Vaughn with a sort of a prep on what they're looking at for Salt Lake City tomorrow, the site of the big V.P. debate -- Hillary. HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hey, Neil. Well, this debate has extra safety precautions. And one of those will be a Plexiglas wall dividing Harris and Pence. We got an idea of what that will look like from Senator Lindsey Graham's Senate race debate over the weekend. Tomorrow night, the glass wall will divide Vice President Mike Pence and V.P. nominee Kamala Harris and keep them over 12 feet apart. Both candidates have been busy holding mock debates preparing for tomorrow night. Axios reports, for the Harris team, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg is playing Pence. And for the Pence team, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is playing Harris. Harris promised to prosecute the case against President Trump. But now that Trump is battling coronavirus, her strategy has shifted a bit. Her team is now planning on softening their attacks to make them less personal, according to Axios. But debate prep partner Pete Buttigieg says today, one of her strategies will not be to fact-check Pence play by play. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), FORMER MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA:\u00a0 It's an ability to deliver lines with a high degree of confidence, whether they're true or not. But, of course, saying something with a straight face doesn't make it true. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUGHN:\u00a0 Pence has been ramping up research on his candidate, the campaign telling Axios Pence has been reviewing mounds of material on Harris. Part of the strategy to get through to voters will be putting Harris' record on display. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE CORTES, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:\u00a0 She was literally for 2019 the most liberal member of the United States Senate, even to the left of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. So there is a wide divide between these two. And I expect Vice President Pence to particularly press her on some of her more radical ideas. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUGHN:\u00a0 And, Neil, Biden today in a fund-raising e-mail looked back at his time participating in vice presidential debates, reminiscing about his debate against Paul Ryan in 2012 that he credits for coining his personal catchphrase, \"That's a bunch of malarkey.\" So, maybe Harris will take a cue from that, and use tomorrow night to come up with her own catchphrase -- Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, thank you very much, Hillary. Of course, Joe Biden's famous debate and the one that remains the highest rated vice presidential debate was his exchange with Sarah Palin back in 2008. The ticket went on, obviously, to win that year. But a lot of people gave Sarah Palin high marks for her strong performance at that time. So, again, it gets a little bit more attention, given the fact that this is Kamala Harris part of this, the first woman to be in that role in a vice presidential debate role since Sarah Palin. The fallout, what we're likely to see and what our guests see as things that we could see, Emily Larsen of The Washington Examiner, Michael Starr Hopkins, Democratic strategist. Michael, let's begin with you and the pressure on Kamala Harris, of course, the first woman in that role of since Sarah Palin. Now, I don't know whether she will come out and say, \"Can I call your Mike?\" at the start of this. But I do want to get your take on the recent developments, particularly with the president's positive testing for the coronavirus, whether that might dial things back a little bit. What do you think? MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:\u00a0 I do. And I think it's -- what it's going to do even more so is draw a very distinct line between President Trump and Mike Pence. Mike Pence, for all of my political differences with him, is very much a sobering character when you compare him to Donald Trump. I think that's going to be amplified when you see him on the debate stage tomorrow. I think he's going to have to answer a lot of questions about Donald Trump's behavior and Donald Trump's decision to end the COVID discussions. So, I think this goes back to being a referendum on Trump and, to some degree, allows Kamala Harris off the hook. CAVUTO:\u00a0 You know, Emily, on that point of the canceled discussions, there might be a strategy to it. There might be wisdom. Maybe the president group frustrated by the talks making no real progress. It's hard to say. But he's handed a grenade to Vice President Pence tomorrow night. And I'm sure the vice president doesn't welcome that. But how do you think this move is going to play out tomorrow night? EMILY LARSEN, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:\u00a0 Well, this is definitely something that Kamala Harris is going to point out, and not only that, but also the fact that President Trump got coronavirus, that gives her a perfect way to bring up the coronavirus issue. I mean, I think that Kamala Harris is on the winning ticket right now. They are ahead in the polls. It looks like her task, because of that, is, she needs to deliver for the people who are hoping to see her aggressive style come in. She's going to be on the offense, but not so much that it backfires. And so, in the last debate, President Trump was frequently interrupting, so much to the point where that backfired on him. And that -- she doesn't want to fall into that same kind of trap and give President Trump and the Republicans a reason to call her nasty or some other kind of trope like that. So -- but I think, also, the fact that there's going to be Plexiglas the stage, I talked to one strategist today who said that that is a perfect way for her not only to bring up the coronavirus issue, but it's also a visually striking way to show the divide in the country and the two candidates. CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, I'm rudely interrupting both of you fine folks. I apologize for that, but Joe Biden is speaking in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. We will look into this for at least a little while. Joe Biden. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 ... perhaps the most consequential battle on American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg, three days of violence, three days of carnage, 50,000 casualties wounded, captured, missing or dead over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years. But the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved. Slavery would be abolished. Government by -- of, by and for the people would not perish from the earth. And freedom would be born anew in our land. There is no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg to talk about the cost of division, about how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe, in this moment, we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes, the end of slavery, widening equality, pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom. His words would live ever after. We hear them in our heads. We know them in our hearts. We draw on them when we see hope in hours of darkness. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought fourth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all man are created equal. Here, on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln reimagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division and the meaning of sacrifice. He believed in the rescue, redemption, and rededication of the Union, all this in a time not just of ferocious division, but of widespread death, structural inequity, and fear of the future. And he taught us this. A house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided. But that, my friends, can no longer be. We are facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have too bright a future to have it shipwrecked on the shoals of anger and hate and division. As we stand here today, a century-and-a-half later after Gettysburg, we should consider again what can happen whether equal justice is denied, when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I'm concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but, rather, they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting partisan warfare. Instead of treating each other's party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country, a spirit to being able to work with one another. When I say that -- and I have been saying it for two years now -- I'm accused of being naive. I'm told maybe that is the way things used to work, Joe, but they can't work that way anymore. Well, I'm here to tell you, they can, and they must, if we are going to get anything done. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will work with Democrats and Republicans. I will work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do. That is the job of a president, the duty to care for everyone. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision. It's a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That is the choice I will make as president. (APPLAUSE) BIDEN:\u00a0 But there is something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics, something darker, something more dangerous. And I'm not talking about ordinary differences of opinion. Competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I'm talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them. We must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to have our fists clenched, but our arms open. We have to seek not to tear each other apart, but seek to come together. You don't have to agree with me on everything or even on most things to see that -- we are experiencing today is neither good nor normal. I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes and remember what you saw, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches lighted, veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s. It was hate on the march, in the open, in America. Hate never goes away. It only hides. And when it's given oxygen, when it's given an opportunity to spread, when it's treated as normal and acceptable behavior, we have opened a door in this country that we must move quickly to close. As president, that is just what I will do. I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the entire nation. There is no place for hate in America. I will be given -- it will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been riled by instances of excessive police force, heart-wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protesters giving voice to the calls for justice, by examples of violence and looting and burning that cannot be tolerated. I believe in law and order. I have never supported defunding the police, but I also believe injustice is real. It's a product of a history that goes back 400 years, the moment when black, men, women, and children first were brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America. We can't have both. This is a nation strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of this looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America's streets. And we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacy groups menacing our communities. If you say we should trust America's law enforcement authorities to do the job, as I do, then let them do their job, without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. If you say we have no need to face racial injustice in the country, you haven't opened your eyes to the truth in America. There have been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter who I met with, who looked at me and said, in her small child's voice, \"Daddy changed the world.\" Also, Jacob Blake's mother was another, when she said, violence didn't reflect her son, and this nation needed healing. And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said: \"We're the ones getting killed. We're the ones getting shot. We have been hung. It's amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back.\" I think about that. I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that has for far too long never been recognized. What we need in America is leadership that seeks to de-escalate tensions, to open the lines of communications, to bring us together, to heal, to hope. As president, that is precisely what I will do. We have paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions of this country to impact on how we deal with the coronavirus, 210,000 Americans dead, and the number is climbing. It's estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year. Enough. No more. Let's just set partisanship aside. Let's end the politics and follow the science. Wearing a mask, wearing a mask is not a political statement. It's a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn't a political statement. It's a scientific recommendation. Testing, tracing, the development and ultimate approval and distribution of a vaccine isn't a political statement. It is a science-based decision. We can't undo what has been done. We can't go back. But we can do so much better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts politics aside and saves lives. We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and businesses to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. This pandemic is not a red state or a blue state issue. This virus doesn't care whether you live or where you live or what political party you belong to. It infects us all. It will take anyone's life. It's a virus. It is not a political weapon. There is another enduring division in America that we must end, the division in our economic life that gives opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where, in Abraham Lincoln, a child of the distant frontier, can rise to the highest office in the land. America has to be about possibilities, the possibility of prosperity, not just for the privileged few, but for the many, for all of us. Working people and their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that a country had to give people -- and I quote -- \"an open field and a fair chance.\" An open field and a fair chance. That is what we are going to do in the America we are going to build together. We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union, that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all. And, by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed against, just enough, just enough, against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again now. They must prevail again now. A hundred years after Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, the vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, also came here. And here is what he said. He said, our nation found its soul and honor in these fields of Gettysburg. We must not lose that soul and dishonor now on the fields of hate. Today, we're engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear, peace, not violence, generosity, not greed, and light, not darkness. I will be a president who appeals to the best of us, not the worst. I will be a president who pushes toward the future, not one who clings to the past. I'm ready to fight for you and for our nation every day, without exception, without reservation, and with a full and devoted heart. We cannot and will not allow extremists and white supremacists to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, to overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores, to overturn the America that has been a haven and a home for everyone, no matter their background. From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we are at our best when the promise of America is available to all. We cannot and we will not allow violence in the street to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to, at long last, face the reckoning on race and racial justice in this country. We cannot and will not continue to be stuck in the partisan politics that lets us -- this virus thrive, while the public health of this nation suffers. We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who have already got it made. Everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. BIDEN:\u00a0 Folks. (APPLAUSE) BIDEN:\u00a0 Thank you. (APPLAUSE) BIDEN:\u00a0 Duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good. And I will. It won't be easy. It won't be easy. Our divisions today are longstanding. Economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations. But I give you my word, I give you my word, if I'm elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together, because I think people are looking for that. We can disagree about how we move forward, but we must take the first steps. And it starts with how we treat one another, how we talk to one another, how we respect one another. In his second inaugural, Lincoln said, with malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us drive on to finish the work we're in to build up the nation's wounds -- bind up the nation's wounds. Now we have our work to reunite America, to bind up the nation's wounds, to move past shadow and suspicion. And so we, you and I, together, we press on even now. After hearing the second inaugural address, Frederick Douglass told President Lincoln: \"Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.\" We have to be dedicated to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg, that a new birth of freedom was at hand, I think it's at risk. Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question, whether it will allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain or be fulfilled. This is our moment to answer this essential American question for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this. It cannot be that, after all this country has been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years we have stood as a beacon of light to the world, it cannot be that, here and now, in 2020, we will allow the government of the people, by the people and for the people to perish on this earth. No, it cannot, and it must not. We have in our hands the ultimate power, the power to vote. It's the noblest instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. We will vote, no matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way, because, once America votes, America will be heard. Lincoln said, the nation is worth fighting for. So it was, and so it is. Together, as one nation under God, indivisible, let us join forces to fight the common foe of injustice and inequality, hate and fear. Let's conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other, who love our country, who will not destroy, but will build. We owe it to the dead who are buried here at Gettysburg. We owe that to the living and the future generations yet to be born. You and I are part of a covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and hope renewed. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions our time will give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. (APPLAUSE) BIDEN:\u00a0 Thank you. We can do this. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Joe Biden not taking any questions, speaking on the ground that Abraham Lincoln spoke on more than 160 years ago, echoing the same theme of a nation that needs to come together. Of course, in Lincoln's time, it would be two more years before that opportunity would president itself with the end of the Civil War, talking about a spirit of bipartisanship that must take control in this country, and that he wants to be a president who sees the best in us, and not the worst. Mark Meredith, who's been following the vice president, he chose not to take questions. He wanted this to stand alone, ahead of the vice presidential debate. But we learn all of this, as you know, Mark, with these negotiations on stimulus falling apart. The timing is rather unique, you know? MEREDITH:\u00a0 Absolutely, Neil. And I felt like this was a speech that really wasn't even geared to one particular party or a specific -- specific group of people here in Pennsylvania. Usually, when you have these campaign stops, you're trying to get a specific message across to a specific group. Instead, this was a speech that really did appear to try to appeal to as many people as possible, talking about unity, talking about hope over fear, peace over violence. And what's interesting here in Pennsylvania, a state that the polls, if they are to be believed, shows Joe Biden doing very well, is how many times you will see billboards across this state, Neil -- and I was driving through here yesterday -- that show:\u00a0 I am a Republican, I am a Christian, but I'm a Joe Biden supporter. That's the message that you're seeing on some of these billboards around town, while, at the same time, this is a state that President Trump won four years ago. And the Trump supporters were out here as the Biden motorcade was pulling into this speech. So, while the vice president may try to focus on unity, with less than a month to go until the election, both political parties realize this is all about trying to turn out their base, trying to get people out to the polls to pick a specific side, and look past just one specific issue. I thought it was very interesting that the former vice president talked a lot about some of the same things that we heard in his debate performance last week, but obviously was able to talk a little bit longer. He was able to talk without additional questions or without being interrupted. So it kind of felt like that. That was a chance for him to convey some of the similar messages he had a week ago, but this time doing it with the cameras focused solely on him. I should mention there was not a large crowd out there as the vice president was -- former vice president of speaking. Instead, it was a very small group, the press pool. But that was by design. The Biden campaign was not opening this up to massive ticket holders or anything like that. But I also thought, Neil, it was very interesting to see if this is what we're going to hear more of from Joe Biden going forward in these final days of the campaign. We know that they are -- they're trying to put every effort they can, just like both campaigns are, but maybe this is what we're going to see more from Joe Biden, already looking past what will happen on November -- in early November, looking ahead what the next year, what the next 10 years may look like -- Neil. CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes, that's right. So their debate is still on, on the 15th, as is the vice presidential debate that is due tomorrow. Thank you, Mark, very much. That's a very good wrap-up, my friend. I appreciate it. Want to go back to Capitol Hill right now, because the divisions are still there on the fallout from the president's decision to sort of cancel the talks -- not sort of -- he did -- has elicited a pretty varied response. Chad, what are you hearing? PERGRAM:\u00a0 Hey there, Neil. Well, here's a couple of nuggets here. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, indicates that he agrees with the decision by the president to suspend these talks. He says -- quote -- \"They were not going to produce any sort of result anytime soon. And there's going to be this focus trying to concentrate on confirming Amy Coney Barrett in the Senate the next couple of weeks here. Also, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she spoke with the secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, this afternoon about 3:30 just to confirm that the president had suspended the talks. And she expressed her disappointment and frustration with calling off those talks at this point. Here's the irony, Neil. You have so many members of Congress, both sides of the Capitol, both sides of -- both sides of the aisle, saying, we have to get a deal done, but they could not get together in the middle. There's something in science called the Fermi Paradox, the Fermi Paradox. And what that refers to is that, if the galaxy, the universe is so big, why can't we find life someplace else? Well, here we have another paradox. It's kind of like the Fermi Paradox, the idea that there are so many members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, who want to get something done, and they cannot find -- they cannot find that sweet spot to get a coronavirus bill done. The math simply just does not work at this stage. And the president put the kibosh on all of that today. That's significant. CAVUTO:\u00a0 And the Problem Solvers, they're bummed too, right? It is equal Republican and Democrats who thought they were close to something. Now they want the president to get back to the talks, but that's not going to happen, right? PERGRAM:\u00a0 Yes, there was just a statement from the Problem Solvers Caucus a few minutes ago. And they said: \"We cannot afford more delays.\" They thought that a deal was within hand. CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes. PERGRAM:\u00a0 They proposed a deal now somewhere around $2.1 to $2.2 trillion. And that kind of seemed to reignite these talks a couple of weeks ago here on Capitol Hill. CAVUTO:\u00a0 And that didn't happen. All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much. Again, we're still looking at the fallout from the president nixing these talks. There might be some wisdom on it that maybe is getting passed. A lot of these critics are saying, now's not the time to do that, or certainly myself, just wondering what the upside would be of that. But the bottom line is, the talks are not happening. The president says they will have to wait until after the election. We shall see.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" August 27, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: And a stirring rendition of the national anthem. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d from the White House tonight. The energy you can still feel it here. It was an incredible and an electric speech by the President. Some saying it was a little too long, but this was his moment and he connected with this audience here and across the country, if any doubt in your mind, about what's at stake and who can keep America, our country that we love safe and, on the road, to even greater prosperity. Well, Donald Trump just reminded you. Now, in moments we're going to be joined right here on set by the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. is making his way over here right now and South Dakota Governor and rising star, Kristi Noem. But first, the President knows that the Democrats are taking on political water after for months excusing these riotous events across the country. They called them protests for the longest period of time, but they went into massive looting that did enormous destruction from some of our most beautiful cities in the United States. And he took their pathetic and transparent shift attempt to blame shift to President Trump. He took that on tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York. Joe Biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals, spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they're starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I mean, you saw that today, right? So, Joe Biden and his Vice President Kamala Harris came out today and suddenly started condemning the violence. Well, where were they last week? They had an entire convention last week, they didn't mention the violence once, except to kind of very blandly refer to protests and the courageous protest. But the attempt to lay the destruction in those cities at the feet of Donald Trump, he wasn't going to stand for that at all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Look, if you think about it, Donald Trump's saying you're not going to be safe in Joe Biden's America, all the video being played is being played in Donald Trump's America. These guys are rooting for violence. That's what it's all about. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think the President the United States is rooting for the violence because he thinks it helps him politically? BIDEN: I think he views it as a political benefit. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: This is laughable. Mayors and Governors from Minnesota, to Wisconsin, to Oregon, to Washington, they've denied the President's attempts to bring calm to our streets. They rejected it all together. So, are these leaders that we want to turn the keys of the country over to? They're all supporting Biden and they're all voting for Biden. The ones who engage in this disgusting political calculation. So, they're putting partisan interests above the safety of our people? Well, Trump doesn't need political winds to push him in the right position. He's always been there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists and agitators and criminals, who threaten our citizens. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now, to drive that point, point home, the President asked an important question tonight. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: At the Democratic National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So, tonight, I ask you a simple question: How can the Democrat Party as the leader country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, the answer is they can't and they shouldn't. But the left is obsessed with power. And as the President said tonight, they'll try to get it back by any means necessary. And unlike President Trump, who puts the people's interests first, they put their political interests first, and this is why they want to try to take the reins of power from him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life. I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And America is a better country because those promises were fulfilled. With me now is Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at the Federalist, and Ari Fleischer, Former White House Press Secretary, both are Fox News Contributors. Mollie, I think it's safe to say that America got their contrast tonight. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's just stunning to compare the Democratic Convention last week with the one this week in substance and in style. Substantively, the Democrats were so pessimistic, so down on the country, not explaining a lot of their policy positions. Republicans seemed eager to talk about policy. Every, every night of the convention was a focus on policy achievements, you know, whether it's Criminal Justice Reform, Education Policy, and they seemed wanting to tell the country about why they do the things they do. And it was also a big indictment, I think of the media itself. Going through this convention and seeing the story being told that has been completely hidden by the media or lied about by the media about the accomplishments of the Trump administration, and I think that explains a bit about why so many people in the media are not having the best night they know that Republicans had a good convention and they know that Democrats didn't have a good convention. And because they have become more openly partisan. It's very frustrating to them. INGRAHAM: And Ari, watch some of the tweets being sent out during this address by members of the media who are right over there. They're angry that people weren't socially distanced and didn't have masks on, but it seems like the country is craving normalcy, and they like seeing people back together again, because we're social people we want to be together. But is that criticism going to land and cut through the optimism of tonight? ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It will for Democrats. For Democrats, I mean, this is what they, really, they look at a scene like this and they just can't identify with it. I just thought hearing applause was refreshing. I don't think you've heard applause at a live event in six months. But when -- I'm struck, when I look at the difference between the two. The Democrat Convention was all about Donald Trump is bad. The person, the man, he's bad. What Donald Trump laid out tonight was something much deeper. It was, what will happen if the Democrats win? It's societal. Its cultural. As the President put it, he talked about speech codes and cancel culture and crushing conformity. And then he talked about the violence in the cities. That's societal. That's the implications if this continues and if the Democrats stay in charge of the cities, and Joe Biden wins. That's a much more powerful message, I think, than just Donald Trump the man is bad. INGRAHAM: We're approaching the top of the hour. And - yes, we're approaching the top of the hour, and we are just getting started here on \"The Ingraham Angle\" and we'll be right back in just a few moments. INGRAHAM: Mollie, here is another way in which your - you see Trump drawing a clear distinction between the Republicans and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and the new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country. (APPLAUSE) Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. In this country we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in Almighty God. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Mollie, you heard the applause when the President - so very often referenced God and the Almighty Providence on the product-life question. That is really where he got the applause. How significant were the religious undertones tonight? HEMINGWAY: Well, not just tonight, but throughout the convention, again, there were these themes of redemption and opportunity. And it wasn't just about, having people give prayers to begin or end the evening, which is kind of standard at a convention. It was woven through every single - most everyone's speeches. Looking at these themes, people were being allowed to talk freely and openly about their faith. And it was in strong contrast to some of what we've seen in in in the culture. But the embrace of product-life values and having it not just be one speech, but again, many speeches. Also, reaching out really earnestly seeking Black voters to come join the Republican Party and doing it based on policy and not just platitudes, which is what you've seen in previous conventions, going through all the things that the Trump administration has done to try to gain Black voters and gain their trust and get them to - with Republican Party this time around. And they were real things, funding for historically Black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform, job growth, wage growth that really benefits Black men and women. And this is something unlike anything we've seen with the Republican Party and it was just less scared about talking about these things openly, whether it was faith or race or any of these issues that the Republicans have not particularly done a great job with previously. INGRAHAM: And Ari, I worked for President Reagan the last couple of years Reagan administration and the optimism of this week, and especially tonight, it really - I mean, I got a lump in my throat, because it took it took me back to - when I was in my early 20s. Just walking these grounds and giving tours on domestic policy shop. But it was it was Lee Greenwood, it was it was embracing that Reagan optimism. How significant could that be for those undecided voters that we're a great country, we're not an evil, dark, gloomy place. We're a place of great opportunity. Teach that to the kids. I got that tonight very strongly. FLEISHER: I think that's always part of an election. There's always a group that just wants to feel good about our country. And if things are really bad, then they're going to want to change and they want to get rid of the incumbent. But if they are hopeful, and that patriotism - and nobody does patriotism, like a Republican convention. You just got to love it. It makes the press whine a lot, but you got to love it even more. It is part and parcel of Republicanism and Republicans wear it on their sleeves. That's about the flag too. Laura, when you see people burn flags in this violence, it just tears you up inside. And then you hear this tonight you listen to the speeches, you see law enforcement. Yes, it's what conventions are supposed to be about. INGRAHAM: Ari and Mollie stay right there. We're going to get back to in a few moments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Joe Biden is not a savior of America's soul. He is the destroyer of America's jobs. And if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And told them he felt their pain. And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers. I ran for president because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And here with exclusive reaction to this final night of the RNC and the President's big speech is his son Donald Trump, Jr. Don, your father laid out a clear vision for this country, which is we're moving forward. We've gotten past a lot of the - most difficult parts of COVID with the tragedy that it is, and he laid out a vision of optimism and hope, which I just get the sense, people are craving in America. DONALD TRUMP JR. EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: I really did too, Laura. I mean, I felt proud to be an American watching this. And, honestly, watching the last four days of the RNC, when you compare and contrast that to what was last week, which was just like a never ending I hate America Zoom call. I mean, these stories that could only happen in America, the American Dream happening over and over to so many people have such diverse backgrounds, it's just been an amazing week and tonight top that off like nothing else. INGRAHAM: How about you personally? I mean, is it emotional moment for you? It's been a long in many ways. It was amazing for years for your family, but a very difficult time personally for your family as well through all the ups and downs and investigations. Personally, how are you feeling? TRUMP JR.: Listen, I feel great, because it's all worth it as an American, right? It wasn't easy at times, you know that. We've seen sort of what the worst of government can try to do. I mean, when you think about the beginning of this four years, it was the first time we had a not peaceful transition of power. I mean, that is one of the great American traditions, something that went on for 240 plus years, until now, until Donald Trump. And what's amazing about it, though, and what's really amazing about my father to me is that, despite all that adversity, I mean trying to throw his family in jail, unmasking his children, Russia hoax. I mean, they're still talking it about today as though it's real. Impeachment. He still delivered for the American people. He still put his head down, pushed through everything and got it done and delivered for the American people. That's an anomaly. That doesn't happen. That's once in a generation at best for an American politician to fight through that kind of adversity and still deliver, and still get it done, and that's what Donald Trump's all about. INGRAHAM: Today, Joe Biden, finally came out and condemned the violence, as did Kamala Harris. They both appeared after last week having not said anything, and they say this is Donald Trump's America in the cities we're seeing the worst violence and laying the blame at your father's feet. TRUMP JR.: Well, it's been going on for months and not one person - not one person, Laura mentioned, the violence, the rioting, the looting that's been going on around our country in Democrat cities, in Democrats states, led by Mayor Democrats, led by city councils that are all Democrat, not one person mentioned it in one week at the DNC. But now when CNN says, we know this is really kind of affecting the poll numbers now, it's getting a little ridiculous. Now, Joe Biden decides to step up. It's like the rest of Joe Biden's policies. Right. Now, after half a century in the swamp - after half a century, now he's going to deliver for the American people. Why would you wait 50 years? Why wouldn't you do it now? If Joe Biden could deliver for the American people? You think we'd have seen some of it by now? It's nonsense. It's smoke and mirrors. They do what the polling tells them. They do what CNN tells us and then they'll do whatever the radical Left tells us if they ever get office. But I don't think we're going to let that happen. INGRAHAM: Right now, I'm being told, that there are - I'm not going to call them protesters, because most of them are criminals threatening to burn once again St. John's Church down if they don't get what they want. They've gathered around the White House during the President's remarks, trying to drown him out, it didn't work. But it looks like we have another situation developing. It's being described as a riot in some circles tonight already. Your reaction to what that represents versus what we saw tonight? TRUMP JR.: Well, I think it's disgusting, right. When they're doing that - trying to burn down churches, burn down government buildings, rip down monuments to Lincoln and our founders, it's just mindboggling. Again, it shows the American people what we are truly up against when you have a mainstream media, that for weeks, were pretending that this was people protesting right. You saw it the other day on CNN. Well, it's fiery, but mostly peaceful protests, while there's buildings burning in the background and people being killed in the streets. This isn't Donald Trump. This has been Democrat policies were Democrat people have allowed this to happen. They've set by, they haven't condemned it. They've sat by and watched it happen in their streets as if there's tacit acceptance, because the Democrat Party is far more likely to stand with the criminals then they are with law abiding citizens who just want to live their American Dream. INGRAHAM: Let me just say Muriel Bowser, the Mayor of DC could have stopped a lot of this tonight. TRUMP JR.: Of course, they could. INGRAHAM: I mean, this was a-- TRUMP JR.: Of course, they would-- INGRAHAM: This was in the eyes of, I think, a lot of people here tonight. This was an attempt to really stifle and put a damper on this event tonight. You could - could you hear it up where you are? TRUMP JR.: Not really. You could hear a little bit, because they're going with air horns and stuff trying to disruptive. INGRAHAM: Yes, yes, yes. TRUMP JR.: But, that's the difference between the Left and the Right. They want to actually silence our freedom of speech. INGRAHAM: They don't want him to camp, Don. They do not want him to go to America. They don't - especially swing states, Blue state governors, where there's a mix of people, they don't want him to campaign. So what will your father do? Will he be stopped from reaching out and being with the people of this country in the next couple of months? TRUMP JR.: No, I think he's going to do that anyway. I mean, that's his happy place. Joe Biden's happy place is basement with a teleprompter. Donald Trump wants to be with the people. He wants to be with the crowds. He wants to speak directly to them, because, honestly, he's probably the first president in modern history that actually spoke to them during a campaign and then followed up and delivered for them. INGRAHAM: Will he go to Wisconsin, of course, the sight of another police involved shooting that supposedly triggered a lot of the violence in Wisconsin. Will he go there? TRUMP JR.: Yes, I imagine he'll be there, amongst other places. I know, the Vice President will be in Michigan tomorrow. I know our family will be all over the country traveling for the next 68 days, making sure that Americans get a chance to see our message. Obviously, they're doing whatever they can to prevent us from speaking directly to the people, for being directly with the people, because, again, the Democrats are the party of anarchy right now. We want our kids to be able to go to work, church and school, but they don't want that. They want anarchy, looting and rioting. INGRAHAM: Well, they can protest. But they can do this. They can do this. TRUMP JR.: They can do this. This is totally acceptable. INGRAHAM: Don, Hillary Clinton said, Biden should not accept defeat. If he loses, do not accept defeat. After they accused your father of someone who wouldn't accept defeat himself. Your answer to Hillary Clinton tonight? TRUMP JR.: Well, I imagine that's their plan. And Hillary Clinton hasn't just accepted defeat from 2016. She's been doing this nonsense. I mean, she's - it's mindboggling what she can continue to perpetrate on the American people. She has been running around pretending as though she won for the last few years. Then she talks about the popular vote. Well, if we were running for the popular vote, if that was how to play the game, we would have campaigned differently. That's not what it was. And she hasn't accepted that, like many politicians on the Left don't accept their elections. Because I believe Stacey Abrams, the Governor of Georgia in her mind only, also hasn't conceded that election, Laura. INGRAHAM: How will your dad bring calm to the country if he's reelected. How does this begin to subside? TRUMP JR.: Listen, I think calm just starts with peace of mind. We got to bring back jobs. We got to do the things for manufacturing that he started doing already, but they only he can do. Joe Biden's talking about bringing jobs to America after 50 years of shipping them abroad. Like why they change now, Joe? Why are we to believe? Is anyone stupid enough, frankly, to believe that this guy can do this now? This guy can't remember where he is 50 percent of the time, Laura. I mean, it's almost - it's said if it wasn't so scary. This is the future for our children. I want the guy that actually came in with no DC experience, who wasn't a part of the swamp. That saw something that was failed and decided to come in and fix it. That's what Donald Trump did for America. And that's why we need four more years of Donald Trump. INGRAHAM: Don Trump, thank you so much. Great to see you. TRUMP JR.: Thanks a lot, Laura. Great to be with you. INGRAHAM: Thanks for being here tonight. Now I want to bring back Ari Fleischer. Ari, the wife of slain former police captain David Dorn gave an absolutely searing and heart wrenching speech tonight (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANN DORN, WIDOW OF SLAIN POLICE OFFICER: how do we get to this point were so many young people are callous and indifferent towards human life? David is never, never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn't know and just didn't care. He would have done anything to help them. Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard Black lives. They only destroy them. President Trump understands this. Has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. We must heal before we can affect change. But we cannot heal amid devastation and chaos. President Trump knows we need more David's in our communities, not fewer. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Ari you juxtapose comments like that from Ann Dorn, obviously, heartbroken woman, with what we're seeing outside of the White House. And your heart has to break for America and those men and women out there in uniform who have to tolerate abuse night after night, from these types of criminals in the streets. FLEISHER: My heart broke watching Ann Dorn and I just teared up watching it. It was hard. She was so emotional, so personal, so vivid about what happened all because her husband tried to do the right thing and go out and protect a shop. And when you look at what's happening in DC now, you have to pray that none of that will happen in Washington. But what are they trying to accomplish in Washington? I don't know yet. Let's see what all these videos lead to. But if any of that happened in Wilmington? Did people descend upon Joe Biden in his speech in Wilmington, for whatever purpose to shout him down. And I saw also another video clip of people who left the White House to go to a hotel around the corner. Mobs have descended around those people and they're screaming and chanting and yelling in their faces. Why? This level of Mayhem is not good for our country, and is going to hurt the Democrats in November. INGRAHAM: Well, if you think America is an evil country - system chemically evil, then the only answer is to burn it down. I mean, that is where they want to take this Ari Fleischer. And I don't think it - I think you're right. I think in the end optimism kind of ends up winning out here. Ari, thank you so much. And my next guest became the liberal media's number one enemy for not locking down her state and stripping her citizens of their basic freedoms. And tonight Governor Kristi Noem was in attendance when President Trump gave his powerful acceptance speech and she joins me now on set. Governor Noem, we're seeing two different visions of America play out tonight. The one you just heard from President Trump - forward looking, optimistic, we can do anything together regardless of where you come from. And let's burn a church. SOUTH DAKOTA GOV. KRISTI NOEM: Yes. INGRAHAM: Your reaction. You're here in Washington. You're not in South Dakota, were it's a lot more peaceful. NOEM: No. Well, first of all, President Trump gave a fantastic speech. It was inspiring. It cast a clear vision for where he continued to want to take this country. And we're seeing outside the gates exactly the vision that Democrats have for this country. So I felt like we were in the middle of America here on grounds. People were happy. They were excited. They were looking forward to the future. And then you get right outside the gates and you see people who want to destroy everything that this country was founded on. Well, that's just astonishing to me. INGRAHAM: Well, why don't they turn on you, personally? Because you really received and are still receiving the brutal attacks from the Left. It's not just a debate. They're making it personal about your state and you endangering the lives of people, et cetera, et cetera. Why? NOEM: Because I didn't fall in line. And, it was amazing to me to watch people immediately fall into doing what they were told. And in South Dakota, we just took a very different path. I studied the science of the virus, made decisions that I thought were best for our people, told them I trusted them. And let them really exercise personal responsibility. And that is something that the Left does not stand for. They would prefer that you are sheep and follow and listen and let them control the agenda. Wherein South Dakota, people are enjoying their freedom today. We've been back to normal for over four months. And we're doing very, very well. And people are working, putting food on the table and enjoying life. They're pursuing happiness, which is something that I don't think we see anywhere in these Democrat led cities. INGRAHAM: But tonight you saw people visit the convention. Everyone's always happy at convention. But the country has been through an enormous amount. But they were happy people together. NOEM: Yes. INGRAHAM: And you had that at Mount Rushmore. NOEM: It was there. INGRAHAM: It was - it had some social distancing going on there. But it was - you had a lot of people. You had people on a motorcycle rally. NOEM: We did. INGRAHAM: Does the Left today despise, \"normalcy?\" That's why they want to usher in the new normal. Is that something they revile? NOEM: They're very interested in a new normal. And that's not what Americans want. They want to raise their kids like they were raised with neighbors in a community going to ballgames, going to church, deciding where they want to vacation, when's the last time anybody got to take a vacation? They haven't, because of what the Democratic agenda has been. And so that really is the clear choice that this election is about. And today's the perfect example of the choice that Americans should be making, and that's voting for President Trump. INGRAHAM: Joe Biden emerged today. He had a whole convention last week, but he emerged today to say this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They're looking for more violence and more disruption, because it helps them politically. He views this as a political benefit to him. He's rooting for more violence, not less, and that's clear about that. And what's he doing? He just kept pouring gasoline on the fire. This happens to be Donald Trump's America. (END VIDEO CLIP) NOEM: It's simply not true. I mean, none of that is true. What you've perpetuate violence in America lately has been led in Democrat cities that are led by Democrats, that have incited violence by the words that they use, and by the people that they get behind and support. We've seen Democrat leaders get behind these rioters, not bring forward consequences-- INGRAHAM: They're peaceful protesters, Governor. NOEM: --when they break our-- INGRAHAM: These are - what they're describing out there tonight, they're saying they're peaceful protesters. NOEM: They are breaking the law. And in America, we have a clear set of laws that the people have endorsed, that we follow. And there's fairness and equality under the laws that we enforce. And that is what is shocking to me is to see Democrat leaders completely ignore the law and risk people's lives - innocent people's lives. I thought the stories tonight were incredibly powerful. And when she told the story of her police chief husband, losing his life, that was a clear story of what we're seeing as consequences for what is being allowed in some of these cities. INGRAHAM: Governor, we got to go. But if Joe Biden, heaven forbid, should win in November, do you believe Mount Rushmore remains? NOEM: I'm going to always hope that Mount Rushmore will be there for generations. But I would be very concerned in a way that I'm not today. I know Mount Rushmore is secure today because President Trump is in this White House right here. INGRAHAM: Governor Noem, thanks for stopping by tonight. NOEM: Yes, pleasure. INGRAHAM: WE appreciate it. And stay there, we got more reactions to tonight's speeches. Plus, Kamala Harris tried to preempt Trump's keynote tonight by resorting to her favorite tactic, you guessed it, race baiting. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALICE JOHNSON, SENTENCE COMMUTED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP: I was once told that the only way I would ever be reunited with my family, would be as a corpse. But by the grace of God, and the compassion of President Donald John Trump, I stand before you tonight. And I assure you, I'm not a ghost. While in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer and ordained minister, and received a Special Olympics event coordinator of the Year Award for my work with disabled women. Because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body is trying to imprison my mind. Free in body thanks to President Trump, but free in mind, thanks to the almighty God. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh my God, I don't think there was a dry eye in this lawn when she said that. Back with me now Mollie Hemingway and Ari Fleischer. Also joined Joining us is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Victor. That was just another powerful message. And so many folks were - are texting me across the country saying they loved hearing from ordinary Americans telling their extraordinary stories about life, thanks to some of the efforts of Donald Trump. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Yes, I think the convention achieved two or three goals. It redefined the race is not necessarily Michelle Obama's great speech or Trump's tweets or liberal conservative, it's civilization versus civilization's discontents. In other words, the American way of life as we know it and is always constantly improving versus the people who are just so discontented, they want to tear it down. And then the Republicans wanted to dispel the idea that they were white supremacists are racist, but they really did much better. They redefined this division in America's class, which is an inclusive terms and you saw that at the convention. Black people, nonwhite people, White people, all the upper, and middle and lower middle class. And the Democrats fell into this trap of being Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street and very elite identity politics activists, and I think that really hurt them. And then finally, the winds of the news cycle had been changing from headwinds to Trump to tailwind sometime around mid-August. And then these conventions were going to adjudicate whether the Democrats could stop it, or whether the Republicans could accelerate that trend. It was very important, because at some magical point, I think it's one or two points away. Joe Biden strategies are inert, when Trump gets close on the polls. He'll have to go out, and you saw what happened today when he goes out, he makes a fool of himself. So I think that it was successful. And you can see that Democrats know that better than anybody, because they're relying on internal polling. Internal polls don't lie. You don't pay for somebody to lie to you in confidence. And when Michelle Obama says before and get out - to get out to vote. And Nancy Pelosi says, cancel the debates and Don Lemon say, address the violence. And Hillary Clinton says, don't concede, that's a reflection that the polls are changing. INGRAHAM: Yes. HANSON: And they're very worried, because Joe Biden will have to become a real rather than a virtual candidate. And that's not in their interest. INGRAHAM: Yes, the virtual stuff, Mollie, is not working. And Nancy Pelosi - for anyone who missed this today, this was kind of a culmination of what Ari and Mollie and VDH we've been talking about for a couple months about whether or not there'll be any debates at all. This is what Pelosi said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't think that there should be any debates. I do not think that the President of the United States has comported himself in a way that anybody should - and has any association with truth, evidence, data, and facts. I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Mollie, she doesn't think he's a legitimate president. HEMINGWAY: Significant that Nancy Pelosi after watching what was then three nights of the Republican convention, basically came out with a statement saying, Joe, we need you to stay in the basement, because that's better than even having you debate. I actually think Joe Biden will do fine in a debate. He's very good at shooting the breeze. And he'll do fine as he did fine in his last primary debate. But it really is significant that Democrats are so worried about it that they don't want him to go. The thing is, Joe Biden has three opportunity - had three opportunities, really, to change this race from one - well, to really make to make a significant statement. With who he picked as his vice president, with how he ran his convention, and then how he does in his debates. He flubbed the first one, the vice presidential pick. It was a totally wasted Democratic convention where they forgot to actually make the case for voting for them for any reason other than Donald Trump is someone that they personally loathe. And if he doesn't show up at the debates that is going to be devastating for him. But I think he will and he'll do just fine, I'm sure. INGRAHAM: Ari, we also heard remarks from the Muellers whose daughter was murdered and tortured by ISIS. Now listen to how they say that they were treated by Obama and Biden versus Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARL & MARSHA MUELLER, DAUGHTER MURDERED BY ISIS: The government led us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we've never heard from Joe Biden. The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than the American hostages in Syria. After 18 months of brutal torture, we learned from ISIS that Kayla had been killed. The Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is - let me just say this, Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been president when Kayla was captured, she would be here today. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Ari, I should say that MSNBC - least when I was watching them did not air that speech, a damning indictment of Obama and Biden. FLEISHER: And I hope a reporter follows up and ask Joe Biden, why didn't you call Carl and Marsha Mueller? Why? Why wouldn't you have reached out to them? But Laura, if I can, I want to go back to your question to Mollie about religion, and how you began this with a beautiful woman Alice Marie Johnson. And I should disclose, I have a client who works in criminal justice reform and I earlier this week moderated a discussion with Alice Marie, and I got to know Alice - even I got to know her better. But when people talk about religion and the power of faith, there are some people I know who don't like it, because they think it means oppression. I think it means telling somebody what to think and what to believe, shoving it down your throat. When you listened to Alice tonight, you heard the power of redemption. This is what faith does for individual who seeks redemption. What a powerful moving story. And that is the power of religion, that tens of millions, hundreds of millions in both parties share. It is a powerful part of America. And I loved hearing it tonight for that woman who is now free. INGRAHAM: I completely agree. It put a smile on everyone's face here. And it gives everybody hope that, just because something bad happens in your life or you do something wrong, there is redemption. That's the great Christian understanding. Victor, other things, of course, happened in the course of the last 24 hours, not only with Biden, and Harris coming forward, but with headlines that I know Victor you love with former McCain officials, former Bush officials signing another letter, not endorsing Trump, endorsing Biden. What does that tell you about where this Republican Party is today? HANSON: I think they're irrelevant. And they're terrified that if Trump should win, and I think he will, there's absolutely no place - there's not even a place as a distant anymore. They're nonexistent as if that they never existed in the first place. Mollie wrote a good column the other day and pointed out that a lot of these people are deeply invested in the swamp, in lucrative consulting and lobbyists. And then they pose as if they're brave renegades or something. They're not. They are people who are dissatisfied, because they don't have access to career enhancing positions in and out of government, in the revolving door and I know that's a cynical way to put it. But a lot of this angst is cultural snobbery, but especially a career disappointment. Because whatever Donald Trump is, he's not going to forget and he's not going to bring these people back in, I don't think. INGRAHAM: Yes, I think provides. HANSON: And they know it. And I don't-- INGRAHAM: Sorry. Yes. It provides a handy list of who should never work in a Republican administration again, if you ask me. HANSON: Yes. INGRAHAM: But Mollie, MSNBC, they were very upset tonight. And wasn't so much substantive, but it was involving masks. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: It's unnerving at a health level. I feel like we're watching chronicles of a death foretold here. JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: The actual humans standing in front of them or sitting in front of them applauding are in danger of dying from COVID now, and they don't care. It's bizarre. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: You can never have fun again in America, Mollie, if Donald Trump is president. No fun. HEMINGWAY: I don't think the media quite understand how much they discredited themselves by cheering on massive protests and riots where people were shoulder-to-shoulder marching through the streets for hours at a time or committing violence for hours at a time. They never had a word to say about coronavirus in the context of these riots. They have no standing to say anything now. But more than that, it really is this difference between Democrats and Republicans and how they presented their convention. Joe Biden with no need to wear a mask, put a mask like a heavy Black mask on at the end of his convention and went outside and socially distanced from his - from the person he's running with. Very big different optics from the Republicans who are saying, we're going forward INGRAHAM: Yes, it was extremely funny at face. Thanks so much Mollie and Ari. Victor stay there. Biden says they'll soon campaign in-person, but will he? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Well, maybe he realizes he can't really run for president from his basement, so Biden says he'll be hitting the campaign trail in the fall. COVID be damned. So can Joe even handle being out and about with people on the campaign trail? I mean, that honestly? He can't get basic lines of attack right. Take this unsuccessful attempt at recalling a line from Kellyanne Conway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: She said the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism, the more violence equals a better - better the choice for a very - excuse me, better for a very clear choice. These guys are rooting for violence. That's what it's all about. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But this is what you really said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: It was a quote today from a restaurant tour in Wisconsin saying, \"Are you protesters trying to get Donald Trump reelected?\" He knows full stop and I guess Mayor Pete knows full stop. That the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very your choice on who's best on public safety and law and order. (END VIDEO CLIP)' INGRAHAM: Back with me is Victor Davis Hanson and joining us Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor. Raymond, you've been following Biden throughout the campaign very closely. His vocal inflections, his tics, his gaffes. Is he actually going to be campaigning traditional? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, you said he was going to hit the trail. The only way Joe Biden at this point hits the trail is if he stumbles on something on the way out of the basement. But when I watched this today, he was grasping for words. He was reading a script through these two interviews with Andrea Mitchell and Anderson Cooper. And then that Kellyanne Conway quote, he bumbled it and bungled it two different times. Read it differently in both places. This is not a way to counter what we saw tonight fireworks and patriotism and heart and every life matters. And you had firemen and first responders here. This was an all American pageant and extravaganza wrapped up in the America First message. What Trump did tonight, I thought - someone said, \"Oh, the speech went on too long. Oh, he was - he wasn't himself.\" He was - No, I saw - and you and I watched him very closely. We were right up front. He was in command. He took the stage. And it was a gravitas tonight that we don't often see from Donald Trump when he's before a crowd, because he's more interested in entertaining-- INGRAHAM: Don-- (CROSSTALK) ARROYO: Yes, it's got a-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: We liked him. Well, we liked that. ARROYO: And I love that. And he had touches of it. But tonight was more statesman like. It was - he worked through the speech. The crowd was with him. And I think when you look at the fireworks, when you look at what preceded it, the focus on life, on faith, on our future and our history, all of that. I think people - Americans, when they go to vote, they look at a campaign and they look at a candidate like a mosaic. It's filled in bit by bit over time. This was a summation of that mosaic. And a great closing argument for Donald Trump going into this final stretch. INGRAHAM: Victor, how worried are they - the Democrats, about this idea of Joe Biden actually getting out of the basement? Are they worried? HANSON: Yes, they think he's a prisoner of his own paradox. They know he has to debate. But they know he can't debate. They know he has to have a press conference that's unscripted, but they know that if he does, it's disastrous. They know that when he comes out like he did today, that they'd be better off even with Kamala Harris taking over the reins and doing the heavy work, but if they do that, it's going to backfire on them. So he should have never been a candidate to be - candidate, because he was not all there and he knew that, and people had told him that. And once you do something you know is not feasible, and once you make a devil's bargain with Bernie Sanders, you've got these paradoxes. He knows he must condemn the violence. The polls tell him. He knows that if he does condemned violence, he's going to lose the Sanders, Antifa, BLM base, because he's made these compromises. So, whereas Donald Trump is free to say whatever you want. He's not conflicted. He's not beholden to anybody. Biden is a prisoner. He's almost a prisoner of these constituencies and his own self-created paradoxes. INGRAHAM: Now, Raymond, I love that. Prisoner of his own paradox. Only VDH will give us that. All right. Well, Raymond, I want to get back to Trump tonight, because I think this was Trump at his best. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country. (APPLAUSE) Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. In this country we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in Almighty God. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Thunderous response to the God. The God mentions which were many. ARROYO: Throughout this entire convention of from Sister Byrne to Abby Johnson, I mean to Bernice - Alice Bernice Johnson tonight. That was - somebody - I heard one of our friends, Donna Brazile mention it was like church watching the Democratic Convention. Listening to Alice Bernice Johnson tonight-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Alice Marie Johnson - Alice Marie. ARROYO: She felt like church to me with - complete with Hallelujahs. It was rousing. It was authentically American. And the Democrats tonight - and their cheerleaders we're seeing on the periphery of the White House painted the full picture for Donald Trump something nobody ever intended. They dramatized that light in the darkness. This these grounds were lit. In that darkness just beyond that fence, Laura, there were mobs of people hurting elderly, threatening to burn down the historic St. John's Church. They're painting and dramatizing the picture-- INGRAHAM: They don't understand. ARROYO: --in the streets of America. INGRAHAM: They're making it a very easy choice for people who might not like Trump's tweets or tone, but I don't like that. ARROYO: No, they're making Donald Trump's case for him and that's amazing. INGRAHAM: Yes. And Victor that's not - Victor, the difference here is that's not Donald Trump wanting violence. That's just the other side revealing that the systemic racism of America must be burned to the ground. That's what they're doing. That's not what he's doing. He wants to rescue these cities. HANSON: That's just a recognition of how it plays out in Middle America. It's very funny that the Trump convention were middle class people that were very upbeat. And yet they had none of the opportunities and wealth of the people that were showcased in the Democratic convention. So you had all of these elites that came on and talked about their particular identity or their victimization, or Michelle Obama being depressed, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and they're all unhappy. America, they've benefited more than anybody from America, and yet they're angry. And yet the middle class has always had it rough, they're upbeat and confident. And that was a difference. And they really pull that off. And it's revealed in the polls of minority voting that a lot of African-American support for Trump is going up to 30- 40 percent. That's because they feel more authentic and they're more genuine, and they don't come on and say you did this to me when they're very wealthy. They're very middle class like everybody else. INGRAHAM: Yes, that-- HANSON: And they said, we don't need any of your help, we're helping ourselves and that really appeals to people. INGRAHAM: Gentlemen, thank you so much. When we come back, my final thoughts on an amazing week. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. Joe Biden's agenda is \"Made in China.\" My agenda is \"Made in USA.\" (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, that about sums it up. What kind of country do we want to live in? What kind of country do you want to live in? You might not like his tone sometimes. But my goodness what we saw on the streets outside in DC, we've seen in Blue cities across the country over the last couple of months, that can't be what America embraces. This is an amazing country. This has been an incredible week and tomorrow night we'll have a lot more. That's all the time we have tonight. We'll be back again our normal time 10:00 pm.

Bernie Sanders is warning that President Trump is going \u201cdown the path of authoritarianism\u201d by refusing \u201cto commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election.\u201d The progressive senator from Vermont and runner up in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries \u2013 in a speech Thursday in the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 stressed that this year\u2019s presidential election \u201cis not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy \u2013 and democracy must win.\u201d TOP REPUBLICANS MCCONNELL, ROMNEY, PUSH BACK AT TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER COMMENTS The two-time Democratic presidential candidate and populist champion spoke the day after Trump \u2013 when asked at a White House briefing if he\u2019d commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the presidential election \u2013 said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to see what happens.\u201d The president \u2013\u00a0who for months has made unsubstantiated claims that a surge in voting by mail due to serious health concerns over in-person voting at polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic would lead to a \u201crigged election\u201d \u2013 stressed that \u201cI\u2019ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.\u00a0We want to get rid of the ballots and you\u2019ll have a very peaceful \u2013\u00a0there won\u2019t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\u201d Sanders, pushing back against the president\u2019s comments, emphasized \u201cthat\u2019s not his choice.\u00a0That\u2019s for the American people to determine.\u00a0Let us be very clear.\u00a0There is nothing in our Constitution or in our laws that give Donald Trump the privilege of deciding whether or not he will step aside if he loses.\u201d The president\u2019s controversial comments sparked immediate pushback not just from Democrats but also top Republicans in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 the most powerful Republican in Washington following the president \u2013 tweeted Thursday morning that \u201cThe winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.\u201d Sanders \u2013 in his first in-person speech since ending his presidential campaign in April \u2013\u00a0warned that the country faces a danger \u201cfrom a president who is a pathological liar, who has strong authoritarian tendencies, who neither understands nor respects our Constitution and who is prepared to undermine American democracy in order to stay in power.\u201d PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S TRYING TO HAVE CONSTITUTION 'SWALLOW CLOROX' And he charged that the peaceful transition of power, which he called \u201cthe bedrock of American democracy, is being threatened like never before.\u201d Sanders urged that with less than six weeks to go until Election Day, \u201cthat all Americans \u2013\u00a0Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives \u2013\u00a0come together to defend American democracy, our Constitution and the rule of law\u201d and ensure that the nation has \u201can election in which all votes are counted and an election in which the loser accepts the results.\u201d The senator pointed to controversial comments the president made last month at the Republican National Convention, when Trump charged that \u201cthe only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election.\u201d Sanders argued that what the president is saying \u201cis that if he wins the election, that's great. But if he loses, it\u2019s rigged, because the only way, the only way, he can lose is if it's rigged. And if it\u2019s rigged, then he is not leaving office.\u00a0Heads I win. Tails you lose. In other words, in Trump's mind, there is no conceivable way that he should leave office.\u201d Speaking directly to the president, Sanders said \u201clet me make this clear to Donald Trump: Too many people have fought and died to defend American democracy.\u00a0You are not going to destroy it.\u00a0The American people will not allow that to happen.\u201d Sanders claimed that the president \u2013 who narrowly trails Biden in the latest public opinion polls in many of the key battleground states where the presidential election will be won \u2013\u00a0\u201cis attempting massive voter suppression. He and his Republican colleagues are doing everything they can to make it harder and harder for people to vote. In addition, he is sowing the seeds of chaos, confusion and conspiracy theories by casting doubt on the integrity of this election and, if he loses, justifying why he should remain in office.\u201d \"Trump's strategy to delegitimize this election and to stay in office if he loses is not complicated,\" Sanders said.\u00a0\"Finding himself behind in many polls, he is attempting massive voter suppression.\" The senator called \u201con every elected official in America whether they be Republican, Democrat or Independent to vigorously oppose voter suppression and voter intimidation, to make sure that every vote is counted, and that no one is declared the winner until those votes are counted.\u201d And as a leading supporter of the former vice president, Sanders stressed that \u201ca landslide victory for Biden will make it virtually impossible for Trump to deny the results and is our best means for defending democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The National Museum for African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) has removed its controversial chart on whiteness from one of its webpages, telling people on Thursday that it didn't contribute to a \"productive conversation\" about racial issues. \"Since yesterday, certain content in the 'Talking About Race'\u00a0portal has been the subject of questions that we have taken seriously. We have listened to public sentiment and have removed a chart that does not contribute to the productive discussion we had intended,\" the museum said in a statement. Fox News reported yesterday that some described the chart as racist since it categorized things like \"decision-making\" and \"delayed gratification\" as part\u00a0of whiteness. The museum's graphic broke\u00a0the \"aspects and assumptions of whiteness\" into categories such as \"rugged individualism\" and \"history.\" For example, under \"future orientation,\" the graphic listed\u00a0\"delayed gratification\" and planning for the future as ideas spread\u00a0by white culture. DC MUSEUM CRITICIZED FOR SAYING 'DELAYED GRATIFICATION' AND 'DECISION-MAKING' ARE ASPECTS OF 'WHITENESS' Conservative author Ben Shapiro, who called out the chart, told the NMAAHC that its problems went beyond the chart. \"The problem ain't the chart.\" Shapiro said. \"The problem is the entire propagandistic critical race theory effort.\" The conservative commentator didn't specify what, exactly, is \"propagandistic\" in the portal -- which contains a wide range of information. For instance, that information includes potential microagressions that could be committed by White people. \"Acts of microaggressions include verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs or insults toward nonwhites. Whether intentional or not, these attitudes communicate hostile, derogatory, or harmful messages,\" the site reads. SEATTLE OFFERS CLASSES ON 'WHITE FRAGILITY' TO EXPLAIN ROOTS OF GUILT It also tells readers that \"if you are white in America, you have benefited from the color of your skin.\" The website also\u00a0maintained a video from \"White Fragility\" author, Robin DiAngelo -- whose book has been touted as a go-to in the wake of protests against racism ignited in part by the death of George Floyd. According to DiAngelo, white people have a hard time admitting their privilege. The portal reads: \"Dr. Robin DiAngelo coined the term\u00a0white fragility\u00a0to describe these feelings as 'a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves.'\u00a0Since white people 'live in a social environment that insulates them from race-based stress,'\u00a0whites are rarely challenged and have less of a tolerance to race-based stress.\" One of the embedded videos is a TedTalk\u00a0with the title: \"White Men: Time to Discover Your Cultural Blind Spots.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In describing the portal, the museum said: \"The site's intent and purpose are to foster and cultivate conversations that are respectful and constructive and provide increased understanding. As an educational institution, we value meaningful dialogue and believe that we are stronger when we can pause, listen, and reflect\u2014even when it challenges us to reconsider our approach. We hope that this portal will be an ever-evolving place that will continue to grow, develop, and ensure that we listen to one another in a spirit of civility and common cause.\" Located in Washington, D.C., the museum opened to the public in 2016. Congress established the museum in 2003 and, according to its website, is\u00a0\"the\u00a0only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture.\"",

            "article_content": " As I watch the continuing efforts to defund or abolish police across the country, I have been struck by the radical Left\u2019s willingness to stick with its dangerous ideology even when Americans are killed because of it. According to\u00a0Fox 32 Chicago, over Father\u2019s Day weekend, there were 104 people shot and 14 killed in the Windy City. Tragically, these statistics include a 3-year-old who was shot while in the backseat of his father\u2019s car. This follows the last week of May, in which 85 people were shot in Chicago, with 24 of them perishing. Fox 9\u00a0in Minneapolis reported there were a half a dozen shootings over the weekend that left 21 injured and two dead. These horrible casualties include a\u00a017-year-old who was shot\u00a0while driving. The people in the car with him when he was shot dropped him in the street and left him for dead. And, early on Sunday, there were\u00a012 people shot\u00a0while standing in line at a restaurant. One died. The weekend before, six people were wounded, and one was killed in other shootings. REP. FRED KELLER: DEMOCRATS WRONG TO OPPOSE REPUBLICAN POLICE REFORM BILL IN CONGRESS In New York City, there have been 51 shootings since June 15, with at least 24 victims in 18 incidents on Sunday alone, according to\u00a0ABC 7. The list of mayhem and death goes on. I can\u2019t help but wonder how many of these senseless murders could have been prevented if police in these cities had been supported by the politicians who command them. Instead of ordering police off the streets and threatening to cut their funding, the Democrats who run these cities should be working to reinstitute the rule of law and protect the innocent law-abiding Americans who they are supposed to represent. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Unfortunately, the radical Democratic Left is sticking to an ideology that stubbornly favors criminals and hates the law. As I wrote in my new book \"Trump and the American Future,\" which released on Tuesday: \u201cOne of the most dangerous trends of the radical Democratic Left is a pervasive desire (or ideological obligation) to vehemently protect people who break the law, contemptuously disregard the rights of law-abiding people, and actively hate those who work in law enforcement. When members of the radical Left talk about crime and punishment, they have a clear formula. \u201cToday\u2019s radical Democratic Left insists that those who break laws are to be automatically regarded as victims of systemic flaws or intentional acts of oppression within our criminal justice system. Law-abiding citizens who begrudge people who break the law are heartless, privileged people who are simply too ignorant or self-absorbed to understand the plight of criminals. And police are all vicious, hateful agents of tyranny who are only trying to enforce the flawed system of oppression.\u201d Keep in mind, I wrote this book\u00a0before\u00a0the horrendous killing of George Floyd and the start of the defund-abolish police movement. I wrote it\u00a0before\u00a0Democratic leaders in Seattle surrendered city hall, a police precinct\u00a0and six blocks of its commercial downtown to armed, violent anarchists. I wrote it\u00a0before\u00a0the Minneapolis City Council president said people who are worried about being robbed or raped are simply\u00a0expressing white privilege. If the radical Democrats continue on this path and allow this pattern of tragedy to grow, I suspect the American people will simply be sick of it by election day. If the radical Democrats continue on this path and allow this pattern of tragedy to grow, I suspect the American people will simply be sick of it by election day. According to a\u00a0YouGov\u00a0poll conducted last week, 53 percent of Americans oppose defunding police departments. Only 24 percent support defunding police. A full 73 percent oppose abolishing police \u2013 a radical Democratic clarion call which only 11 percent of the country supports. Some Democrats may begin to understand that this chaos is not sustainable, but I\u2019m concerned that there will be long-term consequences to treating law enforcement with such contempt. If we continue to treat police as the enemy, cut their budgets\u00a0and erode public trust in our institutions, I\u2019m afraid there simply won\u2019t be any courageous, self-sacrificing Americans left who are willing to do the job. If police are not here to serve and protect us, criminals will rise to exploit and endanger us. History has shown us time and time again, criminals will not stand up to the organized forces of society. But, if society refuses to stand up for itself, chaos and violence will reign. As a result, honest, law-abiding people will suffer. Liberty will be replaced by control, and justice for all will be replaced by vengeance for some.

            "article_content": "'The Five' evaluates Trump's chances of flipping Minnesota as both candidates hold dueling events This is a rush transcript from \u201cThe Five\" September 18, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, Emily Compagno. It's five o'clock in New York City. And this The Five.\nAll eyes on a key swing state today. President Trump and Joe Biden are holding dueling event in Minnesota after trading blows on a campaign trail last night. The president is hoping to turn the state red for the first time in decades and Joe Biden is trying to stop him. Here's the former vice president just a few minutes ago.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: In the midst of this unprecedented crisis, Trump has given up on pretending to do his job. As the president just started one week earlier in March than he did, we would have 36,000 more people sitting at the dinner table tonight. How many people across the Iron Range? How many empty chairs around those dinner tables? Because of his negligence and selfishness.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nPERINO: And President Trump is set to respond with a great American comeback rally tonight. It comes as the candidates step up the intensity of their attacks in key battleground states. Take a look at this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If Biden wins, very simple, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists and arsonists and flag burners, they win.\u00a0\nBIDEN: If the president had done his job, had done his from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. This president should step down.\u00a0\nTRUMP: Joe Biden devoted his entire career to offshoring Wisconsin jobs, outsourcing your factories, throwing open your borders.\u00a0\nBIDEN: I really do see this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue. The way we were raised up here in this area, an awful lot of hard-working people bust their neck. All they ask for is a shot, just a shot. All that Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nPERINO: Hey, Jesse, maybe I'll start with you. I think it's Fifth Avenue, not Park Avenue, just, you know, for fact checking here.\u00a0\nJESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. I think you were the only person to fact check Joe Biden, Dana. I mean, he got away with a lot of doozies last night. I don't know. I think Minnesota is in play. And Biden is getting spread very thin. He hasn't been to Minnesota in 1,000 days. And every day he has to go to a state like Minnesota which Democratic nominees never go to is a day he's not going to be in a state like Florida.\u00a0\nIt looks like Trump is doing five rallies in five battlegrounds in five days. And not only that, the whole family is involved. Trump Jr. is doing five battlegrounds in five. Ivanka is doing four battlegrounds in five.\u00a0\nEric is doing four. And Lara is doing a bus tour in Florida.\u00a0\nSi, they're really spreading Joe Biden pretty thin right now. He's come out of the basement. And he's on defense. And it's clear he wants to talk about the coronavirus. And right now, Minnesota, I think they are averaging about nine deaths per day. And that's not as big of an issue as it was this summer.\u00a0\nThe president has pivoted very aggressively to the economy and that's great. Because the economy is right now in a super v and they are predicting unemployment at 5 percent next summer. So that's the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history.\u00a0\nI know Juan wants to talk about the census report that just came out. Juan, you can't argue with these statistics. So just sit there and listen.\u00a0\nIn 2019, the average American household made an extra $4,400. It is an all- time high now, median income is $68,000. In just three years, the average American family has made nearly $9,000 more under Donald Trump. Under Barack Obama in eight years, they only got a $1,000 raise.\u00a0\nIncome inequality is now squeezing compared to Obama and Biden where it expanded. And the poverty rate is at an all-time low. Four million people have been lifted out of poverty under Donald Trump. A number like that we haven't seen in over 50 years. That's why the president is going to hammer the economic message and I think that's why he'll win.\u00a0\nPERINO: So, Juan, I'll give you a chance to respond to that. I did want to ask you one question though about Minnesota and Republicans. Is it, sort of fool's gold the way that Texas is for Democrats?\u00a0\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Minnesota, Dana?\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Because I think I just saw that Biden is up 10 in Minnesota. So, I don't think that's fool's gold.\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nPERINO: That's what I mean. Meaning that, let me clarify. No, I should clarify.\u00a0\nSo, Democrats keep saying they're going to win statewide races in Texas.\u00a0\nAnd they never do. Republicans are trying to win statewide in Minnesota and it has been elusive to them. President Trump has come closer than most. But this time around, do you think the Republicans are going to fall short again in Minnesota?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, I mean, you know, obviously there's an opportunity there given the trouble that happened in Minneapolis with George Floyd, and we've gone over some of the issues like, you know, the city council going back and forth on defund or reform the police, however you want to put that together.\u00a0\nSo I think that the president must think that, you know, that message about law and order and the like has some resonance there. But I don't know that it's working given what I just said about the polls.\u00a0\nBut I wanted to respond to Jesse as well and say Jesse, I think there are a lot of Americans who are going through real economic pain right now. A lot of that pain, that economic pain in terms of unemployment, specifically, is tied directly to the coronavirus, and we know from the president's own words that he wasn't straight with us when it came to how he handled the virus.\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWATTERS: Well, it's tied to the shutdown. It's not tied to the virus. It's tied to him shutting it down and then reopening up and then building it back the way it was --\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, but I'm saying --\nWATTERS: -- gang busters before.\nWILLIAMS: Well, I'm thinking that, you know, when I look at other countries, you know, our peers in the world, they've handled it better and their economies are coming back faster.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's actually false, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: And our economy won't come back --\n(CROSSTALK)\nWATTERS: Economic contraction to the United States are less than every single developed nation.\nWILLIAMS: OK. Look, I can see that our death rate, our infection rate is much higher than other developed countries, Jesse. And what I'm saying to you is, until we Americans get together and crush this coronavirus, we can't expect that our economy is going to have a resurgence.\u00a0\nAnd that means we can't be involved in politicizing masks, politicizing when a vaccine is coming. We can't be putting pressure on our CDC officials and telling them, yes, you're wrong about when the vaccine is coming.\u00a0\nPERINO: All right.\nWILLIAMS: That's got to stop. And I think Americans see that.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I agree. Let's not politicize it.\u00a0\nPERINO: The politics is here. Greg, I want you to listen to Joe Biden talking about the mask mandate. He still is talking about it.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBIDEN: I'd like to see the governors enforce mask wearing, period. I can do that on federal property. As president I will do that. We can have a fine for them not doing it. Look, this is about saving lives.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nPERINO: What do you make of him not landing on one consistent message?\u00a0\nGREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: That's joe, you know? He will say whatever somebody wants him to say. And if he realizes it wasn't the right thing, he'll just change it. But somebody did fact check him. John Carney. John Carney. I think over at Breitbart. I was getting confused with his brother Tim.\u00a0\nThat quote that Joe thinks is so clever. It's election. It's Scranton versus Park Avenue. And he's right except that Park Avenue supports Biden by a factor of eight to one margin.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes.\nGUTFELD: Right?\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\nGUTFELD: And Trump gets more money from Scranton than Park Avenue. So that's a good fact check. I have to credit John Carney. I, you know, this thing that he keeps saying, if we started a week earlier, you would have saved 30,000 lives. Why does he just say a week? Why doesn't he say two weeks? Why doesn't he say three weeks? Do those lives not matter? Or are we starting to get into the even deeper into the impeachment territory where we knew that we had completely missed this thing because the Democrats are obsessed with impeachment?\u00a0\nBut you know, it's funny. He says that Trump is responsible for all the deaths. And he said that data backs him up. And of course, that's not true.\u00a0\nBut Joe has to be super careful because he's going to run out of room for future demonization.\u00a0\nIf he keeps making it bigger and bigger and bigger, maybe Donald Trump next week will be responsible for not all past deaths but all future deaths.\u00a0\nMaybe he can take the killing, I don't know, Jesus or JFK or MLK.\u00a0\nI mean, the Dems, I keep thinking they've hit a limit on how evil they can portray Trump. I think they stopped comparing Trump to Hitler not because it was unfair to Trump, because they thought it was unfair to Hitler.\u00a0\nBecause they actually think that he is worse than Hitler.\u00a0\nThis has -- it's getting to a point where it is -- it's always been hilarious, watching that -- watching them create these evil fantasies. But I just want to wonder where they're going next, where, Dana? Where?\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\nGUTFELD: Tell me.\u00a0\nPERINO: Once you've already gone there, there's nowhere to go. Emily, that's going to be the last word.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\nGUTFELD: Worst thing Hitler --\nEMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Greg, there is definitely no limit. I'd like to address the clips that we played in the beginning of this segment. We know that Biden plays the union angle well. Right? That's why throughout the course of his career, he set up those events so frequently and really relied on them as his comfort zone.\u00a0\nBut while he's palling around with the union bosses, I think he should be more concerned with the union workers. As dana mentioned, we know that Trump carried more union workers in Minnesota in 2016 than any Republican since Reagan. But he's delivered on the promises that he made to them.\u00a0\nThis administration expedited mining contracts, which is critical in Minnesota. He renegotiated NAFTA. And many union members are upset and concerned about the direction that the Democratic Party is going with gun control and obviously energy.\u00a0\nQuick final point. Remember in July when Biden held that virtual event with Minnesota union bosses. A few days after he released his environmental plan. The union bosses cheered the plan. But a few days later, the workers were polled. And they said that what was most important to them was steady good-paying jobs. And what brings steady good paying jobs to them? They associate it with traditional energy and infrastructure jobs. The renewable energy is not the source of it. So that's where Biden should be concerned.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes, but there was an exchange on the Green New Deal last night too, which I'm sure we will talk about possibly coming up. Because CNN is taking some heat after critics blast that network for lobbying softball questions at Joe Biden last night.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nWATTERS: Basement Biden getting the softball town hall of a lifetime last night. CNN getting ripped for going easy on the former V.P., which stands in stark contrast to how President Trump was treated earlier this week during his own town hall with ABC. Take a look.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nANDERSON COOPER, ACNHOR, CNN: If you were president, could you see a scenario where you downplayed critical information so as not to cause panic?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you believe it's the president's responsibility to protect America, why would you downplay a pandemic?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How will you handle Russia's involvement with Trump?\u00a0\nHow will we know the many ways he has compromised the United States?\u00a0\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, CHIEF ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: But how do you stop police killing blacks at three times the rate of killing whites?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is your plan to build a bridge with voters from the opposing party?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nWATTERS: Wow. And when you look at the montage when they cut it like that, Dana, it's a pretty stark contrast as I said.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes. So, you know, if I were a presidential candidate -- I'm looking down here because I've got something, I want to read to you because I think it's going to make everyone laugh. I would rather be Trump than Biden in this scenario. Because the debate is 10 days away. You have to practice like you play.\u00a0\nAnd President Trump takes tough questions all the time. He bats them around. Sometimes he answers fantastically, other times it's like, my gosh, what is he saying? But he is used to really tough questions. Joe Biden is not.\u00a0\nAnd remember one of the things about Joe Biden is he does have a temper.\u00a0\nSo, if President Trump can provoke that temper, that will come off pretty badly.\u00a0\nI did want to point this out. The fact checker over at CNN said this last night about Joe Biden. Biden makes some false and misleading claims, but his assertions of fact have been largely factual. So, it just basically letting him off the hook completely.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Largely factual.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\nWATTERS: Greg, what did you think about last night?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Well, I didn't watch it. It was my sister's birthday so we went out to dinner, went downtown to a friend of mine's restaurant call Bistro Leo.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Nice.\nGUTFELD: I had -- I had two chicken dished and we had too lovely wine.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Nice.\nGUTFELD: So, I have -- basically playing catch up. And what I did do is I went to the CNN's web site. And you know how soft CNN was on Biden. When they can't deny it on their web site, Alice Stewart admits Joe got away with stuff at the town hall that he wouldn't have gotten away with at a debate. In the sense that no one held his feet to the fire because you need a pretty big fire to do that.\u00a0\nIt made me think about also, not just how they treated Trump but also -- I go back to that insidious town hall meeting on gun violence where they propped up that idiot sheriff.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes.\nGUTFELD: Remember they made the idiot sheriff seem like a hero and they just went after and basically did a witch trial on Dana Loesch. It's like they don't hide their biases very well unlike me.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes, you're the best at hiding your bias. The coward from Broward I remember that town hall.\nGUTFELD: Yes.\nWATTERS: All right. Emily, take a look at some footage here. You know, they made this big announcement at the top that they were going to be socially distant, and six feet. But when they thought they were going to a commercial break, they got up a little up close and personal, Anderson and Joe.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCOOPER: When we come back, we'll have more questions from our audience from former Vice President Joe Biden. Thanks.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Of course.\nWATTERS: I mean, do we care about that or is that something that, you know, everybody does?\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Well, everybody probably does it. But I think what this indicates is the fact that Joe probably forgot that he had to socially distance.\u00a0\nWe keep talking about this being a softball town hall. It was wiffle ball, you guys, with literally friends and family.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes.\nCOMPAGNO: And all of his comments were just accepted. And I actually want to focus on one that I found the most galling for maybe a different reason than most. It was the Ivy League comment that he made about President Trump. We know it was false, of course. Many presidents have had, have been presidents without having that Ivy League degree.\u00a0\nBut the point to me is that it was an elitist privileged comment and it represents to me that Joe Biden that is in reality what everyone continues to ignore of his party. And it is exactly what the progressives, which are his handlers, are seeking to dismantle with their movement, which is the old white privileged male who furthers the notion that to succeed in this country or have value in this country, you have to have participated in and subscribed to this elitist structure that already exists. I found it pretty telling and like everything else, it went unchecked.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes. Juan, one of the things I noticed with Joe and it's not just in this town hall, he has trouble answering these questions a lot. He's weakest part is when he talks about climate and energy. Fracking and the Green New Deal. He seems very unsure of himself. And he's constantly changing his positions with regards to those issues because of his crazy left-wing base. Do you see that as a problem going forward for him? Because he's having difficulty there.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I am interested. I'll listen, Jesse. But I haven't seen that. I don't see it. I mean, what I saw -- first of all, obviously Trump didn't have to do the ABC town hall with undecided voters asking questions. He chose to do it. He walked in there. I think he's a big boy. He knows what's going on.\u00a0\nThe big difference in these town halls to me was not the questions because obviously at the ABC hall and also with Joe Biden, many of the questions came from the audience. It wasn't the journalists that you guys like to say are so biased. And I think the big difference here is empathy. It's the two men.\u00a0\nJoe Biden clearly has empathy and Donald Trump clearly doesn't have empathy. A lot of voters vote on feelings even before they get to climate change and policy. And what they saw was a demonstration of someone who, you know, when he's asked about, you know, pre-existing conditions, doesn't have an answer, someone starts talking to him about someone dying of cancer, he goes off on COVID.\u00a0\nYou know, Joe Biden gets interrupted by a Republican, a Republican who says Joe, I'm not finished. And Biden says I'm sorry. Go right ahead and finishes. Look, I mean, I think that's a big show about who they are as human beings. And I think that was the message and it was not a good message for President Trump.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: But I've got to say, when -- it's this kind of criticisms that are untethered -- it's great to say, you know, this person doesn't have any empathy. Well, maybe he should provide actual facts to back that up. The guy is sending tons and tons of money to people who are suffering. He's made an incredible economy before COVID. You could go -- he's ushering in these peace deals.\u00a0\nBut you have this incredible evidence that he lacks empathy. But you never tell us what are the actions that are coming from that lack of empathy, when his actions are exactly the opposite of that. We shouldn't -- well, none of us --\n(CROSSTALK)\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think that what happened --\nGUTFELD: No, no. If this is the kind of achievements that you're getting from having no empathy, we should all not have empathy.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Juan, do you want to give an example really quick?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think that what we -- yes, I think what happened in -- you know, we learned with the Woodward book that he wasn't straight with the American people and put our health, our families at risk. That is lack of empathy.\nGUTFELD: That's not -- no, it's not.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Juan?\nGUTFELD: That's a misdiagnosis on your part.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. Some people would say empathy is Donald Trump's greatest quality.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: He would say that.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Some people being Donald Trump. Up next, it only took three months. Nancy Pelosi finally is getting around to condemning violence. Why she's doing it now though? We'll tell you.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCOMPAGNO: Welcome back. What took her so long? Nancy Pelosi is finally condemning the looting and riots after almost four months. Here's the House Speaker.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We support peaceful demonstrations. We participate in them. They are part of the essence of our democracy. That does not include looting, starting fires or rioting. Those are -- they should be prosecuted. That is lawlessness.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCOMPAGNO: And some in the media continue to laugh off the increase in violence.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDON LEMON, HOST, CNN: You listen to conservative media, you would think that, you know, entire cities are just, you know, brawled in fights and fire and whatever. We went out to a great dinner in New York City tonight.\u00a0\nPeople actually walk up to us and said thank you for, I watch you every night. I can't believe. They thought they did a double take at us actually hanging out. Not seeing us on the TV screen. But New York City was not, you know, a hell scape, was it?\u00a0\nCHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN: I mean, the one guy who run with a machete who tried to guess. No, of course it isn't.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCOMPAGNO: Greg, the laughing over violence is revolting in my opinion.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Well, I think it's hilarious.\nCOMPAGNO: Will anyone on the left care?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I think it's hilarious.\nCOMPAGNO: You do?\nGUTFELD: I tell you, man, I love it when the media admits to their impeccable research. Even though there was a 50 percent spike in murders in New York City August -- from August 2020 to August 29. Don Lemon went out to dinner and he wasn't killed.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\nGUTFELD: He wasn't murdered. So therefore, the whole crime wave it just never happened. This is -- this is the state of journalism. That if it doesn't get close to you, if it doesn't affect your life, it didn't happen.\u00a0\nHe never -- he never went downtown during the looting. So apparently that didn't happen either, right?\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Yes.\nGUTFELD: And some -- I'm going to stop. But it just goes back to the point that they judge their suffering by how it affects them, which is why Nancy is now involved because it's going to affect her politically.\nCOMPAGNO: Juan, in some cities, including ones right by me here on the west coast, the looting and rioting is continuing. It's still going. Why did it take this long for Speaker Pelosi to condemn it?\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think I can't think of one Democrat who condones rioting, looting, and fires. I mean, obviously, Joe Biden's condemned it and I think that Nancy Pelosi, you know, I think she should have done it sooner. If that's the point, Emily, I would have been braced it, but I mean, she's done it.\nAnd no matter how slow she has been, she's faster than Donald Trump has been in condemning what the FBI director said just yesterday is the number one source of a threat to the homeland, which is white supremacist violence. He's never condemned that young man who killed two people in Kenosha. He never condemn --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: That's not true. He did it. It's in the transcript. He condemned white supremacy. You can look it up. I'll send it. I'll e-mail it to you, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: OK, fine. I appreciate it.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Jesse.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But he's never condemned that guy who killed a security guard out in Oakland. So I mean, you know, this is -- to me, it's like a double standard.\nCOMPAGNO: Jesse, I'll let you respond to that and in how that might help the president during this election season.\nWATTERS: Well, if he was asked to condemn whatever happened in Oakland, I'm sure he'd condemn it, Juan. But I mean, Cuomo was on CNN saying, where in the Constitution does it say that protests have to be peaceful? Jerry Nadler said, Oh, Antifa, that's a myth.\u00a0\nYou know -- you had -- you had governors and mayors refusing to call in the National Guard and just letting their cities burn it. Come on, Juan. I mean, you know -- you saw what happened all sorry. It's crazy. So -- but it's funny because you can see --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Cities burn down across America.\nGUTFELD: They kind of did.\nWATTERS: I mean, you've seen the footage, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, they didn't. You tell me, what city burned down? Come on, guys.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Minneapolis, Kenosha.\nGUTFELD: Minneapolis. $2 billion in insurance damage.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Burned down? Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Minneapolis burned down. I see.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I guess those businesses ruined are funny to you too, Juan. Big joke.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, you said -- you said -- you guys make it out like cities burned down. This is like totally exaggeration.\u00a0\nWATTERS: OK, where are the $2 billion in insurance cost come from? Where did they come from? You think that's insurance fraud?\nWILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Jesse, I was interrupted. I didn't hear you.\nCOMPAGNO: If your livelihood was on that one block or those nine blocks, it would have gone. Sorry. We need to get Dana in here. Dana, what are your thoughts?\nPERINO: Look, I think that Nancy Pelosi probably is looking at some polling and realizing that it is hurting Democrats. However, the lawn order message is not helping President Trump in some of the battleground states as much as his economic message which is why I think you're seeing the pivot.\nCOMPAGNO: OK, ahead college campuses going to extremes to stop the spread of COVID. How they are cracking down next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nWILLIAMS: A major COVID crackdown on some of America's top college campuses. Several colleges going to extremes to stop the spread of the Coronavirus after outbreaks all over the country. New York University reportedly suspended an online-only student who lives off-campus, but they suspended him indefinitely for attending a rooftop party. The student was caught on video and the video was reported to school administrators. In order to return to class, he has to write our reflection paper. Meanwhile, Ohio State joining other colleges in officially canceling spring break because of COVID-19.\u00a0\nGreg, I think if I was that young man's dad, I'd be pretty upset. I wouldn't like it. But on the other hand, I come to you because I want to hear your thoughts, and why you is a private school, there are no rules about this, there's no guidance, so why shouldn't they set their own rules to protect students and professors?\nGUTFELD: I guess -- I guess you're right. They can do it if it's a private school. But I am very, very -- I'm heartbroken over no spring break.\u00a0\nThere's going to be so many casualties. For example, think of the -- think of the industries that are going to suffer with no spring break, OK. The companies that sell crash diets. I mean, millions try to fit into that bikini like two weeks before spring break. Then there's the -- then there's the jello shot industry. This is essentially their Christmas season.\u00a0\nAnd what about the creepy dudes that do sleazy beachside competitions, the wet t-shirt contest. They're going to be very lonely. And then what about the badly translated tattoos that you only get on spring break. And of course, without spring break -- without spring break, no college romances ever break up, right? Because you come back -- you come back and there's a picture or a text and then it's over. And that's going to -- you're going to be stuck with the same person for four years.\nWILLIAMS: Oh my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Jesse, what about the absence of national guidelines for these colleges?\nWATTERS: I mean, like you said, it's a private deal. And as someone who's written a few reflection papers, man, those -- I mean, that is still punishment, Juan. I got to tell you, that the last thing this kid wants to do. And you know, this is not an illegal act. He did not commit a crime.\u00a0\nAnd if you take this out even further, you can say, if someone is having unsafe sex off-campus, then they can be suspended because there is a chance they could catch a disease and spread the disease all over campus endangering the health of the entire quad. You can't do that.\u00a0\nSo, I don't think this guy's going to write a reflection paper. I think he's going to write a letter, and his lawyer is going to sign it, and he's going to get out of this. Trust me.\nWILLIAMS: Oh, OK. Dana, I wanted to shift a little bit to Nashville.\u00a0\nApparently, some of the city officials there, withheld data about low infection rates. And people are upset because they say hey, you're not being transparent.\nPERINO: Well, I don't know a ton about this story, though. I know that there's a lot of interest in it. Of course, I have lots of friends in Nashville that we're sending this around and local officials there will have to answer any questions that there are about these things. I don't think there should be national guidelines. I think decisions are best made at the local level whenever possible.\u00a0\nAnd in some cases, you haven't -- universities, these huge spikes, I know that's happening in Utah, but then you also have this really confusing messages. The University of Georgia, for example, announced that they would be having football, and they would be having fans in the stance, but they would not be able to host in-person voting.\u00a0\nThen, that got turned around because people said that doesn't make any sense. But I think that a national mandate for any of these decisions is not a good one. Local decisions are best, even if they're this really tough and really complex.\nWILLIAMS: Yes, I agree. Emily, Attorney General Barr, one of your fellow lawyers, he said that these restrictions on having people locked down and moving all that, he says -- incredibly to me, he says, you know, this is an intrusion -- invasion of your civil rights. It's akin to the worst invasion, then almost equal to slavery. Isn't that a bit much?\nCOMPAGNO: Well, I think the point that he's trying to make is one that is really valuable here, which is that if our constitutional rights are being infringed, then the law doing it needs to be narrowly tailored to further that legitimate goal. That application should be happening all over the country.\u00a0\nAnd I want to make a quick point about that poor NYU student. He was, in fact, following New York City Public Law, and NYU didn't have a more restrictive policy at that point. So literally, he was following the rules, and he still got publicly shamed. And the saddest part about it is that he will probably lose his scholarship because he was suspended even if he's accepted back even if the reflection paper works. And he can't afford that tuition, and he already has a job offer, and that job offer is contingent upon him getting the diploma that he likely can no longer afford.\u00a0\nSo what we're watching play out is real-world consequences for these hair on fire, knee jerk decisions being made by these people in positions of power over others just to make their point.\nWILLIAMS: Well, let's hope Jesse's lawyer comes through for him, Emily.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I'll make a call.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY\" up next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nGUTFELD: Yes. \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY,\" we're answering your question. All right, from Frenchi -- I haven't heard from her in a while. Who is your most interesting friend, Jesse?\nWATTERS: I think I'm the most interesting friend of my friends. But besides me --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\nWATTERS: Nothing.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You should have said your wife.\u00a0\nWATTERS: My wife. She's so interesting and I'm so interested in her.\nGUTFELD: There you go. Oh, you are disgusting. Emily?\nCOMPAGNO: I have a million interesting friends. I will choose one, however, right now. She was born on an island to a Navy father and sort of a weekend mother. And so, she had this like half hippie, half military existence.\u00a0\nShe's incredibly intelligent, off the charts brilliant, majored in philosophy and dance, and has had this amazing career doing all these different things. And now she is an EMT firefighter here in Washington State.\u00a0\nShe's incredible and she shines a light wherever she goes. And everything that comes out of her mouth is really interesting and refreshing and unique and, and she's beautiful inside and out.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It sounds like a real bore. Hey, what does it have to do with -- what does it have to do with Twilight? That sounds literally like Twilight.\u00a0\nJuan?\nCOMPAGNO: And her name is Bella.\nGUTFELD: Juan, who's your most interesting friend? It's OK to say me.\nWILLIAMS: That's OK? OK, then Greg. Greg is my most interesting, compelling\n-- you know, an intellectual friend. Yes, I would say so. Yes.\nGUTFELD: Do you have an authentic one?\nWILLIAMS: Oh, wait a minute. You can't -- you're doubting my compassion and my empathy.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right.\nWILLIAMS: I would say, you know, I know -- you know what I think is interesting is I know a lot of people in politics, Greg, and boy, I tell you they go up and down and all around. I don't know. Sometimes I think, are we really friends? But yes, we hang out, I guess. I don't know. It's difficult.\nGUTFELD: That's true. Dana, how about you? Don't say Jasper.\nPERINO: A lot goes through my head.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You can't say a dog.\u00a0\nPERINO: I have to say Peter. Oh, yes, Jasper is definitely up there. You know, I'm going to say, President George Bush.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Oh, name drop.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That's a great one.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes. Wow.\u00a0\nPERINO: Comfortably smug too.\nGUTFELD: I have so many interesting friends. I'm going to take one that's not interesting. Brian Kilmeade. All right, good question. I saw --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: What happened to Lou?\nGUTFELD: You see, Lou is interesting -- Lou is the most interesting man in the world. And apparently, he sold a lot of T-shirts yesterday. He owes me a cut. Oh, who's your favorite T.V. mom? Who's your favorite T.V. mom, Dana?\nPERINO: Oh gosh. Oh, Marge Simpson.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Oh, that's a good one. That's a great one.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I like her.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes. Juan, would you agree or pick a different one?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I'm old so I like Samantha. Remember, Bewitched.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Oh, yes, yes.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I like her a lot.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Elizabeth Montgomery. I wonder what Tabitha is up to.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Good memory.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes, she was not -- she was easy on the eyes, Emily. Your favorite T.V. mom?\nCOMPAGNO: OK, I'm like losing my mind, freaking out, and I know that I'll have like a ton come to my head later. But in this moment, I'm thinking of Downton Abbey which was totally my -- except -- or maybe that character in Revenge, the mom, because she was the ultimate villain. Do you guys know who I'm talking about?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: No.\nCOMPAGNO: Guys?\nPERINO: No.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Really?\nCOMPAGNO: Thank you. The executive producer does and that's all that matters. Yes, she's amazing. I'll go with her. She's totally amazing.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right, Jessie.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Was Aunt Becky a mom?\nGUTFELD: Aunt Becky?\nWATTERS: Full House.\u00a0\nPERINO: I think she was an aunt.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: She became -- yes, she became one at the end. She goes to jail, is that the one?\nWATTERS: Yes, I think she's in jail right now. Yes, she was good. I liked her.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, gosh.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: There's an idea, Prison Moms. Maybe that's a bad idea. My favorite T.V. mom -- Marge Simpson's the best, but I'm going to go with the mom that I grew up with, Mrs. Cleaver from Leave it to Beaver.\u00a0\nPERINO: That's a good one.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: That was a good one, Barbara Billingsley, who -- wasn't she an airplane? Wasn't she the one that smoke jive on the plane?\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Yes, yes.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Wow. Oh, we got a tease now. Yes, yes, it's just came to me. Yes.\u00a0\nAnd Hugh Beaumont. I love you Hugh Beaumont. \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nPERINO: Hey there. Before we get to \"ONE MORE THING,\" we got a big surprise in store for you this Monday. Now, we'd love to tell you what it is but it's a secret, so you'll just have to join us on Monday to find out. I can't wait.\u00a0\nAll right, it's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" I'll go first. Let's look at North Dakota for a moment. There is a community there that just did the most amazing thing for a man named Lane Unhjem. He had a heart attack when he was tending his crops and he had to go to the hospital and there was his combine caught fire. You could see that there.\nSo nearly 60 farmers but their own harvesting on hold to come out and cut over 1,000 acres of farmland for the Unhjems, 11 combine, six grain carts, and 15 semis were used for the seven-hour harvest. Neighbor said letting the crops go unharvested would have been a major setback for the family, and that helping out was just common sense.\u00a0\nLane was hospitalized, but he's in stable condition and no doubt, feeling good about his community and neighbors. So, we love to see that.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: I love that. It's awesome.\u00a0\nPERINO: All right, Greg, what do you have?\nGUTFELD: All right,\" THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" tomorrow 10:00 p.m. I got -- what's her name? And I got Joel Pollak, Kat Timpf, and Tyrus. Hopefully, Emily will say \"literally\" maybe every segment, and talk about Twilight.\u00a0\nAnd now, let's do this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nGUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nGUTFELD: Literally. Yes, Literally great. Literally great. Day six of my NFL boycott. I'm watching different sports like this ball game with my friends. Check out these cats. They're joining me. Look how interested they are in this game. Very interesting --\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Cute.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: They are -- they're adorable except that mustache looks a little fascist on the right. But I could just be, you know, just a -- just a chance. I can't control that little spot above the upper lip.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Cute.\nGUTFELD: Yes, it is.\u00a0\nPERINO: That is excellent.\nGUTFELD: Thank you.\u00a0\nPERINO: Very good \"ONE MORE THING.\" All right, Jesse.\nWATTERS: All right, Greg, I will see your cats and I will raise you some dogs. There we go. Does Jasper ever do this? He's just drinking some raindrops. He's thirsty.\nGUTFELD: Drinking raindrop.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's what happens when you don't put water out for him.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Poor puppy.\u00a0\nWATTERS: You know, beautiful. And speaking of drinking, \"WATTERS' WORLD\"\u00a0\n8:00. Do you ever have a show where you feel drunk, but you're not? This was one of those shows. It felt good, you felt loose, you felt drunk? You didn't have anything to drink, but it felt like it. This was a show like that.\nGUTFELD: So, wait, it's not live?\nWATTERS: Greg, I hate you.\nPERINO: OK, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: OK, so wildfires have been burning through the West in the last month, as you all know, leaving thousands homeless, 30 dead. But the heroism of the people fighting the fires caught the attention of a five- year-old Carver who lives in North Western Oregon. Yes, that's baby Yoda, the plush doll. And little Carver sent the doll and a thank you note to the firefighters.\u00a0\nHe said, many of them are far from home and need a friend. Now, pictures of the baby Yoda being held by firefighters, have their own Facebook page, and it's attracted thousands of followers. Way to keep hope alive, Carver. So cool.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Nice.\nPERINO: That is awesome. That's great. Emily?\nCOMPAGNO: I'm a Ford girl, but Ram is doing something pretty awesome. They have a built to serve series. And today, in honor of the United States Air Force's 73rd birthday, they are releasing a built to serve 1,500 pickup trucks. The best thing about this whole series, you guys, is that they're built at an auto plant by U.S. military veterans.Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good Sunday morning, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Maria Bartiromo. Straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": some good news for American workers on this Labor Day weekend. According to Friday's jobs report, the unemployment rate dropped to 8.4 percent in August, with the U.S. economy adding nearly 1.4 million new jobs, this as lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for more coronavirus relief talks, after failing to reach an agreement last month. One of the leading GOP voices in the negotiations, Senator John Barrasso, is here with his expectations for a deal and if Americans can expect a second stimulus check. Also ahead, Maria's brand-new interview with Trey Gowdy. As we await the results of John Durham's criminal probe, are James Comey and John Brennan already doing damage control? All this against the backdrop of the 2020 election, now just 57 days away. Also coming up, Maria's exclusive conversation with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on President Trump's second-term agenda and why he believes the president's tough-on-China policies could win him a second term. We will also hear from Gordon Chang on the China challenge and why he is taking the Pentagon's new report on Beijing's military very seriously. All that and more as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But first: the White House and Congress temporarily averting a government shutdown on Friday, agreeing to extend federal funding at its current level. Vice President Mike Pence said he hopes that this will allow lawmakers to focus on next the coronavirus relief package when they return to work next week. Joining me right now, Republican Conference Chairman Senator John Barrasso. Senator, thank you very much for joining us. It didn't get a lot of fanfare, but we can imagine what would have happened if there was a government shutdown. So, that was a pretty big hurdle. Just how much momentum can we expect out of that and to this very elusive agreement? SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, it's an important thing to do. We need to do just that. But I will tell you, Charles, we need to keep the government funded, functioning. But I will tell you, I will believe it when I see it. It's not beyond Nancy Pelosi to play politics with this. We have been at this point before, where Democrats just want to add more money to the federal debt, with more spending. We need to end government shutdowns permanently. I have introduced legislation with a number of my colleagues, the End Government Shutdown Act, so that there would never be a government shutdown again. PAYNE: Yes. BARRASSO: It is the commonsense thing to do. PAYNE: I know there's been dozens of these short-term agreements, right? So it would be welcome. But, in the meantime, it would be even more welcomed if Americans had that security of at least one more fiscal package. That bridge that was created by federal funding, the swift actions of the White House really resulted in some amazing things with our economy, things that economists said could not be done four or five months ago. We saw more of that on Friday with the jobs report, unemployment rate, 8.4 percent. Really, just three months ago, Senator, I was hearing 20 percent for the rest of the year, honestly. And no one looked at this number, 1.37 million jobs. And if you dig into the numbers, because there are two surveys, 360,000 jobs for black Americans, 170,000 for Asian Americans, one million new jobs for Hispanic Americans. We have got this momentum. But I think some in Congress, particularly on the Republican side, may be taking it for granted, not realizing it was their swift action that helped us, and now is the time to add more fiscal stimulus. BARRASSO: Well, these are blockbuster numbers, Charles. It is part of the great American comeback. I think it's terrific, 10 million new jobs. As you said, the experts were all wrong. They said we would still be at 16 percent unemployment. But I think this is a function of the leadership of the president, of President Trump, and what the Republicans have been focused on doing, but also the integrity and hard work of the American people, who want to get back to work. We still have a ways to go. PAYNE: Right. BARRASSO: And a vaccine will make a big difference for that. We have a targeted package that the Republicans want to put forward to help people get back to work. There's paycheck protection money in there for our small businesses to continue. I expect Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to block that. You know, it's almost as if the Democrats think they will do better in the election if more people are suffering. Charles, you heard Joe Biden say he would shut down the economy again. Charles, that's the absolute -- that's a mindless thing to do. PAYNE: Yes. BARRASSO: That's not what we need to do as a path forward for America. PAYNE: Yes. Yes. BARRASSO: He is so wrong on this. We need to continue all full speed ahead, the vaccine and reopening the economy fully. PAYNE: And to underscore your point, President Trump doing what he can, as Congress, more or less -- I hate to say it, but it feels like they're sort of fiddling around right now. The executive order, with that $300 payment from the federal government, 45 states have taken him up on that. They're going to kick in an extra $100. But that's temporary. The government, the administration found that money in a pool out of FEMA. So, there is a sense of urgency. Listen, it wasn't necessarily a political story, per se, but Nancy Pelosi's blowout, the visit to the hair salon without the mask, and the subsequent woman losing her business over all of this, can that create a sense of urgency? If someone like a Nancy Pelosi, with a reported fortune of $114 million, can go to the salon, get a blowout, not wear her mask, while Americans are living day to day, moment to moment of praying for additional help, can that get us closer to this finish line? BARRASSO: You know, it really should, Charles. But this is Nancy Pelosi, one rule for her and one rule for the rest of America. I'm just not surprised by this. I'm not surprised that she has attacked the single mother of two who owned the salon, who is likely to go bankrupt, as a result of the fact that we don't have additional paycheck protection money. So, to me, this is Nancy Pelosi as Cruella De Vil, saying no to paycheck protection for workers and small businesses all around the country, but at the same time telling one small business that they should open, but only open for her. This is a sign of contempt for American workers. PAYNE: Right. There feels to be also a certain kind of irony that the Democrats are insisting on a lot of money for states. Many of these states had already been extraordinarily irresponsible. They have run up unfulfilled pensions. They have got these programs to welcome people into their states and their cities that are poorly funded. And now they're -- most of them are -- or many of them are actually still shut down. They have exacerbated the problem. The number of small businesses in California that have needed to tap into the payroll protection plan, for instance, is enormous. And yet you have places like New York, where they're on the verge of putting out almost every restaurant owner in New York City. California still won't open completely up. You have got a lot of places that are equivocating on school reopenings. And the irony to me, Senator, is that they already were asking for a lot of money for these states, and now they're going to need even more. Does that create an impasse? How do you get around that? Because we do know that these states and these cities need money to bring kids back to school safely. But how do we make sure, as American taxpayers, it's not used for other things that they were reckless about? BARRASSO: Well, you're absolutely right, Charles. And that's why Republicans have a targeted piece of legislation to get people back to work, get kids back to school, and get the vaccine out to people all across America. And that's what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi continue to block, because they have this trip to Fantasy Island, a $3 trillion bill, a trillion of which, Charles, one-third, has nothing to do with coronavirus. It's all of the things that you have listed. It includes environmental justice and direct paychecks to illegal immigrants. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. PAYNE: Right. BARRASSO: Look, Republicans are never going to be able to win, nor should we try to win a bidding war with Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. We're going to continue to focus on the things we need to do to get children back to school safely and get more businesses open all across the country. That's part of the great American comeback. PAYNE: Senator, you mentioned the vaccine a couple times. And in an interview, Kamala Harris seemed not to be sure of whether or not she would take one if it was approved on November 1. And, of course, such a decision has already been downplayed or shot down. Everyone understands that the key, the ultimate key, to us getting back to 100 percent where we were is a vaccine. What do you make of the politicization of a vaccine that would be approved before the election, even though it's gone through all of the rigors, that normal vaccine process? It was just sped up because the administration put a lot of money toward it, but, still, it checks all the boxes that you would check for any drug approval. BARRASSO: Well, let me say this about Kamala Harris' comments. This is somebody who has campaigned to take health insurance away from 160 million Americans who get it through work. This is someone who has campaigned to have taxpayers fund health insurance for illegal immigrants. But this statement about the vaccine is her most irresponsible statement of all. I'm a doctor. I'm very encouraged by where we are with the vaccine. This is moving forward at warp speed. We're in stage three trials. Multiple vaccines look like they're going to work. We're working on plans to get these to the states, so that our health care workers can get them, the most vulnerable can get them, people with preexisting conditions. The vaccine is the path forward for all of America. And yet what we see is -- and it's not just Kamala Harris -- 77-year-old Joe Biden said he wasn't sure if the vaccine was safe or real. When it comes to this vaccine, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are absolutely wrong. Charles, I have written a piece on FOXNews.com about just how important it is for all of us to get the vaccine and to make sure that the scientists continue to work at this rapid pace. PAYNE: Someone -- I heard this saying in the last few months: Trust the science. Trust the scientists. I'm not sure who said it. But it seems like a lot of folks who it's trickled off of their lips are now saying, well, we may not trust the scientists if it means that we -- it could hurt us in the election. I mean, again, that would put a lot of American lives at risk, in my opinion, if they were to really shoot this down. BARRASSO: I agree with you, Charles. When you talk about the upcoming election, to me, this is the most consequential election in our lifetime. And you take a look at what the differences are vs. the issue of jobs and the great American comeback we have under President Trump, vs. Joe Biden, who said he would shut down the economy again. With regard to taxes, Joe Biden is ready to go with $4 trillion of additional taxes. And then just take a look at law enforcement and where we are there, the Democrats who want to defund the police. Republicans want to defend the police. So, all across the board, Charles, when it comes to our of freedoms of speech, of religion, of Second Amendment rights to own and bear arms, the fundamental difference is so stark. PAYNE: Right. BARRASSO: And that's why I support President Trump and will vote for him for reelection for president in 2020. PAYNE: Senator John Barrasso, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. And I really appreciate it on this Labor Day weekend. Thank you very much, sir. BARRASSO: Great to be with you, Charles. PAYNE: Straight ahead: Maria's exclusive interview with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Joe Biden's China problem and why he believes President Trump is the better candidate to take on the Chinese Communist Party. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome back My thanks to Charles Payne, who will be back in a moment with more breaking news later this hour. But first: the China challenge, as the CCP-run Global Times re-ups its endorsement to Joe Biden, proclaiming that his presidency would be -- quote -- \"good news for Beijing,\" as he -- quote -- \"represents U.S. liberal pro- established elites\" and is more reasonable than President Trump, according to The Global Times. But what would this mean for everybody else here at home in the United States? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was among the first to warn viewers of this -- on this program about Biden's Beijing problem. He joins me right now. And, Peter, it's always great to see you. Thank you so much for being here. PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: Hey, Maria. Great to be with you. BARTIROMO: So let's talk about this state-run media. You have got The Global Times saying that they think Joe Biden will be a better pick to run America than Donald Trump. And then you have got this most recent threat coming from the South China Morning News, which basically taunts the United States with its handling of Huawei. This most recent tweet from the head of The Global Times says that, if the U.S. keeps poking Huawei, then maybe the Chinese officials will not export the medicines that are so vital to America. We know that more than 70 or 80 percent of our active ingredients in prescription drugs are made in China. Your reaction? NAVARRO: Economic security is national security. That's one of the principles of the Trump administration. And what we have learned from this China virus pandemic, Maria, is that we have to bring our medicines home, our medical supplies, and our medical equipment. And the Chinese Communist Party is just putting an exclamation point to that when they threaten us. And if we bring those jobs back onshore, as we have been doing, we will create great jobs at great wages, but also protect the American people from the Chinese Communist Party. So, that's a very provocative action they're taking. We're no stranger to seeing that. But I think it was interesting that, in the same week, both dances with scarves Nancy Pelosi in the Rotunda said that Joe Biden was the preferred candidate of the Chinese Communist Party, and then The Global Times comes out, effectively, with their endorsement. What would that mean for the American people? We know what it would mean, devastation in the Midwest, our blue-collar workers just getting hammered. We lost over 70,000 factories, Maria, over five million manufacturing jobs. BARTIROMO: Wow. NAVARRO: And it was because Joe Biden likes made in China. Donald Trump came along in many ways because he said, hey, that's not good. That's not right. I'm going to fix that. And so what President Trump has been carefully doing is putting in place a wide range of policies, whether it's lowering the corporate income tax to bring investment onshore, steel and aluminum tariffs, or buy American. And, most recently, speaking of those medicines China wants to bully us with, the president signed an executive order that will essentially enforce buy American rules and promote advanced manufacturing of pharmaceuticals right here in the good old of U.S. of A. So, Beijing Biden vs. made in America Donald J. Trump, I think that's one of the stark differences between the two sides. And it's really interesting, Maria. If you watched back when with the Democratic Convention, or you watch CNN or MSNBC, which are effectively propaganda organs for the Democratic Party, you never hear them talk about where the virus came from. BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: They won't say the word China virus. If you try to say it, they cancel you. And the reason is, the whole Biden Democratic Party strategy is, it's a dangerous one for them and for us, because it's predicated on being able to blame Donald J. Trump for the pandemic. And my view is, the only president in the world who is responsible for killing over 180,000 Americans, putting 40 million Americans out of work and costing us trillions of dollars is the unelected president of the Chinese Communist Party in China, Xi Jinping. BARTIROMO: Peter, I want to ask you about capital markets. NAVARRO: Sure. BARTIROMO: Some people say that capital markets are funding a lot of this activity in China to begin with. And then I want to get your take on the president's second-term agenda. So, let's take a short break, and then we have got a lot more with Peter Navarro in just a moment. We're looking ahead this morning on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: And we are back with Peter Navarro, coming to us from the White House. Peter, let's talk about China and the U.S. capital markets. There was another Chinese IPO that went public just about a week ago. This is China's answer to Tesla. It's an electric vehicle maker trading in the United States. There's a lot of movement here to stop Chinese companies from getting away with not reporting their true accounting. You know Senator Kennedy's bill. I want to talk to you about whether or not the United States is, in fact, funding China with its open-door policy for capital markets, even if many of those companies may be working with the Chinese military to create weaponry that, who knows, at some point could be used against the American military. NAVARRO: Well, the answer, Maria, sadly, is yes, with a big exclamation point to it. And this president, President Trump, has been taking very strong action in terms of sanctioning Chinese companies that are involved in things like the concentration camps in Xinjiang province, or abuses in Hong Kong, or Huawei trying to steal, effectively, our information and infiltrate our networks. So, financial sanctions, visa sanctions have been very effective so far. But you point out what is the other problem here, which is the continued flow of capital from the United States, particularly our pension funds, into companies that support the Chinese military efforts, that support the human rights abuses. And then that -- and also who defraud investors, because they do not abide by accounting standards. One of the things that really troubled me over the last couple of years was this guy named Ben Meng. They -- he's a Chinese citizen here. BARTIROMO: Capitalist. (CROSSTALK) NAVARRO: Citizen here, but he was part of the Thousand Talents program, which is a conduit for spies for China. And he served for two years in the Chinese government in the division which is effectively in charge of currency manipulation. And the next thing we know, he's in charge of CalPERS, which is, like, one of the biggest pension funds in the world. It's California employees pension fund. And, as soon as he got in there, he started jettisoning all the American stocks and other stocks and loading up on these speculative Chinese companies. And it turns out he actually had to resign from there. But that's the kind of thing where, right now, because of the way our stock market indices are organized and required, they're literally forced to buy the stocks of Chinese companies that effectively are part of the Chinese military industrial spying, human rights abuses, concentration complex. So, that needs to be dealt with. And we're -- this president is the toughest president ever on China. And that issue is certainly one that people are looking at. BARTIROMO: What will be the president's priorities if he is reelected, Peter? NAVARRO: First of all, it's bringing home the domestic manufacturing of our personal protective equipment, medical supplies and medical equipments, and, as we're doing that, fill up the Strategic National Stockpile in a way which makes it not just bigger, but smarter. So that's like step one. The second step has to do with testing. We have done a miracle job in terms of rapidly increasing our testing capacity. But the more important thing, Maria, is what we have just begun to do, which is deploy these small pregnancy test-type point-of-care tests, which are cheap, economic, and we get them out to people with a quick, quick result. BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: So, that's going to be part of it. The fourth is therapeutics, things like remdesivir, convalescent plasma. BARTIROMO: Sure. NAVARRO: And, finally, this whole thing with the vaccine horse race development, we're -- we should have a vaccine in mass production for half- a-billion doses by the end of the year. BARTIROMO: Wow. NAVARRO: So, that -- beat the China virus, that's essential. BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: On the jobs front, we know that the president was the best jobs president in the history up to the point where the Chinese walked in here on January 15, without telling us about that virus. BARTIROMO: That's right. NAVARRO: We know that that China virus hammered this economy. But we know which person, Biden or the president... BARTIROMO: Yes. NAVARRO: ... can get us back through the policies like deregulation, tax cuts, getting that energy sector going and all of that. BARTIROMO: Right. NAVARRO: So, that's important. The last... BARTIROMO: Yes. I was really... NAVARRO: Go ahead. BARTIROMO: I enjoyed the president... NAVARRO: I got more. BARTIROMO: The lineup of things that the president talked about in terms of a second-term agenda, including some of those economic policies that really lit a fire under this economy back in 2016 and back in 2017. Peter, it's great to have you this weekend. Thank you so much, sir. NAVARRO: You take care of yourself, Maria. BARTIROMO: Peter Navarro joining us. Coming up, Trey Gowdy is with me with his expectations for John Durham's criminal investigation, including who he thinks will be indicted, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Do you know if the bureau ever relied on the Steele dossier as part -- as part of any court filings, applications, petitions, pleadings? JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I have no awareness. GOWDY: Did the CIA rely on it? BRENNAN: No. GOWDY: Why not? BRENNAN: Because we didn't. It wasn't part of the corpus of intelligence information that we had. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: That was Trey Gowdy grilling former CIA Director John Brennan as chairman of the House Oversight Committee back in May of 2017. Gowdy was one of only two GOP congressmen, along with John Ratcliffe, who saw all of the redacted documents in both the Trump-Russia investigation, as well as the Hillary Clinton investigation, that e-mail probe which the FBI was conducting simultaneously. Trey Gowdy joins me right now. He's a FOX News contributor, and the author of the new book \"Doesn't Hurt to Ask: Using the Power of Questions to Communicate, Connect, and Persuade.\" And good morning, sir. You have done that so well over your career. We appreciate you joining us this weekend. Good to see you, Trey. GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. You too. Thank you. BARTIROMO: So, where are we? We're waiting -- we are waiting on the results of this criminal probe from John Durham. He -- we watched you interview John Brennan back in 2017, where he said he didn't use the dossier at all. What's your take on the arrangement of the CIA, the FBI, and who is culpable here for using this piece of information, which we know was just hearsay made up in a bar, as evidence or as reason to get a warrant to wiretap Carter Page and the Trump campaign? GOWDY: Well, we certainly know the FBI is culpable. And you don't have to take my word for it. Michael Horowitz is not a rock-ribbed Republican. He was nominated by Barack Obama and unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate. So, he's hardly a partisan. He dinged the FBI. The FISA court dinged the FBI. The Senate Intelligence Committee dinged the FBI. I mean, everyone who's looked at the FBI's conduct in the fall of 2016 says, they didn't even meet the most basic of expectations. I like to pivot to the fall of 2015, or earlier, in 2016, who was driving the engine, who was driving the train then? I'm hoping Durham can tell us how this whole narrative -- I get that Russia was trying to attack us. I get that. The narrative that somehow the Trump campaign was complicit or conspiring with them, where did that start? What is the evidentiary basis of it? And I think Durham -- I'm not going to prejudge what he's going to find. I think it will be a mixture of the CIA and the FBI. BARTIROMO: OK, because you make really an important point for our audience to understand, because, up until now, the FBI keeps telling us, and they told you to your face, we started an investigation into Trump in July of 2016. But, Trey, we know there's all this activity early in 2016. And, certainly, from what I have been able to glean from it and report, it certainly feels like they were sending informants at Trump campaign people to try to entrap them, so that, in 2016, they could come up with these reasons for arresting them. GOWDY: I invite your viewers, view this thing in three parts. What happened before the summer of 2016 with Papadopoulos? Where did it start? Then the counterintelligence investigation signed off on by Peter Strzok in July of 2016. And then you got to view separately the fall of 2016 with Carter Page. They're all hopelessly interlocked, but you need accountability at every one of those three stages. And you have got to view them in three stages. Or, at least, that -- I think that's what's most productive. BARTIROMO: So, it's interesting, because, when you look at whether you're a target or a witness, John Brennan seems to be doing some P.R. around his interview with John Durham. He's telling people: Well, I'm not a target. I'm a witness. I mean, there is concern that John Durham is dragging his feet. So, how come we haven't heard from Durham? And walk us through being a target vs. a witness and what John Brennan is saying now, because he just interviewed with John Durham. GOWDY: Yes. I mean, those are words that the bureau and the department throw around. My experience, as a prosecutor, is your status can change in an instant. You can move from being a witness to a subject to a target. So, I understand that Brennan's P.R. machine wants us all to believe that he's not a target. That status can change. You're one document or one false statement away from going from one to the other. So, with respect to Durham, my expectation is that he is going to access documents that Devin and Ratcliffe and I never got to see. He's going to access documents that the FBI never shared with Congress. And he will write the definitive accounting of what happened. Whether or not there will be more indictments or not, Maria, I don't know. And I like to assume that there will not be. And I know that that puts me in a small minority, but I'm assuming the that Clinesmith indictment will be the only one. But I would liken it to Secretary Clinton. She was not indicted. But when the jury in November of 2016 met, they did mete out punishment, they did mete out accountability. So, regardless of whether Brennan or Comey or Strzok or Page or Baker or anyone else suffers a criminal consequence, the jury has a chance in November of 2020 to weigh in and say, you know what, you didn't meet our expectations for law enforcement. We're going to mete out the punishment, whether or not there's an indictment or not. BARTIROMO: Yes. But you can imagine some viewers looking at this system and saying, there are two different systems of justice. I mean, you oversaw the investigation into the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal. And, I mean, look, when you look back at that, there were 30-plus-thousand e-mails which were destroyed. I mean, I call that obstruction. There was a meeting two days before Hillary Clinton was to get an interview with the FBI, a meeting on the tarmac in Phoenix with Hillary Clinton's husband and a sitting attorney general. Loretta lynch met with him on a private plane. They actually left -- found out about -- people found out about that meeting, and they said, oh, we were talking about the grandkids. I mean, come on. So, I ask you this. Is there any way at all that, for example, the Chinese Communist Party, knowing their espionage, knowing what they have done, is there any way they did not know that a sitting secretary of state and a sitting president, Barack Obama, were communicating on an unsecured server? And were they breaching? And were they looking at those e-mails in China? GOWDY: Well, you raise a lot of good points. Let's go back to Jim Comey's infamous July 5 press conference. And let's go back and look at the drafts of his speech, and the fact that he had included the likelihood, the probability that a hostile foreign country had accessed her server. And then he decides to edit that out. So, you point out the discrepancies between the way President Trump was treated and the way Secretary Clinton. You barely scratched the surface in the discrepancies. BARTIROMO: Right. GOWDY: I mean, think about sending the questions ahead of time. The Department of Justice let her know ahead of time. (CROSSTALK) GOWDY: They decided ahead of time she wasn't going to be charged. The defensive briefings. Look at how they briefed her vs. how they briefed or did not brief President Trump. And the one that just staggers me, Maria... BARTIROMO: That's right. GOWDY: ... is the allowing of fact witnesses to sit in on her interview. She had a small law firm... BARTIROMO: Right. GOWDY: ... a small law firm sitting with her, and yet they can't be bothered to let General Flynn have a lawyer present. So, yes, there's a lot of discrepancy. The thing I would just caution your viewers, I know your expectations are high. I know you're disappointed. We, as a culture, you got to have a criminal statute. You got to have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. BARTIROMO: Yes. GOWDY: But narrowly avoiding indictment cannot be the only way we mete out punishment in our culture. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, sir. GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. BARTIROMO: Trey Gowdy joining us there. Charles Payne will be back with a lot more news after this short break, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) JOHN RATCLIFFE, U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: In this position, I'm privileged to see more intelligence than anyone else in the country, other than the president. That includes all members of Congress. And I -- as I see intelligence every single day, when you consider the fact that the amount of intelligence that we get, and we consider economically, militarily, technologically, China is the greatest threat that we face. I don't mean to minimize Russia. They are a serious national security threat. But day in, day out, the threats that we face from China are significantly greater. And I think that's clear. And anyone that sees intelligence knows that, and anyone who says otherwise is just politicizing intelligence for their own narrative. (END AUDIO CLIP) PAYNE: That was Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe speaking exclusively with Maria Bartiromo last week, in his first interview since being sworn into the office on May 26. Our next guest has also warned viewers of this program about Beijing's global ambitions. Gordon Chang is a senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute and also the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\" Good morning, Gordon. Yes, obviously, you have been up front and center on this, a lot more than anyone. And now it seems like everyone is catching up to your warnings. And the irony of this, of course, is, you have got to wonder if it's too little, too late. A report out from the U.S. military this week that China now has a larger navy than the United States. China has more air defense missile systems. They have more land-based missiles. Essentially, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that America was asleep. This is more than just an embarrassment, isn't it? This is a serious threat. GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, this is a serious threat, Charles. You referred to the Pentagon China military report, which is an annual report. And, in it, it was alarming this year, because they were more realistic. And, by the way, China has whole classes of missiles the United States does not have. And the reason is that we were in the INF Treaty, which prohibited intermediate-range missiles. China was not a member of the treaty. And so, therefore, it developed missiles that can hit U.S. Navy ships. So, clearly, we have a long way to go to even get to parity with China in some classes of weapons. PAYNE: Now, to my knowledge, right, President Trump, though, took us out of that arrangement. And I remember when talks that he was going to do that came up, the media went nuts. They were like, it's another agreement with the world, and we're lacking leadership. It's nuts because we sat there and watched China become a military power on par and in some cases beyond what we even can provide right now. CHANG: You're absolutely right, Charles. You know, we should not have been in the INF Treaty, when China was not a party to it. This is not the early days of the Cold War, the 1980s, when INF made some sense. And you're right. The media did go nuts about this, because they said, oh, President Trump is withdrawing from the world. What he was doing was, he is permitting the U.S. Navy to develop the same class of missiles that China had. So, we have got to understand, multilateralism is great when all the countries in the world are part of it and when they want to be. China right now is going on its own. And we have got to defend ourselves. PAYNE: Of course, we have got 10 nuclear submarines. Apparently, though, they have some larger ones in development. And they're able to use technology stolen from America that maybe could mitigate the power of our nuclear ships. This is an emergency. There's something else that I read, Gordon, that made me think about you. It's in Nature magazine, of all things, the Seven Sons, those seven key universities in China, all started by the military, that have done joint academic papers with the U.S. military -- U.S. universities. This blows my mind. From 2013 to 2019, 254 of these science and technology papers, we have done this jointly with them. And all of the information that we gather and that we discover, they get to take back to the communist Chinese military. CHANG: Yes. And we have PLA, People's Liberation Army, researchers in the United States. Trump administration has revoked their visas. That's a very important step. But, also, Charles, we have companies like Google with artificial intelligence partnerships in China. Now, nominally, the parties on the other side of those partnerships are civilian. But because of China's civil-military fusion, which is a doctrine that Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, has been ruthlessly enforcing, it means that everything that Google does in China gets pipelined directly to the Chinese military. So, we're giving them the technology to configure their forces, to kill Americans. This is hideous. PAYNE: It's absolutely amazing. Gordon, I want you to hang right there. We're going to have more with you just in a moment, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: And we're back with Gordon Chang. And, Gordon, I want to transition to what's happening in Hong Kong. The whole world was watching. It felt like the Hong Kong activists were building up some form of momentum. And then the COVID-19 hit, and our attentions were transferred elsewhere. The U.N. sending a letter condemning these new laws in Hong Kong, the security laws. And it seems like China, with the world not watching, has become more aggressive. What are your thoughts there? CHANG: Well, it certainly has. It has used the new national security law, which was imposed on June 30, to take people off the streets, and also to attack local media, especially Apple Daily, which is the pro-democracy newspaper there. The Hong Kong government has postponed for a year elections that were supposed to take place today for the legislative council. And, instead, there were protests today. And the police basically arrested protesters for protesting the deferral of the elections. You know, I don't know if there's ever going to be elections in Hong Kong again, Charles. PAYNE: Wow. Well, speaking of the elections, The Global Times, which is essentially the mouthpiece for the Chinese government, the communist government there, endorsing Joe Biden, saying that he would be -- quote -- \"smoother\" to deal with than President Trump. (LAUGHTER) PAYNE: Smooth sounds like a euphemism for easier, no problems, a whole lot of things. CHANG: Yes, well, the trend of Chinese Communist Party and Chinese central government propaganda has been to unseat President Trump. From what we can tell of their troll farm and bot operations, they have also meant to disrupt Trump. And we have seen TikTok being used to aid the dirty tricks campaigns against Trump. So, really, there's been a concerted effort, which has been across the board. It's unprecedented. It's greater than anything that Russia may have done in 2016. PAYNE: Yes, you got to wonder if there's any of these folks who cheered the fact that TikTok might have tricked some Trump supporters earlier than this year, maybe have some egg on their face, understanding now, as the world has rejected TikTok, that it's just nothing more than a conduit to steal all of our information. But I want to stick on the cultural things. Before the break, we talked about universities. But China's influence is growing significantly beyond there, particularly in Hollywood. In Hong Kong, there is a major boycott against the recently released \"Mulan.\" Apparently, the lead actress there, she's expressed support for the police, perhaps support for the crackdown. And now there's a boycott, not just of the movie, but of also Disney. In the meantime, I don't think Americans realize how much power China has over Hollywood these days, Gordon. CHANG: Well, it certainly does, because, of course, there's a domestic film-going audience in China, and Hollywood studios want to take advantage of that. So they have changed the content of movies in ways where you see these big action thrillers where the Chinese step in and save the planet at the last moment. And that's no coincidence. They are doing this because Beijing demands it, and the Hollywood studios comply. PAYNE: What's particularly despicable, though, is that you have a whole lot of folks in America, actors and actresses, who will -- who are against American police forces, who really are pretty active against their disdain for our law enforcement here, but won't speak out on what's happening in China. And that's really unnerving. CHANG: Yes. And, certainly, that's also true for the NBA stars as well who express support for China. When they talk about racism in the U.S., they support the Chinese government, which is conducting genocide, mass detentions and concentration camps, institutionalized rape, slavery. That's what's going on in the northwestern part of the country. PAYNE: Right. And I know -- I think it's too late to turn their back. Hollywood is addicted to that cash. Gordon, we're addicted to you. You always give it to us straight. Thank you, my friend. All right, folks. Well, that does it for us, \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Charles Payne, in for Maria Bartiromo. We will see you during the week, \"Making Money,\" 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the FOX Business Network. Folks, have a safe and very healthy Labor Day weekend. We will see you soon.

Sign up\u00a0here.\u00a0**On the roster:\u00a0And yet, they will not play -\u00a0Minnesota governor pleads for peace - New pressure on Biden to pick a woman of color - RNC sets Wednesday deadline for convention deal - Kansas GOP uniting to stop Kobach - Cheers, JennieAND YET, THEY WILL NOT PLAY\u00a0This being America, you can like what you like. But here, we like baseball.This isn\u2019t to say anything unkind about other sports. Basketball, football, golf, hockey, racing and everything else from soccer to curling can be wonderful \u2013 good for participants and good to watch at every level.But baseball is better. It is not governed by a clock like the workday, but requires workmanlike devotion. It is not violent, but can be dangerous. It can be dominated by athleticism, but strategy always has its answers. And usually \u2013 usually \u2013 its season is so long that it takes on a lovely rhythm of its own.It is perfectly American. Born of English traditions, made in the Civil War, played by men of every station, race, place and creed. People around the world are drawn to it, and to us because of it. Cheap and simple for small groups to take up, capable of providing the kind of spectacle that holds hundreds of millions in its grasp.Now here you might say, \u201cI signed up for a political note, not some Boys\u2019 Life essay about America\u2019s pastime.\u201d And you would be right. But bear with us one minute more.Whether you like big-time football, seeing someone flipped like a chicken on a rotisserie in a mixed martial arts cage or are a synchronized swimmer, baseball is our game. You may not find it to be best, but like whatever kind of pizza comes from where you live, you still love it. We made it. It\u2019s been around forever. It\u2019s ours.Beyond the special privileges afforded in our national spirit that baseball enjoys, it also gets some very preferential treatment from governments municipal to federal. Baseball has been cashing in on this\u00a0Abner Doubleday\u00a0business for many decades.And yet, in the time of the year when baseball is sweetest and at the moment when America very much needs institutions to function in mature manners and when everyone needs something to smile about\u2026 they will not play.They\u2019re not worried about their health. There would be no fans. The owners and players wouldn\u2019t be slipping on face masks to head back into a pulmonary unit or changing sheets in a nursing home or scalding hogs. They would live and work in pristine bubbles where everyone is tested and safety is as assured as fresh, white horsehide for batting practice. And yet\u2026 they will not play.Reports now say that both sides \u2013 \u201cmanagement and labor\u201d seems funny to say with so many millionaires all around, but that\u2019s what it is \u2013 are considering skipping the season because it would just make more economic sense than coming up with a deal to play a half season. Only money.Here\u2019s a word, professional baseball: If you can\u2019t do this for the country, your fans and the kids looking for the sign that it would be safe and good to get back in the sunshine and play again, then you are refusing your duty.It\u2019s fine for everybody to look out for themselves. Our system not only allows it, it expects it. But our system also demands that people look beyond themselves and see each other as more than market participants, but as citizens in a great nation. And today that great nation is suffering mightily.If these owners and players are so callous to be oblivious to the needs and wants of their fellow Americans\u2019 hearts, what will the consequences be?It may seem a small thing thrust up against the latest death totals or the numbers from the Department of Labor, but it will matter if baseball\u00a0refuses\u00a0to work \u2013 if baseball owners and players go on strike against their own country in a crisis and blame coronavirus. A dim precedent, indeed.If these people can convince themselves to reject the chance to be the first major sport to play again, including an Independence Day start, then they have convinced themselves that they don\u2019t owe their fellow citizens their due.\u00a0Imagine if the rest of the people of our country faced these challenges that way. You can\u2019t because they wouldn\u2019t, even when institutions fail them and people who are supposed to be leaders think of themselves first. They don\u2019t have that luxury.But you could certainly excuse them for revoking baseball\u2019s \u201cnational pastime\u201d card once and for all.THE RULEBOOK: SOLDIER ON\u201cEven the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to [war\u2019s] dictates.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 8TIME OUT: COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNNatGeo: \u201cWhen RMS Titanic set sail in 1912, it was blessed and cursed with the latest in communication technology\u2014the wireless telegraph. In the last hours after Titanic hit an iceberg, radio messages sent from the storied sinking ship summoned a rescue vessel that saved hundreds of people, but also sowed confusion with competing distress calls and signal interference. More than 1,500 people died that fateful night. Now, a recent court ruling may pave the way to the recovery of Titanic\u2019s telegraph, designed by\u00a0Guglielmo Marconi, a telecommunications pioneer and 1909 Nobel Prize winner in physics who invented the first device to facilitate wireless communications using radio waves. \u2026 The tragedy led Marconi to bitterly regret his monopolistic decision to push longwave radio communication for maritime use. \u2018Now I have realized my mistake,\u2019 he said in a 1927 speech.\u201dFlag on the play?\u00a0- Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\u00a0PRESIDENTIAL POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)Toss-up:\u00a0(103 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15)Lean R/Likely R:\u00a0(186 electoral votes)\u00a0Lean D/Likely D:\u00a0(249 electoral votes)[Full rankings\u00a0here.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\u00a044.2 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a052.6 percentNet Score:\u00a0-8.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0no change in points[Average includes: American Research Group: 40% approve - 57% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; CNN: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 49% approve - 48% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The decision came one day after Mr. Trump signed an executive order taking aim at what he alleged was censorship by social-media companies, calling Twitter \u2018an editor with a viewpoint.\u2019 Mr. Trump, in tweets posted shortly after midnight on Friday, criticized protesters clashing with police in Minneapolis over the death of\u00a0George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white officer pinned him to the ground with a knee to his neck. The protests have turned increasingly violent, with a police station being set on fire overnight.\u00a0The president called the demonstrators thugs and warned: \u2018when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u2019\u201dBiden denounced violence, \u2018constant anxiety\u2019 for black America - Fox News: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden urged the demonstrators behind the violent protests in Minnesota \u2018to exercise their rights peacefully and safely.\u2019 But the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also called the death of a black man after being pinned to the ground for several minutes by Minneapolis police officers, which sparked three straight nights of rioting, a \u2018brutal, brutal death\u2019 which he emphasized exposes \u2018this ugly underbelly of our society.\u2019\u2026 Biden, speaking at a virtual fundraiser Thursday night, once again urged that the \u2018officers in the Floyd case must be held accountable, including with the FBI investigation and independent Department of Justice civil rights investigation.\u2019 Calling for calm as the protests raged, Biden urged \u2018the protesters to exercise their rights peacefully and safely.\u2019 But he acknowledged that \u2018people all across this country are enraged and rightly so. Everyday African-Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma of wondering, \u2018Will I be next?\u2019 Sounds like an exaggeration but it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201dNEW PRESSURE ON BIDEN TO PICK A WOMAN OF COLORWaPo: \u201cPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is facing growing pressure from activists and party leaders to pick a nonwhite running mate in the wake of explosive incidents involving race and police violence that have stoked widespread outrage. Biden has pledged to select a woman, prompting leading Democrats to publicly and privately promote several high-profile women of color for the job. Those calls have grown louder this week following the death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a racist conflict in a New York City park and the fatal shooting of a black jogger in Georgia. Biden\u2019s recent suggestion that African American voters who aren\u2019t already supporting him \u2018ain\u2019t black\u2019 and the coronavirus\u2019s disproportionate effect on nonwhite communities have added to the pressure.\u201dMinneapolis police brutality may end Klobuchar\u2019s veep hopes -\u00a0The [Minnesota] Star Tribune: \u201cThe death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody this week has renewed concerns about Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u2019s time as a Hennepin County prosecutor as she is being vetted as a potential running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The selection of Biden\u2019s No. 2 is unfolding as many blacks \u2014 a key voting bloc for the party \u2014 are looking for Biden to show he is not taking black voters for granted and that his ticket can excite those who sat out the 2016 election. Klobuchar\u2019s presidential bid was marked by an inability to gain inroads with black primary voters while at the same time facing criticism from civil rights activists attacking her decisions not to prosecute any of the officers in a string of police-involved fatalities when she was Hennepin County attorney.\u201dCortez Masto un-veeps herself -\u00a0AP: \u201cDemocratic Sen.\u00a0Catherine Cortez Masto\u00a0of Nevada said Thursday that she\u2019s not interested in serving as running mate to presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden. Cortez Masto, who in 2016 became the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate, said in a statement that she supports the former vice president but does not want to join the Democratic presidential ticket. \u2018I support Joe Biden 100% and will work tirelessly to help get him elected this November. It is an honor to be considered as a potential running mate but I have decided to withdraw my name from consideration,\u2019 Cortez Masto said in a statement. She noted that Nevada\u2019s economy is one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus, with the worst unemployment rate in the nation at 28.2%. She said she will focus on getting Nevada residents back on their feet.\u201dBiden campaign nixes fundraiser with Mueller deputy -\u00a0Bloomberg: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s campaign has canceled a fundraiser that was to feature\u00a0Robert Mueller\u2019s top deputy in the Russia investigation, a person familiar with the move said.\u00a0The event with\u00a0Andrew Weissmann\u00a0had been scheduled for June 2 and was to be a \u2018fireside chat\u2019 with former New Jersey Attorney General\u00a0Anne Milgram. Tickets started at $500 and went up to $5,600. Allies of President Donald Trump argued during the Mueller probe that Weissmann, who was first appointed to a federal post by President\u00a0George H.W. Bush, was not objective in his duties because he gave $2,300 to Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. The Biden campaign declined to comment.\u201dRNC SETS WEDNESDAY DEADLINE FOR CONVENTION DEALWaPo: \u201cThe Republican National Committee set a June 3 deadline for North Carolina officials to approve their planned in-person political convention in August, despite continuing uncertainty over the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has upended the presidential campaign. In a letter sent Thursday evening to Gov.\u00a0Roy Cooper, the RNC outlined a number of safety protocols it said it would invoke during the convention in Charlotte, an apparent response to the Democratic governor\u2019s request for a safety plan. The deadline was roughly the same set by President Trump in remarks Tuesday. The letter did not address some basic safety concerns, omitting, for example, whether attendees would be required to wear masks or take a coronavirus test before entering the Spectrum Arena where the convention would be held. Federal health authorities have strongly recommended the use of masks for any gatherings in which attendees cannot properly distance themselves \u2014 which would be the case in a convention drawing thousands of delegates and others.\u201d\u2018Trumptilla\u2019 ahoy\u00a0-\u00a0Politico: \u201cPresident Trump can\u2019t hold his large energetic rallies because of coronavirus. But his campaign has discovered the next best thing: massive pro-Trump flotillas that are taking his message to waterways across the country. The large boat parades \u2014 which began organically among MAGA devotees in South Florida and spread to Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, Arizona\u2019s Lake Havasu, South Carolina\u2019s Charleston Harbor and Southern California\u2019s Newport Harbor during Memorial Day weekend \u2014 quickly caught the notice of the president and his campaign. Now, the campaign is encouraging the flotillas and utilizing its robust data operation to organize and excite a demographic that turns out to be heavily represented in some of the most closely-contested swing states from the Sun Belt to the Great Lakes.\u201dKANSAS GOP UNITING TO STOP KOBACHThe Kansas City Star: \u201cKansas Senate President\u00a0Susan Wagle\u00a0has dropped out of the race for U.S. Senate four days ahead of the filing deadline. The Wichita Republican\u2019s decision to forgo the race to replace retiring Sen.\u00a0Pat Roberts\u00a0comes hours after Kansans For Life\u2019s PAC announced its decision to endorse Rep. Roger Marshall. It was a huge blow to Wagle\u2019s candidacy, which was framed largely around her efforts to pass an anti-abortion amendment this legislative session. Wagle pointed to conversations with party leaders and concerns that a divided Republican electorate could be boost to Democrat\u00a0Barbara Bollier\u00a0in the general election. \u2026\u00a0Wagle\u2019s decision to drop out ahead of the filing deadline will likely help boost Marshall, the congressman from western Kansas, who has been trying to establish himself as the main alternative to former Kansas Secretary of State\u00a0Kris Kobach, the party\u2019s 2018 nominee for governor.\u201dRepublicans recruit record numbers of women, minorities -\u00a0Fox News: \u201c[C]onservative groups are contributing to what is a historically diverse field of Republican House candidates, with record numbers of women and minorities running in 2020. To date, more than 180 minorities have filed to run for the House of Representatives as Republicans, according to The New York Times, and over 200 women have filed nationwide, according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP).\u201dSENATE DEMS DEMUR ON ANOTHER ROUND OF CHECKSThe Hill: \u201cHouse Democrats looking to deliver another round of $1,200 relief checks to Americans are encountering skepticism from an unexpected source \u2014 fellow Democrats in the Senate. The $3 trillion House-passed measure is not only facing opposition from GOP senators, it\u2019s also prompting Senate Democrats to raise concerns about what they see as a huge untargeted expenditure. Sen.\u00a0Ben Cardin\u00a0(D-Md.), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said he wants the next round of coronavirus relief to be more focused on the households that have been hardest hit by the economic downturn brought on by the pandemic. \u2026 Cardin said the direct payments made more sense in March when Congress wanted to get money out the door as quickly as possible. But now, as states are allowing businesses to reopen around the country, he says lawmakers should look at who will most need relief in the coming months.\u201dBipartisan bill to ease business loan terms sails through House -\u00a0Forbes: \u201cThe House of Representatives on Thursday passed new legislation that would make it easier for businesses to have their Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven by relaxing restrictions on how the loan money can be used and extending the period that businesses have to use the funds. The bill would extend the forgiveness period for PPP loans from eight to 24 weeks. It would also reduce payroll spending requirements from 75% of loan funds to 60% of loan funds, giving businesses more flexibility in deciding how to allocate the emergency funds, and extend a June 30 deadline to hire workers back. \u2026 The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was introduced by Rep.\u00a0Chip Roy\u00a0(R-Texas) and Rep.\u00a0Dean Phillips\u00a0(D-Minn.). It passed in the House on Thursday with a vote of 471-1; only Rep.\u00a0Thomas Massie\u00a0(R-KY) voted no. \u2026 This bill is now headed to the Senate, where it is expected to pass.\u201dILLINOIS RELENTS ON CHURCHES, CALIFORNIA WON\u2019TPolitico: \u201cThe governors of Illinois and California took somewhat different tacks Thursday night as they urged the Supreme Court not to get involved in disputes over the impact of virus-related lockdown orders on churches in their states. Hours before a deadline to respond to two churches\u2019 request for an emergency stay to allow them to have more than 10 people in attendance at Pentecost services this Sunday, Gov.\u00a0J.B. Pritzker\u00a0(D-Ill.) announced that he was dropping all legal restrictions on religious gatherings and replacing them with voluntary \u2018guidance.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0By contrast, California's Democratic Gov.\u00a0Gavin Newsom\u2019s most recent virus-response plan includes the same numerical standards for churches, but makes the limits mandatory rather than optional.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYContinetti: Republicans right to worry\u00a0-\u00a0Washington Free BeaconTrump announces extension for National Guard's coronavirus deployment\u00a0-\u00a0Politico\u00a0AUDIBLE: WHICH IS NICE\u201cI'm much more focused myself on things like virtual reality, which would let anyone teleport anywhere in the world or in the universe that they want without having to physically strap themselves to a rocket.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Facebook founder\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0when asked by\u00a0Dana Perino\u00a0if he had any interest in going into space.ANY GIVEN SUNDAYTune in this weekend as Mr. Sunday sits down with Sen.\u00a0Tim Scott, R-S.C.

Watch #mediabuzz Sundays at 11 a.m. ET.FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cI just watched the six hour History channel special on Gen. Grant.\u00a0 Interesting, if you don't mind a huge number of commercials. But, it reminded me that Pres. Lincoln, a Republican, freed the slaves. Lincoln's successor, Pres. Johnson did very little to help the South recover from the Civil War, and then Pres. Grant, a Republican, worked hard to help the South and establish rights for the Blacks. He almost stopped the KKK.\u00a0But he was replaced by a Democrat, and the KKK rose again and the South had segregation for many years, basically until a Republican President, Eisenhower, stopped it. Forward to more modern times, and it seems like every time there is a Republican President our black citizens move ahead.\u00a0 Prior to the virus, under President Trump the black unemployment rate was the lowest in history. \u00a0Yet, the Democrats continue to campaign under the assumption that the large majority of black voters will vote for a Democrat. Any Democrat. I don't understand why.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Richard Hardman, Orlando, Fla.[Ed. note: I don\u2019t wish to make this a fact-checking exercise, Mr. Hardman, but we should point out that Grant was succeeded by fellow Republican, Ohioan and Civil War general,\u00a0Rutherford B. Hayes. There wouldn\u2019t be a Democratic president until 1885, one of only two in the 72 years between 1861 and 1933.\u00a0Dwight Eisenhower\u00a0certainly acted decisively to enforce the Supreme Court ruling banning school segregation. But actual desegregation was a long, painful process that included the Democrat-led Civil Rights Act (check out\u00a0Harry Enten\u2019s\u00a0great historical breakdown\u00a0of that vote), but more than anything the willingness of\u00a0Martin Luther King\u00a0and civil rights protesters to sacrifice themselves to shame Americans North and South into ending legal segregation. But I know what you mean: Why are black voters not more grateful to Republicans who ended slavery and have at various times presided over economic booms? Let me try it this way: The New Deal, the five-day work week, the eight-hour day, occupational safety requirements, farm loans, the G.I. Bill and so much of what was built to benefit white, working-class Americans came from Democrats and the left. So why aren\u2019t these white folks more grateful? Why do working-class whites vote overwhelmingly Republican despite all the ways Republicans fought those things in the past 100 years? Why do older white Americans, who benefit so much from Medicare and Social Security turn their backs on the party of F.D.R.? They would probably say that the Democratic Party is very different now, and they would be right. They might also say that they feel more at home culturally in a party dominated by those who share their values. And that would be just fine. Nobody owes anybody their vote, whether they are black or white, Democrat or Republican. We are free people, and it is unseemly when partisans of either party make such demands of racial fealty. That goes for telling someone \u201cyou ain\u2019t black\u201d if you vote for the other guy, and it also goes for telling someone they owe you their support because of the events of 150 years ago and the swings of the business cycle.]\u201cIt's been a minute; I've been tuning out from recent political and news shenanigans, and getting my news from The Five and Special Report. I have been keeping up with your newsletter, but just have not been motivated to chime in. Some of your Bleachers' comments have stirred me to end my self-imposed exile!\u00a0First and foremost, I consider myself a conservative libertarian, and am very excited to see mention of Jo Jorgensen in your column. Hopefully, she'll know where Aleppo is. We are indeed stuck with, again, the two worst alternatives who could only lose to each other. Don't get me wrong; I am a performance guy, and like how Trump \"makes his own weather\", as you say, even if a lot of it is repugnant. Which leads me to item two: the divisiveness another writer sent in. If Trump wins (and I suspect he will), what is going to happen in the following four years? Not so much in Congress; I expect more of the same from those critters. What's going to happen in the country? I can see some serious secessionist movements taking place in the \u2018Acela Corridor,\u2019 and on the west coast. And, if it were to happen, in what form? It would make the remainder solid Red. The negotiations for defense, currency, etc. would be, um, wow.\u00a0You and Brianna keep up the good work.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Jeff Smith, Warner Robins, Ga.[Ed. note: Oh now, Mr. Smith! Let\u2019s press a pause button on secession today. The most valuable deception that partisans maintain these days is that each election is an existential choice. Remember what Democrats said about Trump? Literally\u00a0the apocalypse. He\u2019s certainly banged his head on the ductwork\u00a0quite a bit, but not unlike\u00a0Bill Clinton, figured out a way to have an administration amidst chaos. Democrats now say it would be four more years that we can\u2019t survive. Republicans are just as bad, likening Democrats to\u00a0terrorists bent on destroying the country\u00a0and now warning that America can\u2019t survive four years of a careerist senator from Delaware as president. Blah, blah, blah, blah\u2026 Demagogues want you scared and angry so that you are more easily manipulated, to follow your feelings instead of reason. Look, America\u2019s got big fat problems, perhaps chief among them is the weakness of our institutions -- institutions that have been strip mined for credibility by self-seeking politicians. But we are strong, we are resilient, and we are, after every other option has been tried, bound to do the right thing.

Pennsylvania state Republicans filed a petition with the Supreme Court Monday evening, pushing the now eight-justice high court to face their first challenge without the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. State GOP members have requested the Supreme Court review and reverse the recent decision by the Pennsylvania high court that\u00a0granted a three-day extension for mail-in ballots\u00a0following the close of polls on Nov. 3, The Hill first reported Tuesday. Traditionally the battleground state required all mail-in ballots\u00a0to be submitted by the end of day on Election Day. PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT EXTENDS STATE MAIL BALLOT DEADLINE TO 3 DAYS AFTER ELECTION Now mail-in ballots that are received by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6 will be accepted so long as they are postmarked by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3. The Republican Party of Pennsylvania (RPP)\u00a0took issue with Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that ballots received without postage or an indication of when they were mailed \u201cwill be presumed to have been mailed by Election Day,\u201d unless there is proof of submission after the newly established deadline. \u201cThe Court\u2019s judgment \u2026 creates a serious likelihood that Pennsylvania\u2019s imminent general election will be tainted by votes that were illegally cast or mailed after Election Day,\u201d said the court filing\u00a0by the RPP, echoing President Trump\u2019s claims that mail-in voting will result in an increase of fraudulent ballots. Trump and other members of the GOP have repeatedly claimed that the expected increase in mail-in voting will lead to invalid election results. Pennsylvania's high court determined that they had the power to grant the new mail-in voting measures as Pennsylvania\u2019s Election Code says that courts have the \u201cauthority to provide relief when there is a natural disaster or emergency,\u201d\u00a0in order to give residents the ability to exercise their right to vote. The GOP has argued that as the state's General Assembly adjusted the state primaries in light of the coronavirus pandemic, but did not\u00a0alter any deadlines surrounding the General Election, that it is not a necessity caused by the global pandemic \u2013 as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court argued. \u201cThe Court should have upheld the received-by deadline and adopted the narrower remedy of altering the deadline for voters to apply for absentee or mail-in ballots,\u201d the RPP argued, saying if anything there should be tighter restrictions around mail-in voting. MICHIGAN JUDGE SAYS BALLOTS RECEIVED WITHIN 14 DAYS OF ELECTION SHOULD COUNT IF POSTMARKED ON TIME The court\u2019s decision, which was seen as a win for state Democrats, comes amid the coronavirus pandemic, which will likely lead to less American\u2019s casting their vote in person \u2013 increasing the use of the mail-in ballot during the 2020 presidential election. Pennsylvania, along with 18 other states and the District of Colombia, have granted deadline extensions to allow ballots to be counted even after the polls close. Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas and Pennsylvania are swing states that voted red in the 2016 presidential election \u2013 they have also all permitted the acceptance of postmarked ballots that arrive after Election Day. Though members of the GOP in several states are pushing against the easing of restrictions surrounding mail-in ballots, Trump actually applauded the state's decision\u00a0to permit deadline extensions during a White House press briefing Friday. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a terrible time for this country and we are counting on federal judges to do a great constitutional job,\u201d Trump said after applauding Michigan and Pennsylvania\u2019s decisions last week to grant ballot acceptance extensions. Trump has repeatedly called mail-in voting a \u201cscam\u201d and questioned the security and legitimacy around the alternative method of voting, despite scant evidence of voter fraud in previous general elections, where over 40% of Americans voted by mail in 2016 and 2012, according to the\u00a0Election Assistance Commission. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More than half of all Americans are expected to vote by mail this election because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSuch last-minute changes by court order can engender widespread \u2018voter confusion,\u2019 erode public \u2018confidence in the integrity of our electoral process,\u2019 and create an \u2018incentive to remain away from the polls\u2019,\u201d claimed the Pennsylvania Republican Party. The RPP has requested the U.S. Supreme Court make a ruling by Friday.",
